        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Picture House is a beloved movie theatre that carries popcorn, soda, and that good old-fashioned charm.

As one of the few remaining single-screen theaters, It was rescued from the brink of demolition in 2001, and a non-profit dedicated to its upkeep, Pelham Picture House Preservation, was established. It has since been rebranded as The Pelham Picture House Regional Film Center and added to the National Registry of Historic Places in 2010.

Celebrating its centennial in 2021 did not only celebrate its resiliency as a cultural hub but also the countless community events that it proudly hosted and displayed on the marquee, including (but by no means limited to) watching a local Olympians race live on the big screen, children's parties, and school events.

So whether you're a film lover, a history buff, or just someone who is looking to eat some good old-fashioned popcorn, the Picture House is the perfect way to spend your afternoon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many cities have founding myths that explain some aspect of their history and sometimes their name. Kielce, a city in southern Poland, is no different, though their story certainly is quite unique. A statue on the town square depicts a large imposing boar, which is situated on top of a pedestal and surrounded by six brass plates that tell its story.  

The story centers around Prince  Mieszko Bolesławowic, son of the 11th-century Polish King Bolesław II. The prince was sent out into the woods with a large army escort on a hunting trip after the king got into an argument with the Bishop of Krakow and feared for his son's life in retaliation.  

In the woods, the prince and his men found and slayed many beasts, while living an otherwise unremarkable life. That is until one day, when Prince Mieszko saw a giant boar and decided to follow it on his own. This nearly ended in tragedy as he drove into a branch and was knocked out cold.

While he was unconscious, the prince dreamt that someone had given him poison and that he was dying. However, just before the end Saint Wojciech appeared and healed the prince with cleansing water that appeared from a spot below his cane. The prince woke up to discover that he had been found and helped by his men. To his surprise, he also saw the river from his dreams, and also a pair of large boar tusks (Kły) on the place where he was knocked out. 

He decided to build a city here on this holy spot, and called it after the boar's tusks: Kielce.]]></summary>

Though it is many miles from the sites of the attacks on that tragic day, the 9/11 Memorial Trail in Athens, Georgia, is filled with meaning. 

After a trip to New York City just one month after the attacks, artist Bob Hart—who had been moved by the hushed reverence of the other passengers on his flight, then the flowers and missing posters on the chain link fences—decided that he had to do something to help others remember those whose lives had been lost. The final result of his work is a 300-yard wooded trail on his property that has been visited by people from across the country for more than 20 years.

The wellhead was commissioned by Thomas Billingham as a gift to the city at a time when safe, fresh water was not always easy to locate. The wellhead protected the water source and preserved the quality of the water in the well.  These wellheads were the first line of defense for preventing contaminants from entering the water supply.

The wellhead at Fram is a low, rectangular structure with buttresses on each corner and a sloped roof. There is a now bricked doorway on the south-facing side and a small slot along the east side.

The wellhead is a Grade II listed building and was first listed in 1952.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the Peephole Cinema in San Francisco, this small-scale destination for bibliophiles is similarly out of view, tucked up against a building in a tree-lined urban alleyway/POPOS (no, not police officers, but a Privately-Owned Public Open Space) in Downtown San Francisco.

The store inhabits three showcase windows just two feet deep and 14 feet wide. Once a display space for the I. Magnin & Co. department store, it's now a thoughtfully curated selection of books, zines, art, and other paper ephemera, as well as a few book carts on wheels. The space found its second life as a bookstore in 2012, when G.F. “Rick” Wilkinson transformed the former display windows into a small bookstore. It became a fixture in the neighborhood.

When Wilkinson decided to close the store in order to focus on his online bookselling business, a new group took over running the beloved store, which was renamed 34 Trinity Arts and News.

Run by a dedicated cadre of volunteers, this diminutive oasis of reading materials (with a focus on San Francisco-based writers, authors, and subjects) provides a much-needed respite from the glass and steel monoliths that loom over it. 34 Trinity occasionally collaborates with other local businesses to host various events including art exhibitions and poetry readings.]]></summary>

According to the Sufi, the djinns were created by Allah when the world was new, fashioned from fire while mankind was made from clay. In English, they are called genies—the very beings that pop up every now and then in Arabian Nights stories. Locals believe that these ancient spirits haunt the Muslim quarters of Old Delhi, granting wishes of those who pray.

Like most great works of art, Otto began his life as a high school shop project, the brainchild of shop teacher Tom Willett, who wanted to create something special for Fergus Falls’s centennial in 1972. Unfortunately, the first version of Otto was…an otter disaster. Steve Jaenisch, a metal artist who went on to create a number of sculptures around town, finished the job and made sure Otto would last for generations to come.

Today, the 40-foot-long otter sculpture stands proudly in Adams Park, overlooking the lake. The quaint city park also includes a ballfield, a playground, and picnic tables, including one that is often placed tantalizingly close to Otto.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This water storage facility, which also controls Bangor’s water pressure, has been in use since 1897. It also inspired a piece of Stephen King's 1986 novel It: the standpipe in Derry, where Stan first encounters Pennywise.

Bangor’s most famous resident Stephen King once lived a few blocks away from the standpipe. According to him, he also wrote a significant portion of his book It in the shadow of the standpipe. In the early 1980s, he would walk down the street, sit on a park bench in the small park beneath the standpipe, and write the book. It is said that the tragic stairwell death of the boy in 1940 influenced the creation of the book’s character Pennywise the Clown.

There are no recorded drowning accidents in the standpipe, but for anyone who has read the book or seen either the film or the miniseries, this is an incredibly eerie place to be—even though you’re just staring at an old water tower. Which tells you everything you need to know about the power of King’s writing.

In the 2017 remake of the movie It, one of the characters bikes by a standpipe in the fictional town of Derry, which is King’s thinly disguised version of Bangor. The standpipe was CGI-generated and the movie was filmed in Toronto. There are also references to the standpipe in his other books Dreamcatcher and 11/22/63.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last Chance Module Array was an art project created by M12 Studios in 2015. This is how M12 Studio describes it: "Alone in the landscape, it appears newly built or, just as easily, to have always been there, disintegrating over decades."

The installation is designed to align with the horizon, and lines up perfectly with the rising and setting sun during the summer and winter solstices. M12 studios states that the "design of the structures is expressive of farm and prairie architecture like barns and other farm structures.”

Even when it isn’t the solstice it is a beautiful sculpture in the middle of nowhere. There is no sign or even a path to get to the sculpture, but you can see it on the east side of the street. You’ll need to walk up a small hill and then through grasslands to get to the sculpture.

There is very little else around in Last Chance, Colorado, so there’s a part of this whole adventure that feels like one has come upon this hidden art creation that no one else knows about.]]></summary>

Mike Lohrengel looks up in awe at trees he has known for 30 years. “This is one of the most beautiful places I know. This forest has it all: the most species, the most diversity. Many trees I know individually. Look at this one behind us. It’s got a split way up there. I’ll never forget that tree till I die.”

It is a love affair, for sure. But Lohrengel is no tree-hugger, out to preserve a special, pristine place. He is a timber harvest administrator, overseeing logging in one of the most remarkable working forests in the United States—nearly a quarter-million acres of trees that occupy almost the entire Menominee Indian Reservation in northern Wisconsin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The San Jacinto Mountains, an upthrust fault block resulting from the San Andreas fault system, rise abruptly east of the Los Angeles basin. With a high point at San Jacinto Peak (10,804 feet/3,294 meters), the range is tall enough to intercept the moisture coming from the Pacific, such that the higher elevations support forests and even a winter snow cap. However, this also causes a rain-shadow desert on the eastern side of the range. The mountain precipitation feeds a number of perennial streams that drain to the east, of which one of the largest is Tahquitz (pronounced TAH-keets) Creek.

The creek drops steeply down the eastern front of the range through a spectacular canyon, from which it formerly flowed out into the desert where the city of Palm Springs now sits. As with any desert creek, its water was of paramount importance for wildlife and the local human population.

Near the base of the range, where its grade flattens out, the creek flows over a picturesque waterfall some 60 feet high that can be reached by a footpath. The path runs about 1.8 miles through a scenic desert canyon with an altitude gain of 350 feet. The level is moderate and should be within the capabilities of most hikers. Some rock art is also visible. The creek and falls both lie within the Agua Caliente Cahuilla Reservation and the tribe sells hiking permits.

Tahquitz, in the local Native American lore, was a malevolent spirit that dwelled in the mountains.]]></summary>

Think of the Gulf of Guinea, part of the South Atlantic Ocean, as Africa’s armpit. It’s the body of water just off the coast of where West Africa bends south to become Central Africa. The Gulf is right in the middle of your standard world map, and that’s no coincidence. It is the meeting point of the two baselines of geodetic measurement, the prime meridian and the equator.

The piece is made up of two diamond-studded wings perched atop a gold halo. Relatives who inherited the diamond-studded tiara wound up selling it to a Las Vegas pawn shop, a sale that was featured on the History Channel show Pawn Stars.

Museum staff had known about the tiara's existence—they had borrowed the piece from the family members a number of times over the years. But it wasn't until they saw it on TV that they knew that it was up for sale. 

After the episode aired, curators from the McKinley Presidential Library convinced Rick Harrison, co-owner of Gold & Silver Pawn, to sell it to them. He agreed on the condition that the museum was able to meet the amount he paid for it: $43,000.

The museum put together a fundraising campaign, and hundreds of donations from across the country enabled the museum to buy the tiara back. It is now on permanent display at the museum, in its original velvet jewelry box and inside a protective glass case]]></summary>

Christopher McCandless was an adventurer who went by the pseudonym "Alexander Supertramp." McCandless traveled across North America in the early 1990s. He ventured into the Alaskan bush in 1992 with minimal supplies, hoping to live off the land. Eventually, McCandless came across an abandoned bus near the Sushana River that he used as a makeshift shelter. It would also become his final resting place. 

In 1996, Jon Krakauer published Into The Wild, a book following McCandless's journey that became an international bestseller. In 2007, the book was adapted into a movie directed by Sean Penn and starring Emile Hirsch as McCandless. A replica of the so-called "Magic Bus" was created for the movie, and after filming was done it found a permanent home at 49th State Brewing.

As for the real bus. it remained at its remote site for many years, and visiting it became a pilgrimage for people who had been inspired by McCandless's story. But after at least 15 people had to be rescued and two people died attempting to cross the Teklanika River, the bus was airlifted out in June 2020. It was moved to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where there are plans to put it on display at the Museum of the North.]]></summary>

It’s important to define "organized baseball," because night baseball had been taking place off and on since the sport's creation. The earliest known game of artificially illuminated baseball took place on September 2, 1880, at Nantasket Beach, Massachusetts. Exhibition games would regularly be played with artificial lighting, however, professional sports resisted the innovation–particularly all major and minor leagues covered by the National Agreement governed by Major League Baseball.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the early 20th century, the Soudan Iron Mine awarded employees of the mine lots on neighboring Stuntz Bay on Lake Vermilion to build boathouses. The employees were tasked with supplying their own materials and labor for the construction of their boathouses. Most were built with tamarack logs and reclaimed corrugated metal from the mine.

Over 140 of these boathouses still stand today, albeit in various states of disrepair, with some renovated for continued use, and some crumbling into the bay. The boathouses now reside within the boundaries of Soudan Underground Mine State Park and have been listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.

The owners of any boathouses not already surrendered to the park will be the last generation to own them, as current rules prohibit the transfer of ownership under any circumstances. Once the owner dies or surrenders ownership, the boathouse becomes the property of the park. This leaves the fate of the boathouses uncertain, as it's likely the park will not repair or restore them once they've taken ownership.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune has one of the largest collections of rare books and manuscripts in South Asia. Within the grounds of the institute, next to the main building, stands an impressive guest house. It was built in 1933 with funds granted by Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad.

The guest house was built to accommodate the researchers and scholars who used to visit the institute for study and research. According to historians, along with the funds of Rs. 50,000/- for the construction of the guest house, the Nizam had also granted Rs. 1,000/- per year for 11 years for the publication of the Mahabharata by the institute.

 On April 15, 1948, Dr. M. R. Jayakar was appointed as the first Vice Chancellor of the University of Poona (later the University of Pune and now Savitribai Phule Pune University). He was in search of a place to establish the office of the varsity and start working, since the current university building was then the seasonal retreat and monsoon residence of the Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) and was called the Governor House.

Dr. R. N. Dandekar, the then secretary of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute suggested Dr. Jayakar to set up the university office at the Nizam’s Guest House. Soon thereafter, the office of the university was started from here and was located here until June 1, 1949.

In 1949, the University was allocated land of over 411 acres, which is its current campus. The erstwhile Governor's House has become the main office building of the university since then. 

The Nizam’s Guest House is a beautiful stately building with elegantly designed balconies, windows, corridors, and archways. It has been declared a Grade 1 Heritage Structure and is evocative of a bygone era, reminding passersby of the city’s fascinating history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Strauss Airstrip, also known locally as the Strauss Airfield, 27 Mile Field, and the Humpty Doo Strip, was a landing strip found in the Northern Territory of Australia.

It was constructed over a period between March and April of 1942 and was a key part of Australia's air defense during World War II. This is one of the most intact military installations in all of Northern Australia and was added to the Northern Territory Heritage Register due to its cultural and historic significance.

The airfield was named after United States Captain Allison W. Strauss, a P-40 Kittyhawk pilot who lost their life after crashing into Darwin Harbour during a Japanese air raid on April 27, 1942. The site was decommissioned at the end of 1945, and in recent years, information signs have been installed along with the placement of model aircraft.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This tiny store located in the Arc de Triomf area has been a temple for emo teens, goths, and kawaii lovers since 2010. But what catches the interest of visitors is to find an incredibly colorful spot in the middle of the street, with its quirky, busy tiny space decorated with a big collection of subculture relics on their walls.

The museum-like decor shows a wide variety of everything alternative youth dreams of: from "kawaii" pop culture items, Japanese toys from the 60s, vintage anime rare novelties, to the dreamed room of an emo teen. This collection is not for sale in the store (it is actually a clothing and secondhand store), so their employees ended up adding signs to avoid the many daily inquiries about purchasing.

The collection has been composed by the owners and employees throughout their lives. Every item has a little history with their respective owner, and are exposed to share the deep love for underground culture with every person that steps into the little store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1950s, the town of Silverton, Colorado was in a troubled situation. The largest mine in the county had closed and the railroad that brought tourists from Durango was struggling. The idea for a large Christ statue in Silverton was first conceived at a Catholic men’s club in 1958. It was the hope that such a statue might revitalize the spirit of the town, and perhaps even the economy. 

The slopes of Anvil Mountain were chosen as the site for the shrine since it overlooked the entire city. The statue itself was fashioned from 12 tons of Italian Carrara marble, the same source as Michelangelo’s "David". The alcove around the statue was made from stone local to the area. The catholic church provided financial support. The townspeople of Silverton also donated their money, supplies, and labor to the project. In 1959, the statue was complete, standing an impressive 16 feet on its pedestal.

Shortly after the construction of the shrine, the Sunnyside Mine was reopened providing new employment to the citizens of Silverton. It is unknown if the new shrine played any part in the decision to reopen the mines. However, when the mines flooded in 1978, many credited the shrine for protecting the miners. While all the mines in Silverton are now closed for good, the Christ of the Mines still endures as a monument to Silverton’s history and the resilience of its people.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinnm," Luxembourgish for "We want to stay what we are," is the national motto of Luxembourg. As a very small country in the center of Western Europe, Luxembourg has braved a tumultuous history of fighting and bartering for its independence from multiple invading and occupying forces. This motto speaks to the ambition of the Luxembourgish people to retain their independence, identity, and sovereignty.

The motto is pulled from Luxembourgish patriotic song, written in 1859 by De Feierwon. In Luxembourgish, the lyrics of the chorus read: "Kommt hier aus Frankräich, Belgie, Preisen, / Mir wellen iech ons Hémecht weisen, / Frot dir no alle Säiten hin, / Mir welle bleiwe wat mir sin."

In English, this translates as: "Come here from France, Belgium, Prussia, / we want to show you our fatherland / ask in all directions, / We want to stay what we are."

Although this motto is posted in many places across Luxembourg, this version, which is painted on an ancient tower above Rue de la Loge is probably the most famous.]]></summary>

It's the smallest of the three remaining covered bridges in Delaware, all of which are located in New Castle County. While the original Smith's and Wooddale Bridges were both built before Ashland Bridge, the former two have been rebuilt, making Ashland Bridge the oldest, original bridge in Wilmington.

On at least three occasions, this diminutive Delaware bridge has been closed down due to damage from oversized trucks. In 2021, the bridge was damaged by debris that slammed into it during Hurricane Ida. This resulted in a six-week closure in 2023, but as of August, the bridge was re-opened to traffic.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Observatories are rarely found in the middle of a city due to the light pollution emitted by the nearby houses, this makes the Urania observatory a rare and surprisingly accessible gem of Zurich.

The land on which it stands was once owned by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) and had several observatories at this location throughout the centuries. However, it was bought by a businessman named Weill-Einstein at the turn of the 18th century. The only condition was that "a beautiful building appropriate to the location of the building site be built on the building site within five years of the transfer of ownership." 

This demand was fulfilled through the construction of a public observatory.

The observatory was completed in 1907 and was the first concrete building in the city, it was also fully separate from the surrounding building to minimize vibrations. Despite this technology, no science was ever done in the tower, instead, it has always been used to teach astronomy and explain how telescopes work. 

Inside the building is a beautiful Zeiss refractor that was custom-built for this tower. The telescope has a length of 16 feet (five meters). It's described by Zeiss as a 'Urania Type.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his essay Atomic Thoughts, Matt Gemmell writes about the atomicity of ideas. The principle of atomicity is a guiding principle for understanding a larger and complicated idea. Its power lies in the fact that it mimics how our mind works. The recommendation for application could be summarised as follows:
Whenever you come across a train of thought that is difficult to grasp, break it down into smaller and thus easier to understand components.
Unfortunately, this is only half the truth.
Analysis is only a part of understanding, but not understanding itself
Breaking down the idea is undoubtedly valuable because it gets to the root of the problem of understanding: it is not the length of the distance our mind has to travel that challenges us. Rather, it is the question of what the first ste…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the vast insect collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., one small box of beetles stands out from countless others. Currently it sits on the desk of Floyd Shockley, the museum’s entomology collections manager. He’s spent his spare summer hours in 2023 meticulously working on the contents of this box—re-placing rhinestones and replica rubies. The box contains 28 maquech beetles: bedazzled bugs once meant to be worn as living jewelry.

“I can’t say for sure, but I’d wager this is one of the best and most well-rounded collections in terms of different decorative styles of maquechs,” he says.

Maquech, or makech, beetles are objects of legend, and also tourist trinkets and sources of concern for both border control and conservationists. Sold al…]]></summary>

Penney,” and you’ll likely be met with a description of big box stores in dying shopping malls of various cities and suburbs. And yet, this retail giant actually got its start in the remote rural town of Kemmerer, Wyoming, where its “Mother Store” still exists today.

James Cash Penney, Jr. was born outside Hamilton, Missouri, in 1875. After moving west in hopes that the weather would be good for his health, he ended up working for Thomas Callahan and Guy Johnson, who owned the Golden Rule dry goods store chain operating throughout Colorado and Wyoming. In 1902, Callahan and Johnson gave Penney seed money to open a store in Ogden, Utah. Believing that market to be too large, Penney suggested Kemmerer as an a…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-07T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Otaru was known for its herring fisheries during the last half of the 19th century. Its golden year was 1897, when it scored a record total of a near-million ton of herrings—accounting for six-tenths of that year's national catch.

Like a gold rush, the abundance of fish attracted opportunity-seekers and drove them out to sea. Collectively referred to as yan-shū in the north, these fishermen were known for their rough nature and their sea shanty called Sōran Bushi, which continues to be remembered as one of Japan's most iconic folk songs.

In Otaru, the yan-shū lodged in dormitories at massive mansions called Nishin-Goten. Built by the nouveau riche who had made their fortunes from huge catches of herrings, these wooden "herring palaces" typically stood on the hilltop by the seaside so that any shoal of herrings was not missed.

Few herring palaces have survived over the years, but few of those standing today are herring palaces, technically speaking. A majority of them are either banya, smaller-scale lodges for the herring fishermen, or villas built by the fishery bosses for themselves.

Standing on a hilltop along the Ishikari Bay coastline is the Otaru Herring Palace, the "real" Nishin-Goten completed in 1897. Initially built in Shakotan, it was moved to its current location in 1958 and is now managed by the Otaru Aquarium as a historic monument and museum.

On display are mainly fishermen’s equipment and old photographs, as well as scenes from Otaru’s fishery past re-enacted by dolls and in dioramas. Still, the main exhibit is the building itself. The lodging area, the spacious hall, and the wooden beams, all hearken back to the heyday of Otaru's herring era. Visitors can also feel the past in fishermen's clothes that can be worn for free.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As travelers cross the Kansas-Oklahoma border while heading north on Highway 81, they may happen upon a seemingly unsettling sight near Caldwell, Kansas. In the distance, a caravan of riders is traveling alongside you, driving cattle. These silhouetted figures are known as the "Ghost Riders of the Chisholm Trail."

The Abilene stockyards opened in 1866, providing a new, safer, and shorter route for Texas ranchers to deliver their goods to the north and east. They began to use an old hunting and trading route through indigenous territory, that had been scouted by Jesse Chisholm, a Cherokee merchant, and his friend Black Beaver, a Lenape guide and trader. The trail, which became known as the Chisholm Trail, runs through what is now Highway 81. As the railroad grew, the trail changed shape, eventually ending at Caldwell, before being overtaken by newer, better routes.

In 1995, a group of volunteers worked together to memorialize this era in silhouetted steel. The trail is best viewed at dawn, as the sun breaks over the trail, or at dusk, as the trail figures seemingly come to life as they face the waning light.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had conversations with Nora Eisner (Flatiron) and Abby Shaum (CUNY) today about how we report the significance of a signal we find in a time series. In particular a periodic signal. It's an old, unsolved problem, with a lot of literature. And various hacks that are popular in the exoplanet community (and binary-star community!). My position is very simple: Since all methods for determining significance are flawed, and since when you fit a signal you have to estimate also an uncertainty on that signal's parameters, the simplest and most basic test of significance is the significance with which you measure the  of the proposed signal. That is, if the amplitude is well measured, the signal is real. Of course there are adversarial data sets I can make where this isn't true! But that's just a restatement of the point that this is an unsolved problem. For deep reasons!amplitude]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asakusa is one of Tokyo’s most popular tourist destinations, known for the iconic Sensō-ji Temple complex and a network of quaint shopping streets leading up to it. Historically, it was also the center of pre-war cultural modernization, home to many of Japan’s firsts, such as the bar, cinema, amusement park and more.

Underneath this bustling district, only a staircase away from the throng of tourists, hides the oldest surviving subterranean shopping street in Japan: the Asakusa Underground Street.

Established in 1955, the Underground Street is connected to the Asakusa metro station, which itself is part of the oldest subway in Asia. From the ground level, on the other hand, the entrances to the Underground Street are rather inconspicuous and hardly noticeable unless you know where to f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s no secret that Mississippi is currently America’s poorest state, but that doesn’t mean local residents are just sitting around waiting for their cities to crumble. As downtown Yazoo City struggled with rising vacancy rates and a difficult business environment, local business owners on Main Street banded together and began to fight back with a bold strategy: cans of brightly colored pastel paint.

Most of the downtown buildings in Yazoo City date back to the same year: 1904. That was the year a fire ripped through Yazoo City, burning down most of the buildings and forcing it to rebuild. A local legend claims this was the work of “The Witch of Yazoo,” who cursed the town after drowning in quicksand. Others may claim poor fire codes.

These historic buildings fell into a general state of disrepair until the early 2000s, when members of the Yazoo County CVB convinced remaining business owners to paint downtown in various vibrant colors designed to give the town a Caribbean look, or maybe that of a gaudier version of Charleston’s Rainbow Row. 

The block is anchored by the historic Main Street Hotel, and its event space, “The No Smoking Smoke House.” From November through early January, Christmas lights are hung on the buildings, lending the town an even more vibrant and colorful pageantry. Main Street still has its share of vacant storefronts, but the town has seen a revival both from the renewed vigor of town, and from tourists attracted by its photogenic exterior.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1960s, Italy was crossed by an economic boom. The paper businessman Luigi Burgo wanted a new factory to host a new, huge, paper machine. The factory needed to be able to expand as business increased. This was a great problem, he needed a 250-meter-long room with a 160-meter-long wall without a pillar (to allow the possible expansion).

Burgo called Pier Luigi Nervi to solve the problem. Nervi was an Italian architect who specialized in the Brutalist style. At that time he already built many stadiums, bridges, spot halls and the UNESCO headquarters in Italy. Nervi was in love with the architectural potential of enforced concrete and was already known as the "poet" or the "tailor" of enforced concrete.

Nervi decided to approach the challenge in a completely different way, building a bridge-like structure instead of a normal factory building. He built two sets of piers to hold up metal chains that allow the ceiling to "float" over the structure without pillars, but with walls made only of metal and glass.

Burgo's new paper mill became an iconic structure. It was in use until 2013 when the all company shut down due to low newspaper sales. The factory was used again starting in 2015 after it was taken over by another company.]]></summary>

Maharaja Duleep Singh was born in Lahore, in modern-day Pakistan, on September 6, 1838. His father Ranjit Singh was the first Sikh Maharaja of the Punjab and Sikh Empire, in modern-day eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. After his father’s death, a series of successors were killed. Finally, Duleep Singh was declared Maharaja at just five years old.

The British, through their agents in the East India Company, were quick to exploit the unstable situation in the Punjab and after two Anglo-Sikh wars, the Company took control of the region. The Maharaja, just 10 years old at the time, was forced to sign…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Buddhist temple of Ryūkōin was once in possession of a peculiar statue called Kateki. Also honorifically referred to as Kateki-Sonja or Kateki-Sama, it was believed to represent an ancient Chinese polymath, the inventor of sailing vessels who had lived during the reign of the Yellow Emperor.

The wooden statue became a boogeyman at some point, used by mothers to scare their children into good behavior. According to local legend, Kateki was actually the Adzuki-Baba, an old hag characterized by an eerie bean-grinding noise. It was said that Kateki would transform into a badger at night and carry off naughty children into the dark, presumably to feast on them. Children were unimpressed by the stories, however; it is said that they would come barging into the temple and use the statue as a mere plaything.

It was not until 1924 that the true identity of the Kateki statue was finally revealed. It was photographed and introduced to the world at the Vatican expo, garnering attention from historians, who recognized its Erasmian attributes. It was, in fact, a statue of the Dutch theologian and philosopher Desiderius Erasmus—but its historic value was simply underestimated.

As it turned out, the Erasmus statue had once served as the stern figurehead of the De Liefde, originally named the Erasmus, an East Indiaman that set sail from Rotterdam in 1598. Winding up ashore in Bungo Province (today Oita Prefecture), the ship brought some of the first Europeans to reach Japan, including Jan Joosten and William Adams. She was wrecked and lost in time, leaving only the Erasmus statue to survive and somehow end up at Ryūkōin Temple.

When news broke, the Netherlands offered to purchase the statue, but the Japanese government declined and designated it as a National Treasure. While the temple retains ownership over it, it has been loaned to the Tokyo National Museum, where it goes on display from time to time. A replica of it is permanently exhibited at the Sano City Museum, as well as at the Maritime Museum in Rotterdam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When settlers first reached the Wyoming Territory, they would often use natural features as lines of demarcation. In what would one day become Campbell County, the first settlers used a rockpile to stake their claim on the land. This settlement became known as Rocky Pile, but when the Burlington & Missouri Railroad arrived in 1891, the town was renamed Gillette after one of their surveyors.

The rockpile continued to be a sedimentary symbol of the town’s fortunes, visible from Highway 16 as Gillette grew and became a mining mecca. Residents were torn between leveling the ground for its continued development and preserving it as part of the town’s legacy. Finally, in 1970, Ralph A. Kintz bought the land and donated it to Campbell County. Four years later, the Campbell County Rockpile Museum opened.

In addition to preserving the rockpile, the museum interprets the history of the Powder River Basin. It contains exhibits on paleontology and geology, as well as firearms, saddles, and spurs from the town’s ranching and cowboy days. Particular interest is paid to Gillette’s heritage of coal mining. At its peak, the Powder River basin provided more than 35 percent of the energy for the entire nation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Constructed in 1850, this 72-foot-long, Ithiel Town wooden lattice truss bridge is one of the last two that remain among the 13 that once crisscrossed Red Clay Creek in Delaware.

The Wilmington and Western Railroad once included a station near the bridge and the area became a very popular picnic spot for train passengers. The railroad still runs alongside Red Clay Creek and carries riders past Wooddale Bridge to this day.

Wooddale grew to become a village in the 1890s, but it survived for less than 20 years with people moving away after the last factory, a paper mill, burned down in 1918.

In 2003, the original Wooddale Bridge was destroyed by flooding related to Tropical Storm Henri. Between 2007-2008, the Delaware Department of Transportation undertook a multimillion-dollar effort to restore the bridge. This included raising the roadway five feet and using highly durable Bongossi wood to better fortify the span.

The bridge was re-opened on December 15, 2008, and has been standing strong ever since.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1953, a shoe salesman named Albert J. King, still mourning the loss of his nephew, John Cooper, during World War II, had a proposal for the city of Emporia, Kansas. Why not adapt Armistice Day, a holiday established to honor World War I veterans, into a holiday for all veterans? Through that idea, Veterans Day came to Emporia, and soon after to the entire United States as well.

Emporia first celebrated Veterans Day on November 11, 1953. The next year, U.S. Representative Ed Rees, also from Emporia, brought a bill to Congress changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day. U.S. President and fellow Kansan Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954, and the first national Veterans Day was celebrated later that year.

As with much history, this narrative is somewhat complicated by reality. In particular, Birmingham, Alabama, also has a strong claim on Veterans Day, due to the efforts of World War II veteran Raymond Weeks to establish a Veterans Day in 1947. To share credit, Birmingham was named the “first city of Veterans Day” by the Senate, while Emporia was proclaimed the “Founding City of Veterans Day” by the House. Veterans Day, much like success, has many fathers.

On May 26, 1991,  to cement Emporia’s legacy as the home of Veterans Day, a park was opened to honor U.S. veterans of all wars. Displays at the memorial include a World War II M-4A6 Sherman army tank, and a Huey helicopter from the Vietnam War. Tablets of Honor recognize individual veterans through donated plaques. Each year in November, the town observes All Veterans Tribute Week in recognition of all veterans and Emporia's history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Namdaemun is one of eight gates built into the Fortress Wall, a Joseon Dynasty fortification that surrounded and protected the city of Seoul.

Namdaemun (남대문) means "South Great Door" but the gate is officially known as Sungnyemun (숭례문) "Honouring Propriety Door."An interesting side note is that it is a common but false belief among many Koreans that the name Namdaemun was imposed by the Japanese, and therefore many feel that it should not be used.  The truth is that Joseon dynasty records show naming gates after their respective direction was actually in use before the Japanese invaded. 

The gate dates back to the 14th century, and is constructed in a historic pagoda-style gateway design. It was first built at the end of King Taejo's reign, in 1398, and was then rebuilt in 1447.

While he strolled along his quiet, residential neighborhood at the edge of the city center, a green door of a Victorian building caught his eye.

The door was grubby, graffitied, and clearly very old, likely built sometime (like so much of Edinburgh) in the early 19th century. “But what was this door’s story?” Mogg wondered. What kind of lives might it have witnessed?

Right there, in front of the eye-catching doorway, Mogg searched the address in the British Newspaper Archive on his phone. Within seconds, he was skimming through stories of past residents. In 1888, a window cleaner had fallen off the building and died. In 1896, a resident died of gangrene after a heavy…]]></summary>

Overlooking a snaking waterway of tangled emerald mangroves and silver-flanked snapper stood a lone interpretive sign.

“Many legends talk of a pirate named ‘Black Caesar,’ who was reputed to have stalked the water and keys of Biscayne Bay during the 1700s,” the sign states. “Some of these stories claim that Black Caesar left tons of silver somewhere in what is now Biscayne National Park.”

Three decades ago, psychologists identified the “women-are-wonderful effect,” based on research showing that both […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australians are not known for building grand family mausoleums or enormous burial monuments that are often found in other countries. Rather it is far more common for people to have a stone, sometimes on older graves an obelisk or an angel, or perhaps to have the grave paved over with tile and an iron fence (although most of the iron fences were removed long ago, for a variety of reasons). These days, most modern cemeteries simply encourage the use of a metal plaque on a concrete block to facilitate mowing the lawns. But this building is something else. It is large, topped with an urn made of concrete, and with walls of stained glass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Entering Cut Bank, Montana, it's hard to miss the sign announcing that you've entered the coldest town in America. Because that sign takes the form of a giant concrete penguin.

The big bird was created by Cut Bank resident Ron Gustafson more than 30 years ago. "It was on one of those flash-frozen days, February 1, 1989," according to Roadside America, "when the wind chill plummeted to 64 degrees below zero" and Gustafson decided he should commemorate the town's claim to fame. The 27-foot-tall penguin stood outside of his family's appliance store.

The base of the statue proclaims Cut Bank "the coldest spot in the nation," but is that actually true? In the winter, the temperature rarely gets above freezing. The coldest temperature in the town's history was -47 degrees Fahrenheit, which happened on February 15, 1936. (The record for lowest temperature in the United States comes from Prospect Creek, Alaska, which hit -80 degrees Fahrenheit on January 23, 1971.)]]></summary>

As with most great works of art, “Home on the Range” was originally drafted by an otolaryngologist. Dr. Brewster M. Higley VI had moved from Indiana to a cabin on the banks of West Beaver Creek. Inspired by the natural beauty of his new surroundings, he wrote a poem he titled “My Western Home.” While Dr. Higley was operating on a man with a gunshot wound, a friend of the patient read the poem and said he should publish it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s widely known that Walt Disney had a secret apartment on the second floor of Disneyland Fire Department, which overlooks the entire park. It was his favorite spot, and he would light the lamp by the window whenever he came up here, signaling to cast members that the man himself was at work.

Curiously, it is said that the lamp kept turning itself on after Walt's death in 1966, which developed into an urban legend before long. Some believe that it contains his spirit and that he is always watching the guests enjoy his masterpiece that will never be completed, an ever-growing kingdom of dreams.

Though a variant of the legend claims that the lamp has never been turned off since the supernatural incident, it is not quite true, of course, and avid park-goers and Disney historians have noted that the current lamp, as well as the one before it, is a replacement and not the original Walt Disney lamp. Casual guests, on the other hand, may not even know how significant this fire department building is in the first place.

The legendary apartment is not open to the public, and you can only see the lamp from ground level. On special occasions, however, Disneyland Park offers guided tours which include a visit to the upper apartment, a rare opportunity to meet Walt Disney's ghost face to face.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The subtleties of women have long baffled men. Take anthropologist William Webb. In the 1940s, he was briefly perplexed to find hunting tools in the ancient graves of women. Webb, then head of the department of archaeology and anthropology at the University of Kentucky, was investigating the Indian Knoll site, from the Late Archaic Period (5,000 to 3,000 years ago). He concluded that the hunting gear—in this case an atlatl, or spear-thrower—must have been placed there by husbands, or because they made pretty hair ornaments.

“It is hardly to be supposed that ... women would have any practical use in life for an atlatl … such occurrences represent true burial offerings to the dead of artifacts primarily intended for the use of men,” Webb wrote in 1946.

"Three halls," he says in a modest way. Once inside you'll turn around and realize your head contains too few eyes to absorb the place in one look. It's beautifully stuffed, arranged by themes and one can see how many years of collecting have gone into this. Past these three halls, the museum expands outside when you go around the corner only to let your jaw drop once again by realizing the museum doubles or even triples size here, just as packed with finds and treasures by Manuel as all the other halls.

Open since 1977, the Musée chez Manuel displays all the finds of this tireless traveler-collector in over 2,000 square meters of exhibition space. Manuel Ribeiro, founder of the museum: “I crossed France as a traveling salesman. One day a farmer gave me a trolley lamp. And I caught the collecting virus.”

On the flyer of the museum (also called Musee d'Art Populaire) it says it shows automobiles, bicycles, motorcycles, pedal cars, old toys and unusual objects. That last term fits best, for this museum is filled with passion and dedication, leaning towards obsession in the best way possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Souto da Retorta, also known as the Chavín Eucalyptus Forest, near the town of Viveiro in Galicia, there are some of the tallest eucalyptus trees on the continent. The largest and most outstanding among them is O Avó ("grandfather" in Galician). A tree of the species Eucalyptus globulus was planted here in 1880 in order to drain the lowlands flooded by the streams of the river Landro.

The eucalyptus arrived in Europe in the 19th century, specifically in northwestern Spain, when a Galician priest brought its seeds from the distant Australian lands where he had been a missionary.  Optimally adapted to the conditions of the humid oceanic climate and spread massively throughout northern Spain where, due to its rapid growth, it has been cultivated to obtain wood and paper.

These eucalyptus plants were the first planted here, and O Avó is the oldest of them, being the biggest tree in Spain, standing more than 67 meters (220 feet) tall.  (There is controversy due to the height of one of the eucalyptus trees that surround it with which it has a close height of a few feet difference) Furthermore it would be the tallest eucalyptus in Europe. 

A perimeter fence has been installed to protect O Avó, since due to its age, it is affected by various diseases and also to avoid compaction of the ground in its surroundings that could affect its growth.

In 2010, O Avó was elected Tree of the Year by Bosques sin Fronteras (Forests Without Borders).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kitaichi Glass is one of the most popular brands based in Otaru, established in 1901 as a manufacturer of petrol lamps and trawler floats. As Otaru developed into a major tourist destination over the years, it shifted to producing tableware, ornaments, wind chimes, and the like, branching into a total of 17 locations within the city.

On the bustling Sakaimachi-Dori shopping street stands the Sangokan ("Building No. 3"), a historic building constructed in 1891 as a fishery warehouse where local herrings were processed and canned. Trolley tracks from those bygone days, which connected the warehouse to the harbor, are also well preserved, allowing visitors to walk over as an atmospheric corridor.

Today, the former warehouse is home to an outlet of Kitaichi Glass, three floors full of stunning glassware, as well as a café called the Kitaichi Hall.

Simply put, the Kitaichi Hall is nothing short of magnificence, with a lofty ceiling and wooden beams. Its only source of lighting is 167 petroleum lamps, a few on each table and some on the chandeliers above, giving a warm, nostalgic, dreamlike feel to the place. Along the wall sits a Steinway grand piano, where live performances are held daily from Tuesday to Friday (except national holidays) at 2:00, 3:00, and 4:00 PM.

Full of local fare, the menu is well worth a mention, of course. The whipped ice cream and royal milk tea are made from the famous Hokkaido milk, and the parfait is made from haskap, the blue honeysuckle native to Hokkaido. During the lunch hours between 11:00 AM and 2:50 PM, you can also order rice bowls and noodles featuring Hokkaido's signature seafood: crab, salmon, and salmon roe. There's a nice selection of Otaru's craft beer, too.

The petroleum lamps are lit by human hands every morning at 8:45, allowing early visitors to watch the operation before opening for the day at 9:00.]]></summary>

His father, Eloy Alfaro, who founded the factory in 1923 in Sarchí, Costa Rica, asked his son which craft he wanted to learn to help construct the carts. Out of woodworking, blacksmithing, and mechanics, the young Castro chose mechanics—and 70 years later, he is still diligently constructing oxcarts in the tiny town of Sarchí, masterfully crafting each part by hand with the help of his associates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep in a wooded area near the University town of Lampeter, West Wales is an outdoor theatre. Around it, hidden in the woodland are figures of angels and wood spirits carved from the trees. In front of the stage are tiered seats that have been fashioned from the hilly natural slope of the wood.

To the right of the slowly decaying stage next to a poem written in the Welsh language is a poem by Dylan Thomas, Wales's most famous poet. His poem 'Do not go gentle into that good night' was written by Thomas in the knowledge of the death of his father. This is perhaps a fitting tribute to the theatre itself. Parts of the wooden stage have collapsed and other areas are beginning to rot away. It appears to have been some time since a performance was staged at this magical location.

Longwood Woodland Theatre started out as part of a community initiative in 2003. An area of woodland was purchased and run as a social enterprise. It became Wales's first sustainable community woodland. Built as a zero-carbon project, it was constructed using timber from the local forest without cement or concrete. Two hundred volunteers took part in the enterprise from local rural communities where social exclusion can be a challenge to young people. One of the aims of the project was to restore non-native plantations to native broadleaf species. Since 2007, 10,000 trees have been planted.

There is limited information concerning how many plays or musicals were staged at the theatre, but it may have fallen into disuse during the Covid pandemic in 2020 where social distancing laws prevented any outdoor gatherings from taking place. Nature has now started to reclaim these spaces. Songs and performances are now only by birds such as Goldcrest and the rare Wood Warblers that nest here.]]></summary>

In Russian, yoshkin-kot (literally “Yoshkin cat”) is a humorous phrase uttered in surprise or mild shock, perhaps similar to the “holy cow” in English. One theory suggests that it may refer to Bayun, a magical cat in Russian fairytales, who often assists the witch Baba Yaga.

However, it is not known what yoshkin (or sometimes ezhkin) really means anymore—perhaps a corruption of some earlier word. But one thing is thought to be clear: that it has nothing to do with Yoshkar-Ola, despite the similarity of the sounds.

Still, the Cat of Yoshkar-Ola keeps on smirking smugly, regardless of his relevance.]]></summary>

But when a chilly summer breeze sweeps through in July, or when unexpected rains dampen our winter holidays, the age-old debate resurfaces: “Is climate change even real?” If you want to dive deep into the fascinating realm of chaotic ...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the early 20th century, Sir Hubert Miller was the Lord of the Manor in the picturesque Hampshire village of Froyle. The Miller family had been a prominent presence in the community for over a century, funding church repairs and the construction of a village school.

Miller was a man of deep faith and often traveled to his villa in Venice, Italy. During his travels, he acquired an impressive collection of religious icons and saintly statues, which he brought back to Froyle and installed in the village's church. Over time, his collection grew larger, and he began placing these beautiful sculptures around the village too, adorning Upper Froyle with 19 unique and highly detailed figures.

Thanks to Miller's passion for collecting, Froyle was christened "The Village of Saints." To this day, the thatched cottages and redbrick houses of Upper Froyle continue to display these fantastic figures. One of the most charming homes in Froyle is Post Office Cottage, which features a statue of Saint Hubert, the patron saint of hunting, for whom Sir Hubert is the namesake.

Whether you're a history buff, a lover of art, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of charming villages, Froyle and its fascinating collection of saints are sure to capture your heart.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Housed within the collections of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Missouri's Museum Support Center is a peculiar artifact, and one of the newest in comparison with the other 2 million artifacts in the museum's collections. A 1975 Ford Econoline van named Ghost Dancing sits idle, decades after taking the journey recounted in the book Blue Highways: A Journey into America. 

The van was named after the Ghost Dance, first practiced by the Nevada Northern Paiute tribe as a way to ward off American Western Expansion. Author William Trogden published Blue Highways under the name William Least-Heat Moon, harkening to his father's indigenous roots that he used as a guiding principle for his journey.

William Least-Heat Moon got divorced, lost his job as a professor at Stephen's College in Columbia, and in 1978 set off on a three-month journey in a circle around the United States to connect with people in small towns such as Why, Arizona, and Whynot, Mississippi. Decades before the #VanLife trend, Least-Heat Moon lived in Ghost Dancing, following the 'blue highways' on his Rand McNally atlas to direct him toward the paths less traveled. 

"When you're traveling, you are what you are right there and then," he wrote. "People don't have your past to hold against you. No yesterdays on the road.” 

In the Museum Support Center's collections, you can also visit the Grayson Archery Collection—the world's most extensive collection of historical bows and arrows. From six continents, the Grayson collection catalogs the history of archery through indigenous history, various types of mechanical advancements through the ages, and world record-holding bows.]]></summary>

Bangalore is a mid-sized city that saw a very big expansion in the past few years due to having become a center for the information technology in the country - with most of the big multinationals opening sections there. The rapid expansion increased the wealth of the middle class there (but remember, the middle class is the top 5% in India), but it also created stress to the traffic in the city, which is notoriously a plague there.The campus of ICTS is very nice from an architectonic point of view, embedding nature in its buildings and trying to integrate the two realities.

The unit vectors have gradients because, in a curvilinear coordinate system, they have orientations that depend on position.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can take a warp pipe back to your childhood in Fargo, North Dakota, where two artists have collaborated on a mural of one of the most famous scenes in video game history. The artists call this interactive art project the "Fargo Mario Wall," while others may consider it Instagram bait for elder millennials.

Although now a popular tourist attraction, the "Fargo Mario Wall" began life as a semi-guerrilla street art project by an artist couple who went by the handles “Dark Elvis” and “Icky Hiccup.” After an earlier mural project was covered up, the artists were convinced that they had to find a wall for their idea for a mural based upon World 1-1 in Super Mario Bros., and they connected with a Fargo-based community building organization, Folkways to complete the mural in 2018.

The mural consists of the beginning scene of World 1-1, where Mario encounters his first enemy, the Goomba, perhaps the single most-defeated enemy in video game history. Mario is missing from the work, to allow passersby to complete the image themselves. The interactive display allows visitors to choose to either stomp the Goomba, raise their fists to hit the power-up for a mushroom, or both.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally established in 598 CE, the Raiden Shrine in the Gunma town of Itakura is known as Japan’s main center of thunder worship, and for centuries, people have prayed to the gods of thunder here for protection from natural disasters.

While the shrine itself is an impressive sight, with the current building dating back to 1835, it is also home to a hidden gem lying in an annex building just across the road.

Namazu-San is a sleek brass sculpture of a catfish with a slight smile, comfortably placed on a long cushion. Guarding him is a group of red demons representing thunder. In Japanese folklore, the giant subterrestrial catfish is considered to be the cause of earthquakes, often subdued by another god of thunder. Since the Middle Ages, this association has been common knowledge and reflected everywhere in Japanese culture, from traffic signs to Pokémon.

The brazen catfish of Raiden Shrine is not only worshipped for protection against earthquakes, but also for his confidence-boosting mojo. The unattended shrine lets visitors take a handkerchief for a donation of 300 yen and wipe Namazu-San with it, rubbing off his charm so that they can take it home for good luck.

The unusual belief and practice derive from a simple wordplay, something Japanese culture traditionally appreciates. To put it simply, “earthquake” and “confidence” are homophonous in Japanese, written as 地震 and 自信 respectively but both read jishin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Half a mile east of Rosehearty, a ruined castle sits on the slopes of a hill overlooking a sandy bay. Pitsligo Castle was originally designed as a keep dating to 1424. It was then modified in the 1570s by the Forbes of Druminnor. Despite not having a particularly strong or strategically important location, Pitsligo Castle overlooked the shipping route along the Moray Firth coast.

Scottish historian W. Douglas Simpson described Pitsligo Castle as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, a term used to refer to the rocky headland of northeast Aberdeenshire.

The castle has an arched gateway in the outer courtyard's west wall, which is marked both with the date 1656 and the coats of arms of both the Forbes and the Eskine families. In the inner court, however, the date is shown as 1663. Several armorial plaques can be found on other inner walls, including the Pitsligo Arms of 1665 and the Royal Arms dated 1577 and 1603.

There is a tall flanking drum tower in the northeast corner of the courtyard. Pitsligo Castle's main tower had three vaulted stories, but since its abandonment nearly everything above the lowest level has disappeared.

The Forbes family made the mistake of supporting the Jacobite cause, and in 1745 their estate forfeited to the crown. Flemish troops led by William Lascelles, looted and destroyed Pitsligo Castle in 1845. Eventually, the roof was removed and the castle fell into ruin.

At some point, it appears that restoration work was begun on the castle. Some of the fallen masonry has been collected into large piles of rubble that litter the inner courtyard. Work currently appears halted.]]></summary>

As a child, he would help his parents, Frank and Minnie, manage their 160-acre farm. However, by the time Walter was 13, his parents had to sell the farm due to ongoing drought, and Walter moved into Humboldt, where he attended school. 

Walter Johnson moved with his family to Southern California in 1902, where he began to pick up the game of baseball. An athletic child, he picked the game up quickly, becoming something of a phenom who began to garner attention, first from local and regional semipro teams, and eventually, by 1907, the Washington Senators.

“Truly thou art damned: like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.”

William Shakespeare’s witty fool Touchstone lets this zinger fly in As You Like It, and the food historian senses a challenge. The art of egg-roasting may now be as bygone as an eglantine or a bodkin, but what can be learned of the history and fate of the technique? Furthermore, in defining for us an ill-roasted egg, Touchstone not only proposes a history question, but presents a cooking challenge—to well-roast an egg, evenly, and to taste.

Because of its resemblance to the Pink Panther, a beloved cartoon character that debuted in the 1960s, the fountain is known as "La Pantera Rosa." It changed color from its original pinkish red to pink, only to be painted back to its original red hue.

Having led to criticisms for its controversial look and placement in the city, it is a must-visit for its rather strange connection to the cartoon character. Many locals can agree that it looks rather odd, leading to the idea behind its creation often being missed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you know one thing about 12th-century Arab cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, it is that he is the author of this wonky world map, which is often included in modern atlases as a prime example of medieval mapmaking skills.

That invites comparisons that do him no favors. Among the hyper-precise maps in today’s atlases, al-Idrisi’s looks like a child’s drawing. His Europe is sketchy, his Asia amorphous, and his Africa manages to be both partial and oversized. Plus, the map is a planisphere—the projection of a sphere onto a flat (and typically circular) plane—which creates the mistaken impression that al-Idrisi was a flat-Earther of the Discworld variety.


And that’s not all that’s wrong with this map. For starters, you’re seeing it upside-down. As did most Arab maps of that time, this o…]]></summary>

Kim Dae-Seong, a Prime Minister of the Silla Dynasty initiated and supervised the construction of both a temple and a grotto at Mount Toham. It is said that he had the temple built in memory of his parents in his present life, and the grotto in memory of his parents from a previous life.

Work was completed on the grotto in 774, shortly after Kim's death. Due to the small size of the grotto it is thought that it was probably used exclusively by the Silla royalty who took over its construction after Kim passed away.

The tradition of carving images of Buddha from stone into cliff walls and natural caves began in India. …]]></summary>

The Republic of Cows

by Jude Isabella, Hakai Magazine

Chirikof, a remote island off the coast of Alaska, is about the size of two Manhattans—and home to more than 2,000 cows. Depending on whom you ask, writes Jude Isabella, the cattle are either unwelcome invasive megafauna or rightful heirs of a place they have inhabited for at least 200 years. Whether they stay or go will probably come down to human emotion, rather than historical or ecological evidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The “Mother Road” that helped define America’s love affair with the road trip is now decommissioned, but key parts of historic U.S. Highway 66 remain, and aficionados still trace the route from its origin near the shore of Lake Michigan in Chicago to its unofficial terminus in Santa Monica, California. And though it’s always been understood as a journey heading west, it does go both ways, both beginning and ending in Chicago on the Midwest Coast.

U.S. Highway 66 was officially created by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads in 1926 as one of the highways that would make up the network of America’s first Federal highway interstate system. The new system redesignated existing roads in many areas to piece together a coordinated interstate system.

According to the Route 66 Association of Illinois, Route 66 began in Chicago in 1926 at the intersection of Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue. This initial portion of the highway was renamed Illinois State 4, which ran from Chicago to East St. Louis. With this pre-existing state highway, the Illinois portion of Route 66 was the first to be completely paved and was also the first to replace the existing road with the U.S. highway. In the mid-1950s, the starting point of Route 66 was moved over a block due to a change in Chicago traffic patterns that made Jackson Drive a one-way street.

Today, Historic Route 66 begins in front of the Art Institute of Chicago, with a sign on the south side of the street that is almost completely covered in stickers. It ends where it originally began at East Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue with a sign on Jackson Boulevard that is less covered in stickers and much more easily identifiable.

As exemplified in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, the route is about more than transportation, it’s about people, their stories, and our collective history.]]></summary>

This unassuming grave has become a beacon of hope, drawing hundreds of pilgrims each week, all in search of the miraculous healing powers believed to emanate from the rainwater collected on its surface.

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/edins-hall-broch-scotland"/>
        <updated>2023-09-01T16:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A broch is a uniquely Scottish Iron Age form of roundhouse fortification usually found in the northern part of the country. There are over 500 brochs in Scotland, mostly distributed between northern and western Scotland and the islands, with only a small handful in the Scottish Lowlands. Edin's Hall Broch sits as part of a very unusual complex.

The hill fort that surrounds the broch predates the broch by about 2,000 to 2,500 years. The broch itself is thought to date back to some time between 0-200 A.D. It has double ramparts which enclose an oval area measuring 135 meters by 75 meters. The ramparts are impressive, in places standing up to 4.5 meters in height.

Towards the center of the fort are the remains of a large roundhouse, which would likely have been the most important building in the enclosure prior to the construction of the broch.

The broch stands tucked away in one corner of the hill fort, within an oval enclosure of 58 meters by 54 meters that separates it from the rest of the site. What remains of the thick stone wall hints at its impressive size. A narrow entrance passageway to the west side would have been guarded by two chambers set back in the wall on either side of the doorway.

The walls themselves also held chambers, three of them in almost dumbbell shape. They were sturdy enough to support staircases that rose up between the walls to provide access to the wallhead.

What makes Edin's Hall so unusual is its massive size. At 28 meters in diameter to the outer wall, it stands much larger than most Highland broch. Some have suggested that it would not have stood as tall as other brochs because of its diameter, but there is evidence that the walls originally stood to twice their current height at around two meters.  There are also suggestions that it possibly was not covered in the same way as other brochs, making it more like a substantial Iron Age roundhouse than a traditional broch.]]></summary>

The founder of a successful bank and a longtime resident of Florence, Artusi was a wealthy bachelor who devoted his retirement to his interests. These included analyzing poetry, attending university lectures, and collecting recipes to be tested by his household cook and Sabatini, his housekeeper (Artusi was menu-planner and taster, but did little cooking himself).

Friends encouraged Artusi to publish his recipe collection. In 1891, when he was 71 years old, Artusi collected his recipes into a book, Scienza in cucina e l’arte di mangiar bene (Science in the Kitchen and …]]></summary>

In 1940-1941, there were a number of modifications and alterations done to the building, including a new roof and updated iron-clad cells.

The jail was closed by Governor Lester Maddox and was eventually auctioned off to the Liberty County Housing Authority. After that, the building was donated to the city of Hinesville, where they have been holding exhibits for local artists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This area of the Insurgentes Mixcoac colonia (neighborhood) of Mexico City, could well be called "Little Spain." Not necessarily because of a large migrant community from the European country, but rather just because of its street names. Málaga, Santander, Cádiz, and others can be found here, although Seville does not get a street and is instead the namesake of the Plaza Sevilla, a small roundabout with a peculiar monument at its center.

The Fuente de Sevilla (Seville Fountain) was built here in the 1920s, with a design from architect Leonardo Noriega and engineer Javier Stávoli. Noriega and Stávoli are probably best known for the Parque México, one of the city's main parks. Parque México is located in the Condesa colonia, noted for its Art Deco and Art Nouveau architecture, dating to the 1920s and 30s.

Plaza Sevilla's fountain follows the same trends, with an almost pyramidal geometric design, decorated with undulating corners and stained glass on all four sides. Near the top, paintings of the Sun and Moon complete the design. The fountain basin is carved in stone, and the designers' names are found on a plaque here.

By the 1970s, the fountain stood forgotten, and for almost 50 years it was vandalized and deteriorated (even losing an original clock). Its renovation was finished in 2020, and since then, it has stood as a small yet significant century-old heritage.]]></summary>

It's here that the Ganges River comes down from the foothills of the Himalayas and enters the plains of eastern India. At this auspicious location, Hindu pilgrims come to bathe in the river and give offerings. Ceremonies and festivals often take place here as well.

Every evening the Ganga Aarti ceremony can be seen at sunset where a fire offering is made to the river goddess,  the Goddess Ganga or Maa Ganga. Various Hindu festivals often take place here, the largest of which is the Kumbh Mela. Every 12 years thousands of pilgrims descend on Haridwar for the Kumbh Mela and crowd into Har Ki Pauri. The next Haridwar Kumbh Mela will take place in 2033.]]></summary>

In this episode of The Atlas Obscura Podcast, we transports listeners to the gorgeous coastal waters of Maine as we set sail aboard the Lewis R. French—the oldest commercial sailing vessel in the US and a National Historic Landmark.

Join host Dylan Thuras as he learns about windjammers from Captain Becky Wright, who just took the helm of the Lewis R. French in 2022. Originally built as a freight schooner and launched in April, 1871, the Lewis R. French was rebuilt for the passenger trade in the 1970s and has had a second life taking travelers on multi day adventures up and down the coast of Maine.

We’ll hear about Captain Becky’s background and how her father’s love of maritime fiction inspired her to pursue a career that seemed impossible until she learned about the windjammers in Maine. Her stories and experiences will illuminate why cruising on a windjammer is the ideal way to experience Maine...and we’ll find out why Maine is one of the only places in the world where visitors can still have these authentic nautical experiences.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays the sleepy Queensland town of Muttaburra is best known for the discovery of the towering dinosaur known as the Muttaburrasaurus. But it also boasts a number of other unusual finds, including the A.A. Cassimitis General Store Museum. 

The Cassimitis General Store Museum is a general store originally founded in 1918 that appears to have been later abandoned and preserved in time, with stocks of hardware, automotive supplies, crockery, and farm machinery all still on display.

In 1911, Andrew Andrew (A.A.) Cassimatis and his son George left their home on a Greek island to build a new life in Australia. After some time in Sydney, the father-son duo moved north and then west, finally landing in Muttaburra. A.A. and George built a general store in the town in 1918. The small store sold everything from groceries and hardware to automotive supplies. Eventually the Cassimatises expanded into other businesses: icemaking, soft drinks, agriculture, and more. 

The store closed not long after A.A. Cassimatis died in 1942. The building became a bank for a time, but in the 1990s, the Cassimatis General Store was restored as a museum celebrating the business that it once was.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-31T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The strikingly gorgeous stations of the Tashkent Metro may rival those in Moscow, even considered by some to be the most beautiful in the world. But they remain largely obscure because photography inside the metro was not only strictly forbidden, but illegal until June 2018.

Established in 1977, the Tashkent Metro is the oldest subway in Central Asia and seventh of the 13 metro systems in the former Soviet Union. It consists of four lines serving 48 stations, each of which is designed after a particular theme. The whole metro was originally planned to be a city-wide nuclear shelter, and the Uzbek government classified it as a military facility, which was the reason behind its decades-long ban on photography. 

The metro is home to a hidden underground world of arches and chandeliers, marble columns, and mosque-like vaults. The styles range from classical to retro-futuristic, a legacy of Soviet architecture. Many of the stations are decorated with murals depicting scenes of historic interest, from a wall of blue and yellow mosaic tiles to ceramic reliefs inspired by the poetry of Ali-Shir Nava'i.

One of the most notable stations is Kosmonavtlar ("Cosmonauts"), which is themed after space exploration. The architectural designs are inspired by the Milky Way, with specks of glass "stars" sparkling through the colonnade. Throughout the station, there are blue ceramic murals of space-related figures such as Ulugh Beg, Valentina Tereshkova, Yuri Gagarin, and even Icarus. The Alisher Navoiy station, on the other hand, leans more towards Islamic architecture, looking like a cyberpunk mosque.

The fourth line of the Tashkent Metro, Circle Line, was only recently completed in 2020, along with the northern terminus of Yunusobod Line, Turkiston. It may not be as retro as the other stations, but it is meant to be a culmination of the metro's history—combining the distinct styles of Soviet and traditional Uzbek architecture, a modern masterpiece.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A disputed church in Priština, located on the campus of the University of Priština, has a complex history. Originally planned as part of an open-plan campus in the 1970s, it was later given to the Serbian Orthodox Church by the municipality, leading to tension and disputes.

Construction began in 1992, but was halted multiple times due to a lack of funds as well as a deteriorating security situation in Kosovo. At first, the church was not well-received by all due to being seen as a symbol of Serbian rule. After all, according to Spasoje Krunić's design, the church would have 1,389 golden crosses—a reference to the year of the Battle of Kosovo, which is particularly important to Serbian history, tradition, and national identity at large.

After the war in 1999, the building survived attempts of destruction and was placed under protection. The future of the church remains uncertain, with ownership still being disputed between the University of Priština and the Serbian Orthodox Church. Calls for demolition have led to vandalism and desecration.

The Eparchy of Raška and Prizren conducted a religious ceremony on the grounds in 2021, sparking criticism and protests. The church, therefore, remains a contentious symbol in Pristina. Originally intended to be a prominent religious structure, it now stands as an urban semi-ruin, protected by a barbed wire fence set up by KFOR soldiers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The design of the former College Life Insurance Company headquarters, or the Pyramids as they are commonly known, was the brainchild of the famed architect Kevin Roche. For Roche (who trained under Eero Saarinen and designed such celebrated buildings as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Ford Foundation Headquarters), the inspiration for the buildings was a piece of concrete he saw on the side of the road, which resembled a pyramid.

At the time, Roche was working on a design for the College Life Insurance Company in Indianapolis. He thought the pyramidal concrete was an appropriately functional shape for the then-thriving business, which wanted to incrementally add building capacity as the size of its personnel grew. Roche's initial vision was to add additional pyramids as more office space was needed, for a total of nine buildings. However, only three were built during the initial construction period in 1971.

The three buildings, collectively known as the Pyramids, are the most impressive structures on the 200-acre College Park development. Built in a slick brutalist style, each building is constructed of two gleaming blue exterior walls supported by reinforced concrete, which comprise the other two walls. Each pyramid is 11 stories tall, contains over 120,000 square footage, and is connected via a network of underground and aboveground passages. All three overlook a 25-acre lake.

Today, the Pyramids are owned by Indiana-based real estate development firm KennMarr and are currently undergoing renovation. Sightseers need not worry, though: the exterior aesthetics that make the Pyramids so iconic will remain intact.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perched high above the Sonoma Coast, about three miles north of Fort Ross, is a striking obelisk that might catch your eye. Known as the Madonna of Peace, it's hidden in a tiny state park (the second smallest in California) right behind the Timber Cove Resort. 

The sculpture (also called "Peace Obelisk" or "The Expanding Universe") is one of several in Northern California by Italian artist Beniamino "Benny" Bufano and is an example of his anti-war viewpoint. The sculpture is shaped roughly like a missile, and was created around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was the final of his "projectiles of peace," completed just months before the artist died in 1970.

His first sculpture in the series was a 34-foot-tall monument simply titled Peace. It debuted at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Bufano wanted to build another, larger projectile of peace. In the 1950s, he traveled to the Soviet Union and proposed the idea to Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin, who declined the artist's offer.

But when Bufano was commissioned to create a sculpture in Timber Cove in the 1960s, he took the opportunity to create a towering monument to peace. The obelisk was built out of donated materials: redwood, steel, fiberglass, and mosaic tile. It took about a year to build the 68-foot body of the sculpture, but when it came time to place the head on top they found it was too heavy. For years, the head sat next to the base of the incomplete statue. In 1969, a special crane was brought in to lift the head into its rightful place, but it was accidentally placed backward. In February 1970, a second face was installed on the statue. Bufano died just a few months later in August.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the exoplanet (and, before that, eclipsing-binary) communities, transit-timing variations are described in terms of a quantity called O−C (pronounced “oh minus sea”), which is the difference between the observed transit time and the “computed” transit time. Right now, Abby Shaum (CUNY) and I are using this terminology in our manuscript about phase variations in coherent pulsators with companions, at the behest of Keaton Bell (CUNY). Okay fine! But O−C has this terrible property, which is that the C part depends on the period or frequency you assume. You can completely change the appearance or morphology of an O−C plot just by slightly tweaking the period. And there is no true period of course! There is just whatever estimates you can make. Which are, in turn, affected by what you use to model the O−C. So it is absolutely awful in every way. Not a stable observable, people! Not even .identifiable]]></summary>

Fröccs (roughly pronounced “frurtch") is a wine and soda water drink (it's always soda water, never fizzy mineral water) that's a summertime rite of passage in Budapest's ruin bars, café patios, and on many an apartment balcony or roof terrace. (Many people even have soda water delivered to their homes, à la the milkman of yore.) 

Drinking fröccs is a codified business. When it comes to ordering your glass, you have to decide if you are a "Mayor" (Polgármester), "Railway Watchman’s Mother-in-Law" (Bakteranyós), or a "Landlord" (Háziúr), to name just a few variations. The names represent the ratio of wine to soda water, measured in deciliters. While orders like the Mayor and Landlord correspond to respective ratios of 6:4 and 4:1, t…]]></summary>

The entire observatory is built around the Großer Refraktor (Great Refractor), an enormous cannon-like telescope designed by Friedrich Simon Archenhold. Unlike most other telescopes at the time, this one was freely rotating and made as long as possible to get the sharpest images it could.

The telescope, which is nicknamed the Himmelskanone (German for "celestial cannon" or "sky cannon"), was built for the 1896 Berlin Trade Exhibition, an event where new and revolutionary technology would be showcased. Unfortunately, the project took more time and money than expected, so it was completed late and without a proper building around it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some believe that these ruins gave their name to the nearby pit village of Bearpark.  The belief is the name is a corruption of the French term "Beau Repaire" the name given to the Priory.

Beaurepaire Priory was originally built by the Prior of Durham in charge of the Priory and Convent of Durham, Bertram de Middleton, in 1258 to be a country seat and his home in his retirement. It was visited by royalty on numerous occasions between 1296 and 1335, with visits by Kings Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III.

Over the centuries the priory was expanded several times. It took on a role similar to that of nearby Finchale Priory and acted as a retreat for the monks of Durham. The retreat was popular because, at just three miles from Durham City, it allowed the monks to attend daily mass easily.

The priory was heavily damaged following the nearby Battle of Neville's Cross and subsequently rebuilt and repaired by Prior Fossour. It suffered further during the British Civil War when the Priory was largely destroyed by the attacking Scots, with large assaults in 1640 and again four years later.

The park surrounding the priory supplied it with wood, coal, and building materials. It was also used as a stud for the prior's horses.

Most of what is left of Beaurepaire ranges from ankle-high to waist-high ruined walls.  However, there are a few sections that tower over visitors and with imagination it is possible to conceive that this was a once magnificent building.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Buddhism, the Five Hundred Arhats are the most loyal of the Buddha’s disciples, who attended the religion's first council at Rājagṛha (modern Rajgir) right after the Buddha's final nirvana to compile his teachings into scriptures. Several Japanese and Chinese temples are home to statues of the Arhats, which are said to bring good luck to visitors.

One of Japan’s three most popular arhat temple is Kita-in in Kawagoe, a quaint city about an hour away from Tokyo. Its famed sculpture garden contains a total of 538 statues, including the Great Buddha, Amitabha, Ksitigarbha, and the Bodhisattvas.

They were sculpted in the late Edo period, from 1782 to 1825, at the suggestion of a local monk named Shijo. They have since stood in the temple garden, collecting layers of moss and lichen.

Interestingly, the sculptures are not all serious and hard-faced. There is an endearing sense of humor to many of the arhats at Kita-in Temple, a touch of human nature, something even relatable to us living two centuries ahead of them.

For example, one arhat can be seen reclining and taking up his neighbor's space, who appears to be (understandably) annoyed but keeping it cool. Another arhat lies resting his cheeks on his hands, in a manner perhaps resembling that of a teenage girl gossiping at a sleepover. While some meditate solemnly, some are laughing, crying, sneezing, and there is even a monk who is definitely picking his nose.

Each of the arhat statues is uniquely sculpted, making it a fun experience to explore the enclosure and enjoy the multi-faceted essence of Buddhist art.]]></summary>

It had a 30-foot tower, walls nine feet and nine inches thick, and housed three large cannons and one smaller one. A few years later casemates were added, and by 1870, the fort got a major makeover, inspired by the threat of Napoleon III. A new battery was added, able to hold up to 175 soldiers and five officers. Most of the fort’s useful life was spent undergoing upgrades, and it only really saw active use during World War I. In 1929 it was finally …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing that physics and mechanical engineering students learn early on is that there are often analogies between charge flow and heat flow, and this is reflected in the mathematical models we use to describe charge and heat transport.  We use Ohm's law, \(\mathbf{j}=\tilde{\sigma}\cdot \mathbf{E}\), which defines an electrical conductivity tensor \(\tilde{\sigma}\) that relates charge current density \(\mathbf{j}\) to electric fields \(\mathbf{E}=-\nabla \phi\), where \(\phi(\mathbf{r})\) is the electric potential.  Similarly, we can use Fourier's law for thermal conduction, \(\mathbf{j}_{Q} = - \tilde{\kappa}\cdot \nabla T\), where \(\mathbf{j}_{Q}\) is a heat current density, \(T(\mathbf{r})\) is the temperature distribution, and \(\tilde{\kappa}\) is the thermal conductivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometime around 1933, two teenage cousins, Harry Hall and Will Cubbon, paid a visit to a new friend of theirs named Gef. Gef lived in a remote, windswept farmhouse on the Isle of Man. He was very shy, and the cousins could hear and talk to him, but never saw their new friend. From behind a wall, Gef would guess heads-or-tails when a coin was flipped or play catch with a rubber ball through a hole in the attic ceiling.

But soon, Gef began misbehaving: spitting and threatening the boys that he would “wet on [their] head!” Gef, it turns out, was no normal boy—he was a poltergeist in the form of a talking mongoose.

Doarlish Cashen, the farmhouse where Gef resided, was in many ways the stereotypical haunted house. It was an ancient farmstead on a notoriously fairy-filled, desolate isle, sit…]]></summary>

U.S. Highway 6, named the "Grand Army of the Republic" highway in honor of the Union Army during the Civil War, was one of the earliest coast-to-coast numbered routes. It was extended into Nevada in 1937, the stretch from Ely (pronounced "EE-lee") to Tonopah following the Midland Trail, an early “national auto trail” also called the Roosevelt Trail.

The route of U.S. 6 in Nevada has gone largely unchanged since 1937. It crosses Nevada mostly to the south of US 50, and in the nearly 300 miles between the Utah state line and the California state line, there are only two towns with populati…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-30T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the township of Itakura, Gunma, a bizarre sculpture lurks in the sleepy, poorly-lit lobby of a local community center. 

An eldritch entity composed of countless coleopteran corpses in the style of Oogie Boogie, the Konchū Senju-Kannon is the stuff of entomophobic nightmares. Haloed by the iridescent sheen of jewel beetles’ carapaces and crowned with a longicorn cocoon, the goddess sits on a throne of creepy-crawlies with the mandibles of stag beetles jutting out in every direction. At her feet, a swarm of drone beetles make up the pedestal, giving a bronze-green luster to it.

Neatly composed of over 20,000 insect specimens, the Konchū Senju-Kannon ("thousand-armed insect goddess of mercy") was created over a span of six years by one Mr. Inamura, an Itakura local who pursued the hobby of insect collecting. In Japan, the collector's typical game consists of different kinds of beetles, such as the rhinoceros, stag, and longicorn, quite common in the countryside.

Bright green with tints of rainbow, the jewel beetle has been highly valued for its rare beauty since antiquity, most notably used in the eighth century to make the Tamamushi Shrine of Hōryū-ji. No doubt inspired by this National Treasure, the goddess of Itakura is also modeled after the Kannon statue enshrined at Tōshōdai-ji Temple.

Perhaps ironically, this particular statue is dedicated to all the lives of insects lost at the hands of mankind, be it a victim of pesticide or specimen-making. Known as mushi-kuyō, the practice of memorializing insects is not itself an uncommon tradition in Japanese Buddhism (as seen in Ueno and Kamakura) if not as elaborate as the Insect Goddess.

Depending on the viewer, the goddess may be breathtaking or stomach-turning, exquisite or eccentric, a work of goodwill or hypocrisy. Regardless of your opinion, she continues to sit in the shadows in a perpetual state of prayer, full of mercy towards the little creatures.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The key thing to make your code run faster is to avoid building large linear-algebra objects. For example, if you need to get the matrix product A.x, where A is a huge matrix and x is a long vector, and you only ever use the matrix A to do this one multiply by x, there is no reason to actually create A. Just create a function that evaluates A.x for any input x. That should be way faster, because of less memory allocation, and because you don't have to make the parts of the matrix that are all zeros (for example).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jimbocho district of Tokyo is known for its decades-old cafés. Viennese coffee was first introduced to the Japanese public in 1953 at the Ladrio, one of the java joints situated in a narrow alley. The rich, potent concoction quickly became a favorite spot of countless authors, artists, publishers, bibliophiles, and college students, who liked it as it stayed hot underneath the thick layer of whipped cream as they sat discussing for hours on end.

That same year, the café opened a sister location right across the alley named “Milongo,” which advertised itself as an Argentine tango café. It may seem like a niche genre today, but post-war Japan was in the midst of a dance craze at the time. Its influences are also evident in some of the popular music of the later Shōwa era.

Milonga has maintained its musical theme over the years, even after the fever all but died out elsewhere. To this day, it keeps on playing Argentine tango music on vinyl, filling the warmly lit room with comfortable Latin crooning and phonographic crackles. 

The café underwent a major renovation in 1995 and renamed itself as Milonga Nueva: the new Milonga. It was now home to charcoal-roasted coffee and numerous brands of beer from around the world, even while the music remained. To this day, the interior is decorated with an impressive collection of vintage LP records, books, bottles and coasters.

In 2023, the Milonga Nueva had to relocate due to the original brick-walled building growing deteriorated from age. Fortunately, it did not stray much farther, spiritually or physically. Even though it's now housed in a newer building, the vibe hasn't changed drastically; Argentine tango still plays all day, and the menu boasts smoky coffee and a good selection of beer, along with its famous pizza, Japanese-style curry, and biscotti.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Eastern Europeans, arcades elicit a healthy dose of nostalgia—perhaps even more so than people from other places with a history of arcades.

In Eastern Europe, arcades survived well into the 2000s as a viable business model. Often in the form of mobile arcades that drove around to smaller towns in the summer. The Krakow Arcade Museum brings all of that back to life with a massive collection of over 100 vintage machines.

In communist Poland, a single arcade machine could cost as much as a new car and would cost about .50 Euros to play a machine. Despite that, they were massively popular. Most machines paid themselves off within a month and went on the make a profit after that. 

A lot of arcade machines lasted well into the 2000s in dedicated arcades or on game trucks that drove to smaller towns and villages.

Today, the Krakow Arcade Museum has collected over 100 games ranging from classics, such as Packman, to newer games, such as Dance Dance Revolution. At the arcade, you pay per hour of play. This way you do not have to worry about coins or credits, but can just play whatever you want.]]></summary>

Moss and ferns dot the sides of the sandstone, and gorges get narrower the further in you go, giving it a tunnel-like quality. Wildlife such as raccoons can be seen even during the day tucked away in the holes on the sides of the canyon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dunadd Fort rises tall from what is called Moine Mhor, meaning the "great moss" an expanse of flat boggy land at the southern end of Kilmartin Glen. The site was the center of power for the Gaelic kings of Dál Riata, who ruled Scotland from about 500 to 800. Dunadd is one of the few places referenced in early histories, with its first mention in the year 673.

It is obvious why Dunadd was considered a desirable position to build a fortification and why it went on to become the center of a kingdom. Standing in a natural boggy basin, the fort sits on top of the hillside, which was put to good use as part of the fort's natural defenses. To get to the citadel at the top level of the hill you have to pass through a narrow natural passage, as well as a series of terraces, each with the remains …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 1950s, the new West Berlin government called many famous architects from all across the world to come and rebuild the destroyed city. One of these architects was Le Corbusier. The Swiss-French architect, writer, designer, urban planner, and painter was then at the height of his renown. Le Corbusier, who was born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, had by then already designed several of these "Unité d'Habitation" apartment buildings. The first was in Marseille in 1952, followed by one in Nantes, France in 1955.

When he presented his plans for the Unité d'Habitation of Berlin to the West Berlin government, the building was deemed too large to be built in the city's center. Eventually, construction began in 1956 in an outer Berlin suburb known as Flatowallee. 

Le Corbusier and local authorities had more disagreements, however. The original plan of the building called for many community amenities, including such as a kindergarten on the roof and shops on the seventh floor. But those amenities were never built, and instead, giving way to more housing. 

The apartments were also altered from Le Corbusier's original plan. German building regulations required the carefully designed spaces to have taller ceilings--something that to Le Corbusier's mind disrupted the balance of the space. 

Eventually, a children's playground was added on the grounds and a laundrette, bank, supermarket, and post office were all crammed into the first floor. But Le Corbusier was already fed up with the project by then and refused to have any association with it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Moche civilization, also known as the Mochica culture, was an ancient civilization that thrived along the northern coast of present-day Peru from around the years 100 to 800. Renowned for their impressive artistic achievements, advanced agricultural practices, erotic pottery, and complex social organization, the Moche people left a lasting impact on the region's history.

Religion played a central role in Mochica society. They worshipped a pantheon of deities, with the "Decapitator" being one of the most prominent figures that was often depicted in their art. Ritual human sacrifices were performed to appease these gods and ensure agricultural prosperity and social order. 

Moche is also the name of a town located near the city of Trujillo on the northern coast of Peru. While this town is known for its renowned beaches along the Pacific Ocean, a hidden history awaits those who seek it. A pathway adorned with contemporary depictions of Mochica Gods, now winds its way towards these shores.

Embark on a unique journey where each deity comes to life through modern sculptures portraying eerie or awe-inspiring creatures. From the enigmatic half-man and half-crab, to the imposing humanoid evil-looking fish, a total of 10-20 statues bring their stories to life. Each statue is accompanied by informative details about the corresponding deity. (You can find a similar assemblage of statues in the town of Chiclayo, Peru, called the Paseo Yortuque.)

As you traverse this evocative pathway, you'll encounter illustrated arcs that add an extra layer of aesthetic detail. The route culminates close to the ocean's edge, offering a seamless segue for visiting the beaches of Acapulco or Playa de las Delicias.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Led by artist and stonemason Austin Emery, 'The Cornerstone' is a community artwork made up of numerous individual hand-carved stone blocks.

The blocks were created by public participants consisting of 100 children and adults from the nearby Whites Grounds Estates, as well as the wider community, in public workshops who sported goggles, mallets, and chisels for the effort. What makes the work more curious is that the stone blocks consisted of fragments from Southwark Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, and the Houses of Parliament, as well as bone fragments found on the foreshore of the Thames.

This is symbolic in the art piecing together aspects of London's history, especially that of Bermondsey, which was once a bustling area of commerce due to its proximity to the Thames. The idea was to create a piece of living art heritage for the communities from the estates around Bermondsey.

As a result, a quirky and eye-catching creation now stands as a sort of landmark in this rather touristic part of town, the artist having initiated the project with the goal of making a project further influenced by residents of the area.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go-en is a significant aspect of Japanese culture, a unique concept of relationship, causality, serendipity, opportunity, and fate. It's somewhat similar in spirit to the phrase "God willing" in monotheistic cultures, but more hopeful and associated with good luck in general. The word is also commonly used in romantic context, and many Shinto shrines are popular for their influence in en-musubi ("tying the knot").

Takagi Shrine in Sumida City, Tokyo, is one of the few shrines in Japan dedicated to Takami-Musubi, an androgynous deity of creation and birth, who was born as the second entity in the universe's history according to Japanese mythology. Because of their name, the shrine is associated with the concept of en-musubi, as well as, well, rice balls.

In Japan, rice balls are known as onigiri and omusubi, meaning "clasped" and "fastened," respectively. At Takagi Shrine, you can find them everywhere, piles of tiny pebbles with cute faces and seaweed wrappers drawn on them. Hidden like Easter eggs, even in the guardian lion-dog's mouth, the rounded triangles are easily distinguishable and can be also seen in the prayer boards, amulets, you name it. Visitors can also take a tiny "musubi stone" home upon purchasing a goshuin stamp.

Interestingly, despite the extensive musubi-inspired theming, the shrine's main subject of worship was not Takami-Musubi when it was established in 1468 AD. Prior to the Shinto-Buddhism separation of 1868, the shrine was managed by the adjacent Buddhist temple and originally known as Dairokutensha, dedicated to Dairoku-Tenma-Ō, the "Devil King of the Sixth Heaven."

Identified with the demon Mara, this Buddhist Devil is known as an evil tempter and deceiver of monks. In spite of that, there still are multiple Dairokutensha shrines across Japan. Some believe that they may have been influenced by Oda Nobunaga, the most infamous warlord of feudal Japan, who gave himself the moniker of the Devil King to instill fear into his enemies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coastal Peru is a landscape of deep-cut ravines and the glacial melt of Andes-spawned rivers cascading through narrow, arid corridors to a waiting Pacific Ocean. If you look at a modern road map of the country, you will see a network of highways cutting northeast through the mountains, linking the high plateau of the Amazonian interior to the dry cliffs overlooking the sea. 

These present-day roads mimic the footpaths of ancient people who migrated to South America and sought their own routes to the coast, finding fertile, protected valleys along the way where they created something spectacular. We don’t yet know exactly when these people first arrived in what is now Peru, but we do know when they built the civilization at Caral-Supe: 2627 B.C.

And that date is, in a word, stunning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since leaving my native Norway, I find myself constantly telling people about brunost. Pronounced “broon’ust,” it simply means “brown cheese.” But brunost is nothing like any other cheese.

The taste starts with a salty, rich caramel, and under the sweetness there’s a pleasant funk, courtesy of a mix of goat’s and cow’s milk. Eating it is momentarily overwhelming, as it sticks to the roof of your mouth before melting away. Its dense, sticky texture even requires a cheese plane, a special spatula-shaped tool for shaving off long pieces.

It used to be nearly impossible to get brunost outside of Norway, but in recent years, it’s become a craze in an unlikely place—South Korea. Brunost is now everywhere across the nation, from cafes to street food stands. Interestingly, Koreans have made br…]]></summary>

The grand home was the seat of the Montgomerie family, who held the title of Earls of Eglinton. The Montgomerie family was among William the Conqueror's most powerful allies. After his success at the Battle of Hastings, William rewarded the family with extensive lands across both England and Scotland. The original castle was burnt in 1528 by the Earl of Glencairn, who was also responsible for many raids on nearby Kilwinning Abbey during the same period.

In 1797, the earl began work on an extravagant new residence. The architect was John Patterson, who had trained under the …]]></summary>

During that trip, it became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, specifically the European Space Agency's Giotto. An illustration of Giotto appears in the middle of the comet.

Wiley Post had used his old but trusty Winnie Mae for both his round-the-world trips. However, Winnie Mae was now outdated, and Post needed a new aircraft for his Alaska-Russia venture. Struggling for funds, Post decided to piece together a plane that would suit his needs. 

Starting with a fuselage from a Lockheed Orion, Post added extra-long wings from a Lockheed Explorer. He then changed out the regular engine and replaced it with a 550-horsepower Wasp engine that was 145 pounds heavier t…]]></summary>

The tunnels are full of dining options and various shopping/service locations catered towards the employees of all the offices occupying the buildings above.

The tunnel system has been around for nearly a century. The earliest known tunnels date back to the 1930s. According to the Houston Chronicle, one of the first tunnels connected two buildings owned by former Texas Governor Ross Sterling: the Houston Post-Dispatch and the Sterling Building. The tunnel ran beneath Fannin Street. Around the same time, entertainment entrepreneur Will Horwitz had a tunnel connecting his three theaters, the Travis, the Texan, and the Uptown.

According to architectural historian Stephen Fox, the idea of a system of shared tunnels came about in 1956, when the Bank of the Southwest was linked to the 1010 Garage and the Mellie Esperson Building. As the city grew in the 60s and 70s, so did the underground tunnels.

Each section of the tunnels has its own aesthetic, often an extension of the buildings directly above, which vary wildly from haphazard and dingy to spacious and modern. The tunnels are only open during the weekday business hours.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-29T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nicknamed "the HydroCake" by the construction company Hydrostorage, Inc., this iconic water tower was built to provide support to the newly opened dairy processing plant, frozen food warehouse, and expanded bakery plant. And boy, does it do its job well - with the ability to deliver a whopping 250,000 gallons of water per minute.

But let's talk about the real star of the show here: the cake itself. Standing at a staggering 146 feet tall, this tower is like the world's biggest, baddest, most delicious birthday cake. And let's not forget the candles—10 in total, each representing five years of Publix history. And that eleventh candle in the middle? That's for the years to come.

This tower is made up of a whopping 2.25 million pounds of steel, secured by two tons of welding rods, and resting on a foundation of 170 cubic yards of concrete. It's like the Hulk of water towers—strong, sturdy, and built to last. And those candles are no slouches either. Each one stands at a towering eight feet tall and weighs in at a solid 250 pounds. That's like having 10 Shaquille O'Neals perched on top of your water tower.

But perhaps the best part of the Publix Birthday Cake water tower is the way it lights up the night sky. Every evening, the lights at the top of the tower turn on, and that center candle serves as an aerial blinker, like a delicious lighthouse guiding ships to safety. It's a sight to behold, and one that has served as an iconic beacon in the Lakeland community for years.

The tower has become a symbol of the community and a beacon of hope for those who call Lakeland their home. It's a structure that represents the strength and resilience of the people of Lakeland.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might be a stretch to call this place a botanical garden. Bone menagerie. Pseudo-science workshop. Psychedelic trip through a macabre, outdoor fantasy world would all be more appropriate. But it’s well worth the €10 entrance fee, if only for the bizarre photos.

The island of Bonaire has long been a mecca for scuba divers, especially those who enjoy shore dives. With 63 official dive sites on the main island—marked with distinctive, yellow-painted rocks—and another 26 easily accessed from a boat on the adjacent island of Klein Bonaire, most people choose to spend their time diving and snorkeling along the southern and western coasts and enjoying the excellent seafood restaurants found in the capital of Kralendijk.

But the northern and eastern coasts of this boomerang-shaped island are known as the “wild side”. Windward and rocky, the wild side boasts a national park, blow holes, petroglyphs, and the Bonaire Botanical Garden. This is a privately-owned garden, so don’t expect a national park-caliber tour. Instead, you should expect the unexpected and take most of it with a grain of salt.

If you’re lucky, Manuel, the owner of the garden, will be there to take you on the tour. He will detail his inspiration for many of the art exhibits built from found materials and animal bones, share his beliefs on the healing properties of various plants, and extol the supposed virtues of drinking quantities of seawater daily.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduced in 1633, the Sangpyeong Tongbo coinage was first issued by a government famine relief organization called the Stabilization Office, or Sangpyeong-chong in Korean, during the reign of Emperor Injo. Variations of this coin would continue to be issued for years after this, up until 1884.

A small section in the Bank of Korea’s currency museum, dubbed the Sangpyeongtongbo Gallery, focuses on the history and many varieties of the Joseon dynasty’s most widely circulated coinage.

Reportedly, the Bank of Korea’s collection once possessed 3,137 different varieties, but it’s estimated that Sangpyeong Tongbo boasted over 5,000 varieties throughout its history, many now lost and undocumented. Originally minted at the Stabilization Office, the coins were later issued by other government offices as well, each variety bearing a different mint mark.

In the mid-18th century, other marks were also introduced, indicating the number of the furnace the coin was cast in. They were represented by a single Chinese character, such as those standing for the Chinese zodiac, the five elements, and the Thousand Character Classic.

The Bank of Korea also boasts a collection of cash-shaped amulets, including the so-called open-work charms. One is even shaped after a pair of fish (or maybe a fish cut open), a fanciful amulet you might not realize it’s even coin-shaped at first glance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hoi An Ancient Town is a popular destination in Vietnam, with narrow bustling streets full of historic monuments and traditional lanterns, charming shops and restaurants, as well as beach resorts close by.

Among such vibrant places of interest, a small museum dedicated to local archaeology is not likely to attract crowds of tourists, especially when there are other museums focusing on Hoi An’s history and cultural lifestyles. Nevertheless, the Museum of Sa Huỳnh Culture offers a fascinating look into Vietnam’s Iron Age, which flourished in the region between the 10th century BCE and the 4th century CE.

Named after a small village in Quảng Ngãi Province where the first site was found in 1909, Sa Huỳnh culture is known for its ironware, gemstone beads, and terra-cotta burial jars, not unlike those found in the Philippines.

It is known that Sa Huỳnh, the Philippines, as well as Taiwan, Borneo, and Thailand, were connected along an ancient trade route. Sa Huỳnh is one of the few cultures that made ling-ling-o, a type of ancient ring-shaped amulet in the ancient Philippines, using jade imported from Taiwan.

Founded in 1994, the Museum of Sa Huỳnh Culture is home to nearly 1,000 locally sourced artifacts, the largest of its kind. One of its major highlights is the exhibit of burial jars on the second floor.]]></summary>

And given the adaptability of these flying mammals, it’s quite likely there will be bats wherever you are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Old Colony Tap has all the trappings of a nautical, nostalgia-inducing dive bar, and that's because it is one. Exactly as grungy and historic as it looks, Old Colony has been called a “true surviving vestige of hardscrabble Provincetown.” In an episode of Parts Unknown, Anthony Bourdain popped in for some Wellfleet oysters, describing the haunt as a place “where fishermen eat.”

Prior to its tenure as the diviest of dives, the building itself was home to a restaurant called the Ocean Breeze. Manuel G. Cook established Old Colony Tap in 1937, which was bought by the Enos family in 1954. Over the decades, local artists added their own aesthetic touches to the space, often practically on top of one another. James Wingate Parr “painted the walls that weren’t covered with driftwood” claimed one account in 2002, while an artist named Ernesto left his mark with a blowtorch.

The bar's collection of decorative oddities on the walls continued to grow, courtesy of donations by local fisherman. Today, the deliberately weird blend of bric-a-brac, which ranges from tchotchkes to old life preservers salvaged from a World War II merchant ship, is very much part of the charm. 

Old Colony Tap remains in the Enos family to this day. Whether it's Tuesday at 11 a.m. or Saturday at midnight, you can find a stragglers sidled up to the bar. Admittedly, it's pretty easy to lose track of time once you've spent an hour inside this maximalist time warp of a drinking hole.]]></summary>

The celestial event that brings summer to a close is one you might typically take for granted. It’s a full Moon again, when Earth’s companion is opposite the sun from us, and its whole face is illuminated in our sky. A full Moon happens every month, of course. But that reliable return belies the distinctive, individual nature of each lunar cycle. And this full Moon has more superlatives than most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was working on a white paper on ocean dynamics today and I threw in a sentence about how emulators (like machine-learning replacements for simulations) might be working because they might be effectively learning a high-order integration method. I then threw in a sentence about how, in many applications, high-order integrators are known to be better than low-order integrators. I then went to find a reference and... well, I am not sure I can back that up with a reference! I thought this was common knowledge, but it looks like almost all simulations and integrations are done with low-order integrators. Am I living in a simulation?

The term “bay leaf” originally referred to foliage from the bay laurel tree. Bay laurel's distinctive herbal flavor, bitter and slightly piney, has been used as a seasoning for millennia. But the name has become shorthand for several other leafy spices from different trees.

All of them are used to flavor food, either added to dishes whole or sometimes ground into a powder. However, the similarities often end there, and one type of bay leaf doesn’t necessarily make a goo…]]></summary>

As it approaches, homes, a lighthouse, and a red-roofed research center pop into focus amid dense forest. Docked boats herald the ferry with honks, and dogs bark from ship to shore. Upon arrival on Beaver Island, a lively community center and welcoming crowd beckon family and visitors ashore. On the island it’s customary to wave, or at least lift a finger, for each passing vehicle—every single one.

Bassett Island takes its name from the Civil War veteran Richard "Dick" Bassett, who lived on the island from 1877 to 1900.

At the time of the original survey of the area and islands in 1847, and following corrections in 1851, the small island was not properly "meandered"—surveyed and described—on the federal maps, which would have made it eligible for a claim by land patent.

The work of art consists of a dog walker in a state of distress with 10 canine companions for company, each in a different position. The sculptures were constructed using powder-coated aluminum, which was later compressed into grid-like structures to give each part 3-D transparency. Pine has developed a reputation across the city of Perth for her eye-catching works of art and this is just one of her many works that were commissioned across the city.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Believed to have germinated in 1540, the mighty Wye Oak stood tall and proud in the small town of Wye Mills, Maryland. In 1919, it earned the distinction of being the first tree ever listed in the American Forestry Association's "Tree Hall of Fame."

The Wye Oak inspired the American Forestry Association's Big Tree Champion program in 1925 and was named one of the first National Champion Trees in 1940.

With a circumference of 31 feet a height of 96 feet, and a 119-foot crown spread, it was the largest white oak in the United States and the State Tree of Maryland from 1941 until it was destroyed in a massive thunderstorm on June 6, 2002. It was still producing maturing acorns when it fell.

Thousands of seedlings cloned from the Wye Oak have been planted across the United States. Locally, there are two at Mount Vernon near Alexandria, Virginia, and another that was planted within the remains of the trunk of the original tree in a ceremony on June 6, 2006. A marker stands near the site of the cloned tree.

Wye Oak State Park was founded in 1939 and has grown from a single acre to 29 acres, and a small schoolhouse—the second oldest in Talbot County—still stands on the site.

Also on display is a segment of a huge branch that weighed 35 tons and reached almost 50 feet in length. The branch segment is preserved within a gazebo near the back of the main park area.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long Ya Men, or Dragon’s Teeth Gate, was a craggy granite outcrop that once stood at the gateway to Keppel Harbour in Singapore, near the present site of Labrador Park. Known locally by the Malays as Batu Berlayer ("sailing rock"), it served as navigational aids to ancient mariners sailing around this narrow channel, along with another rock on the opposite side.

In the 14th century, the outcrops were recorded by the traveler Wang Dayuan in his travelogue Daoyi Zhilüe. During that time, there was a large settlement in the area that was prone to pirate attacks. It is also said that the rocks assisted Zheng He, a Chinese explorer who navigated around Singapore during his seven voyages to the west. 

The more prominent of the two outcrops was known as "Lot's Wife" to the British sailors, referring to the Biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Unfortunately, both were blown up in 1848 by Straits Settlements surveyor John Thomson in order to widen the entrance to the new harbor.

In 2005, a 19-foot (6-meter tall) stone replica of Long Ya Men was built near its original site to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's maiden voyage. It was originally designed to replace the nearby Berlayer Beacon, but in the end, the replica was placed a few feet away from it instead, due to the Singapore Heritage Society's objection that the beacon itself was a heritage site.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If a trip through Route 66 involves looking at roadside attractions and “world’s largest” objects, then you could say the town of Vega, Texas is “on brand.” The Milburn-Price Culture Museum has been home to the World’s Largest Branding Iron since 2018

Even before the creation of Route 66, Vega had a long ranching history. The XIT Ranch was at one point the largest in the world, with three million acres of fenced-in land across the Texas Panhandle and 150,000 heads of cattle. The brand was designed by Abner “Ab” Blocker, who drew the brand with his boot in the dust when challenged to come up with a design that couldn’t be easily burned over.

In 2018, the Milburn-Price Culture Museum commissioned a 22-foot-long, 3,000-pound branding iron, emblazoned with the XIT brand, created by Greg Conn, the museum’s director. The goal of the iron is to tell the story of the Panhandle’s ranching heritage, while also convincing tourists traveling Route 66 to veer a block off course and spend some time in Vega. The rest of the museum has its own share of treasures, such as a Model T Ford, a working printing press from 1896, and a climbable ankylosaurus sculpture named Hank.]]></summary>

Volcanoes can be life-threatening for fish. A major eruption in 2011 in Chile, for instance, killed 4.5 million of them. Researchers have studied how lava flows, hot gases, and deadly debris can cause mass die-offs or even cut fish off from the sea in suddenly landlocked lakes. But few have been able to document in detail the grisly fates experienced by the unlucky fish that find themselves at the mercy of an angry volcano. That’s why when one erupted under…]]></summary>

Leśna Galeria is a private art exhibition of Mr. Janusz Kowal, a local resident who dabbles in many forms of art and homeopathic healing. The creatures that he builds are made in much the same way as one would make a classical "witch broom," from birch branches that are tied together around a stick.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the town of Shoshone, California, is a unique ghost town of carved-out cave dwellings called Dublin Gulch. In the late 1800s, miners and railroad workers created hillside living quarters in the cliffs. These cave dwellings kept the residents cool during the scorching summer heat and provided insulation from the freezing Mojave Desert winters.

Most of these cave dwellings have just one room. However, a few of the homes have multiple rooms, wall niches, and fireplaces with stove pipes protruding from the top of the bluff. One of the dwellings even has a large garage carved out.

The exact dates of habitation aren't known, but "1870" is carved largely near one dwelling, and it's believed that people lived in these caves on and off up until the mid-1970s. There are rumors that several Manson family members lived in these caves after Charles Manson kicked them out of Barker Ranch. A well-known Death Valley prospector by the name of Frank “Shorty” Harris also lived in the Dublin Gulch.

To visit Dublin Gulch, it's easily accessible by car (park just off of  Highway 127 near the Shoshone Cemetery) or on foot (walk over from the Shoshone Museum). Most of the dwellings are a quarter-mile up a rough dirt road. They are easy to find and some dwellings are open for exploration. Some of the cave homes are locked or only visible through windows.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first successful human-to-human heart transplant surgery was a remarkable feat and one of the most publicized events in medical history. This small museum within the hospital where the procedure took place tells the story of this event and the doctor behind it.

The procedure was performed by Professor Christiaan Neethling Barnard on December 3, 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Barnard and his team transplanted the heart of a 25-year-old woman, Denise Darvall, who had been hit by a car while crossing the street to buy a cake. Her heart went to Louis Washkansky, a 53-year-old man who was dying from chronic heart disease. Washkansky survived the procedure, but died from a lung infection and pneumonia just 18 days after the surgery.

Fortunately, Barnard did not give up. He and his team found more success over the years, as they refined their technique, making major contributions to the field of organ transplantation. Today, thousands of heart transplants are done every year around the world.

The Heart of Cape Town Museum is a sectioned-off part of the hospital. The rooms have been kept in the original state with wax dummies posing as the operation crew. There are many photos and letters exposed in the museum, as well as a pair of Bernard's boots.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are dozens of towns, cities, and counties in the United States named in honor of Abraham Lincoln, but only one has the honor of having been named after our 16th president before he was president.

What would become the town of Lincoln, Illinois, was planned and surveyed from 1852-1853. Abraham Lincoln provided legal services to the town's planners. It is unknown who suggested that the town be named after him, but apparently Lincoln initially discouraged the idea, purportedly stating "nothing bearing the name of Lincoln ever amounted to much."

On August 27, 1853, the first lots of land in the new town were sold. Abraham Lincoln was on hand to officially christen the town, which had been named in his honor. As Lincoln did not drink alcohol, the juice of a watermelon was sprinkled on the ground to christen the town. The Lincoln Watermelon Monument now commemorates this forgotten and slightly odd moment in American history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the city of Wijk bij Duurstede in the Netherlands, you can find what is perhaps the world's only drive-through windmill.

It was built in the late 17th century, after Anthony van Eyndhoven submitted a request to build a windmill on one of the town gates. Rather than wheat, the mill was used to grind tree bark that could be used in the leather tanning process. Van Eyndhoven also bought the house next to the mill, and for the next several centuries, it would house the people who owned and maintained the mill.

In the 1920s, Rijn en Lek was purchased by De Vereniging de Hollandsche Molen (the Dutch Mill Society). With the rise of industrialization, the need for the mill's grinding abilities had faded. But the society wanted to preserve the history that came along with the building.

Rijn en Lek is often confused with the windmill depicted in a 17th-century painting by Jacob van Ruisdael, titled Windmill of Wijk bij Duurstede. The structure seen in the painting was torn down around 1820, though some of its foundations remain.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following some experiments and rants over the last few days with Nora Eisner (Flatiron), I wrote down today an algorithm for a hacky replacement of the Lomb–Scargle periodogram. This periodogram method has various bad pathologies, the worst of which is that it presumes that there is exactly one frequency that fully generates the data. If there are two, the assumptions are broken and the good properties are lost.
Not that my alternative has any good properties! It is like the radio interferometry method called : It involves iteratively identifying frequencies and fitting them out. It's terrible. But it might be better than some of the wacky hacks that people do right now in the asteroseismology community.CLEAN]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nestled amidst the streets of Malden, Massachusetts, an architectural gem conceals a world of operatic wonders. The historic opera house even has its own phantom.

Originally built in the late 1860s by Wilbur F. Haven, this stately mansion, with its ornate façade and intricate original details, is characteristic of the Second Empire period. When he commissioned the house, Haven was a well-off Boston hardware merchant. Later railroad contractor William Ferguson lived in the home. The home was listed on the National Register of Historic Homes in 1992.

Formerly a part of the city's famed "Doctor's Row," this remarkable mansion is the sole survivor from its heyday. Previously utilized as commercial offices and later as a funeral home in the early 1900s, the house underwent a remarkable transformation in early 2023 when the Mystic Side Opera Company took up residence.

As the company began converting the mansion into an opera house and venue for intimate concerts, an unexpected presence made itself known. The opera's General Director captured a ghostly figure on video, and soon after, the spirit began revealing its presence within the house. From ghostly footsteps to mysteriously illuminated lights (prompting the staff to implement the tradition of leaving a "ghost light" on), the enigmatic presence of the house's resident phantom has become an integral part of the opera experience, both for guests and performers alike.

Mystic Side Opera House in the heart of Malden offers a unique backdrop for an evening of artistic brilliance with an unexpected touch of mystery. The beauty of opera intertwined with the captivating history of the mansion, creates an extraordinary experience not to be missed.]]></summary>

In other words, without the Yazoo Land Scandal, the political geography of the United States might have looked quite different. Yet despite its catchy name and far-reaching consequences, few now remember the affair.

The scandal centered on Georgia, the last holdout in the process of state cessions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tourists flock to Rodeo Drive to window shop the expensive stores and art galleries, but if you keep going towards the residential area known as the Flats and take a right when you hit Sunset, you’ll come across the triangular Will Rogers Memorial Park.

Just five acres in size and often blissfully quiet, it’s home to squirrels, ducks, large koi fish, and turtles, all of whom live in and around the large pond and fountain. The fountain and surrounding area were originally part of the grounds of the Beverly Hills Hotel, which was opened in 1912 as part of a plan to develop the area, and they donated this green space to the community. 

When Sunset Park opened to the public in 1915, it was the first municipal park in the then-new city of Beverly Hills. It quickly became a celebrity enclave when actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks built their legendary home, Pickfair, in 1919. 

In 1926 entertainer Will Rogers was appointed the first “Honorary Mayor” of Beverly Hills, and in 1952 the city renamed it Will Rogers Memorial Park in his honor.

Smart, tidy, and lush—as befits the local area—it has lawns, rose gardens featuring the celebratory Beverly Hills Centennial Roses, palm trees, a dragon tree, decomposed granite walkways, energy-efficient security lights, an irrigation system, and several signs and plaques.

There are restrooms too, and the men’s one became infamous in April 1998 when singer George Michael was arrested for committing a “lewd act” there—a moment that he parlayed into the video for his song "Outside."

In 2015 the fountain was renamed the Margaret J. Anderson Fountain in honor of the first manager of the Beverly Hills Hotel, which you can clearly see at the top end of the park.]]></summary>

This specialized museum space, situated on the upper floor of the medieval Lonja dating back to the 14th century, offers visitors an educational journey into the realm of dry stone architecture. Through an array of informative panels, models, and immersive recreations, patrons gain insights into the technique itself, its various applications, and its historical context. As an added treat, the museum provides an exceptional vantage point affording one of the most panoramic views of the expansive Vega landscape, and has three related routes in the open to enjoy these constructions. 

Dry stone architecture stands as a testament to a bygone way of life, uniquely shaped by the local climate and terrain of these mountainous regions.

Employing stone, resourcefulness, and manual craftsmanship of anonymous skilled artisans comprising farmers and shepherds, who constructed an extensive network of dry stone walls, stretching across hundreds, and potentially thousands, of kilometers. These walls demarcated cultivated farmlands from thoroughfares, and in addition, they erected over a thousand huts and various water-related structures designed to endure periods of drought.]]></summary>

The deal is: Citizen scientists find candidate planets and (currently) a human (Eisner) has to vet them, to remove contamination by various sources of false positives. This turns out to be a hard problem! When problems are hard, it becomes critical to very precisely specify what you are trying to achieve. So we spent time discussing what, exactly, it is that Eisner needs from a classifier. Is it to find good planets? Is it to remove obvious contaminants? Are some contaminants more problematic than others? Is it to save her hours of wall-clock time? PlanetFindersEtc.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the sun sets on Provincetown, Massachusetts, roving visitors fill the streets, wandering to and from dive bars, live music venues, nightclubs, seaside eateries, drag shows, and beyond. But as the wee hours approach, almost every restaurant shutters. That is, every restaurant except for Spiritus Pizza.

In 1970, this pie-slinging emporium was but a twinkle in young John “Jingles” Yingling's eye. After visiting his sister in Provincetown, John clocked a comprehensive lack of pizza in town. He'd been running a successful pizza truck in Wildwood, New Jersey, but P-town had more permanent plans for his skills. 

The following year, John and his new business partner opened a spot on the now-bustling Commercial Street, where slices served on napkins sold for 25 cents. In 1976, the establishment added an ice cream arm. They coined the slogan “there’s no business like dough business.” John started a family in the 1980s, paving the way for a family business. The shop remains owned and operated by the Yinglings today.

With a local monopoly on the late-night feeding frenzy, Spiritus doesn't need to be delicious to be dominant. And yet, they crank out an undeniably tasty slice. The basic components are simple and satisfying: thin crust with a toasty crunch gives way to oregano-heavy sauce topped in a delicate layer of cheese. Those who prefer an over-the-top chaotic slice can get their fix, too, as there's no limit to the custom pies that Spiritus lets inspired patrons build.

Unlike many a midnight munchies spot, Spiritus isn't simply a weekend privilege—they're open until 2 a.m. every single night of the week. Not a pizza person? Firstly, what? Secondly, fret not. Ice cream is also available in abundance. Lactose intolerant? There's coffee, too!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Drumtroddan Rock Art site is made up of three groups of cup and ring-marked stones. Two of the groupings lie in a field, while a third is a small distance away in the coppice beyond a dyke. These carved stones probably date to the Neolithic or early Bronze Age, between 3500 and 1000 B.C.

The carved stones at Drumtroddan are among some of the most visible remains of the ancient inhabitants' culture. Cup and ring marks were carefully executed using hard stone tools.

There are at least 84 cup and ring marks, possibly more, at Drumtroddan. This includes over 64 cup marks, some with rings and some without. Cup marks are small depressions, sometimes accompanied by surrounding rings. How many you are able to find entirely depends on the lighting conditions when you visit and how long you are willing to stare at the rock faces.

They are usually found densely covering large expanses of rock. The variety of the carvings at Drumtroddan is striking, with some ring marks forming complete circles, while others are incomplete. Some show a radial groove running from the center of the circle and consist of as many as six rings.  

It is not known for certain why these markings were made, but one possible explanation is that they were territory markers, this is made plausible by the fact they are frequently found in locations with good views of the surrounding land. Other theories about their possible purposes include prehistoric belief systems, mapping, and metal prospecting.  

It is thought that there may be a link to the Drumtroddan Standing Stones found 400 meters to the northeast.]]></summary>

Yet, no art installation is more magical than that found in the quiet residential neighborhood of Wolseley. The artwork comprises a collection of Brobdingnagian animal images that decorate both sides of the rear service lane between Canora and Ethelbert Streets. All the animals depicted are those found in the Arctic, and they adorn garage doors, fences, walls, curbs, and the backs of houses in areas reserved for parked cars and rubbish cans.

The paintings are the work of Canadian artist and Winnipeg resident Kal Barteski. Her interest in drawing polar bears first surfaced in the 1980s when in design school. While mastering wildlife drawing, Barteski spent hours at the Assiniboine Park Zoo …]]></summary>

Crafted in 1972 by artist Erik Hermansson, this towering 26-foot (8-meters tall) wooden sculpture pays homage to the whimsical tales found in Tore Skogman's Årjängstroll book.
With an enchanting blend of art and storytelling, "Årjängstrollet" stands not just as a sculpture, but as a living connection to the region's heritage. Having embarked on tours across Sweden, gracing cities like Stockholm and Gothenburg, the troll has become an ambassador of Årjäng's cultural legacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a 2020 episode of his show Last Week Tonight, comedian John Oliver went on a tangent where he made fun of the town of Danbury, Connecticut. Ended the short rant by saying that anyone from Danbury had "a standing invite to come get a thrashing from John Oliver."

Danbury's mayor Mark Broughton responded with a tongue-in-cheek statement. that they'd name their sewage plant after him because it was "full of [expletive], just like you, John."

Oliver took the mock beef next level and said he'd donate $55,000 to local charities if Danbury genuinely named the plant after him and hung a sign designating the John Oliver Memorial Sewer Plant. Danbury got the last laugh and agreed.

The plant was renamed in October 2020, and John Oliver himself attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and shared a video of it in a follow-up segment on Last Week Tonight. "This place takes the worst that humanity can produce, and transforms it into something that we can live with,” Oliver said. “And now more than ever, there’s something inspirational in that, because at the end of this awful, awful year, what could be more important than evidence that, if we want to, we can come together, overcome our differences, and sort our shit out.”]]></summary>

Let’s face it: You don’t get to more than 60 countries across six continents without a lot of planning, perseverance, and creative thinking. From her home in Bengaluru, in southern India, Sudha Mahalingam has explored some of the world’s most remote destinations, from the temples on China’s sacred Mt. Emei to the towering dunes of Namibia, and its most iconic cities, from Chicago to Venice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Located in the town of Great Dunmow is Doctor’s Pond, named due to the widespread belief that it was a breeding ground for leeches, a creature highly sought after by doctors. Leeches have been highly valued in medicine for millennia, most of all for their use in bloodletting.

Brick House, also known as Doctor’s House, stands beside the Pond, and it is believed that the doctors practicing here made the most of their proximity to the pond to source a steady supply of the significant bloodsuckers.

In addition to its connection to the town's medical community, Doctor’s Pond has also played a significant role in maritime history. Lionel Lukin, an inventor from Great Dunmow, is credited with creating the world's first "lifeboat," a self-righting and ever-buoyant vessel that “will neither overset in violent gales or sudden bursts of wind, nor sink if by any accident filled with water."

Doctor’s Pond served Lukin as the testing ground for his lifeboat models, which, though unrecognized in his time, went on to revolutionize water rescue operations.]]></summary>

Created by the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum, which carved out the whole canyon that surrounds the strange stone outcroppings, these two stones are called "Karl og Kerling." The name translates to "husband and wife." The pair of stones stands near the mouth of the biggest cave in the canyon. The canyon is known as Jökulsárgljúfur.

According to Icelandic folklore, the married trolls started to argue as they made their way home one evening. But the pair soon lost track of time and night turned to early dawn. The trolls, still in the heat of the argument, didn't notice the rising sun. When the sun finally crested the nearby hill, the sunlight turned the trolls to stone. Trolls, of course, are nocturnal creatures.

The trolls weren't far from the cave they called home when the sunlight petrified the beasts. Still today, on the opposite side of the river, you can see the entrance of the cave called Trollahellir, the "troll cave," where the pair slept.]]></summary>

Whether you’re strolling down a city street, deep in an old-growth forest, or standing on a barren, rocky Antarctic beach, chances are you’re not alone. You just might not notice the flycatcher, woodpecker, or skua that has likely noticed you. Birds are among the most diverse and widely distributed animals—and learning how to find and appreciate them doesn’t require anything more than your powers of observation.

It was her first visit to the greater Washington D.C. area, and she found the many wooden and clapboard homes dotting residential streets fascinating…and familiar. “I thought, ‘Wow! We have these in Freetown,’” says Thomas, referring to her country’s capital city. “I think I even said to my mother, ‘Look, they also have Krio bod os.’” Thomas, a heritage practitioner, now lives in London, but that moment still resonates with her. It was more than the local architecture that Thomas had seen on that trip, it was her own country’s history.

Fonueau and Salofa lived in Western Samoa. One year, there was a great famine, and the pair went many days without food. Eventually, they smelled food cooking in the village, but no one ever brought any to share with the mother and daughter.

Desperate, Fonueau and Salofa left their home and went to the ocean. Together, they jumped off a cliff and into the water, where their bodies were transformed into those of a turtle and a shark. They swam and swam, and eventually arrived at the village of Vaitogi, where they emerged from the water and resumed their human forms. The villagers welcomed Fonueau and Salofa warmly, offering food and clothing. They returned to the ocean but lived just beyond the cliffs, and returned to the village often.

As the story goes, the pair gave the villagers a song that could be used to call them from these rocks.]]></summary>

The original Modoribashi Bridge was built in 794 when Kyoto became the imperial capital of Japan, and still stands on its site despite countless reconstructions.

The name of the bridge derives from a medieval legend: when Confucian scholar Miyoshi Kiyotsura died in 918, his son Jōzō came to Ichijo in great haste from the mountains of Kumano, where he was training to be a monk, just as the funeral parade was crossing the bridge. Jōzō clung to his father’s coffin and prayed, and with a roar of thunder, Kiyotsura miraculously came back to life…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Provincetown, or P-town, is perched on the tip of northern Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Sure, the Mayflower arrived here in 1620, but this seaside haven is full of less-expected, more colorful surprises. Today, it's a vibrant getaway for gay men and artists.

In between P-town’s iconic eras as a pilgrim dock and an LGBTQ+ party destination, a steady stream of Portuguese seafarers arrived. In the late 1800s, they introduced the Cape to linguiça sausage, pastel de natas, kale soup, and other culinary delights from the western boundary of the Iberian Peninsula.

In 1936, one of these Portuguese families took over an existing bakery at 299 Commercial Street. Their expansive repertoire of breads, flaky pastries, buns, and malassadas have beckoned passersby inside ever since.

What’s a malassada, you ask? The phrase mal assada means “undercooked” in Portuguese, which refers to the fried sweet’s golden-brown exterior that gives way to a soft, doughy inside. At Provincetown Portuguese Bakery, they arrive still hot, with a generous coating of cinnamon sugar. Immigrants from Portugal have debuted this treat around the world to hyper-enthusiastic results (case in point: in Hawaii, the holiday that most anglophone Catholics call “Fat Tuesday” is known as “Malasada Day”.)

As the institution has changed Portuguese hands over nearly nine decades in service, family recipes have continued to join the canon of carbs on offer. According to the current owners, a few of the baked goods are the product of recipes from the original bakery’s founders, circa 1901.

While the linguiça-stuffed croissant and lemon-scented pastel de nata are worth penning home about, Provincetown's finest and only Portuguese bakery knows that the way to hook customers, no matter where they're from, is to proudly fry dough in the front window of the bakery. You can’t (and won’t want to) miss it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ankeruhr is a bridge-like connection between the two buildings that make up the Akerhof, spanning the alley below. Located on the bridge is the Ankeruhr, which survived the bombs of World War II.

The Art Nouveau work was created between 1911 and 1914 by Franz von Matsch. The mechanism inside was made by Franz Morawetz, the court clockmaker of the time. The clock is designed as a linear clock, where figures move along a scale covering an hour period of time, to be replaced by the next figure for the next hour. The figures are moved by a chain drive. The hour is marked in Roman numerals above each figure's head, while the minutes are read along the scale.

There is a chart to the side that identifies each character which includes Marcus Aurelius, Charlemagne, and various Austrian figures of historical importance including Empress Maria Theresa.

The clock marks each hour with organ music, each hour has a different piece associated with the figure; For example, Joseph Haydn is represented by his own "The Creation." Then at 12 p.m., all of the figures are presented in a parade with music.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a large turnoff across from the beautiful Flathead River near Glacier National Park, a pipe sticking out of a mountainside provides cool, clear water for locals and tourists alike.

A nearby stone marker names it the Shepard Memorial Fountain, "Dedicated to the memory of Lion Don Shepard of Kalispell"; a second nearby historical sign notes that for decades, "[this] natural spring provided water to locals and, during the early days of automobiles, helped cool more than a few overheated radiators." 

The pipe is there to make the local springwater more accessible, and water tumbles from it into a small pool full of colorful local argillite stones. And while a small, bullet-riddled sign warns "drink at your own risk," you'll often find the parking area full of locals carrying multi-gallon jugs to fill at the spring (perhaps the sign was shot up for questioning their water source). This author filled a few themself, and drank it continuously for a week with no ill effects.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Richard Serra is one of the most important sculptors of the 20th century. His work can be found in the most important galleries around the world in cities such as London, Paris, and New York. One location that doesn't quite fit here: King City, Ontario. However, this small town is inextricably connected to Serra's art: The town even has a street named after him.

King City is the home of a potato farm that Serra visited in 1970. A friend of his owned the land and paid him to complete a sculpture on the property. The completed sculpture, entitled Shift, is one of only two works that Serra ever created in concrete.

In the over 50 years since Serra created Shift, it has been forgotten and then subsequently rediscovered. Today the work is protected by the Ontario Heritage Act. Nonetheless, the work has been reclaimed by nature. The concrete is beginning to show cracks and tall grasses obscure the work. In the spring or summer, the sculpture is surrounded by flowers and wild raspberries. 

Through a fluke of fate, King City is home to one of the rarest works from one of the 20th and 21st century's most important artists.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for a remote destination in central China? Look no further than the grottoes at Bingling Temple in the country's north-central Gansu Province. Massive crowds are a common feature of many attractions throughout China: This is a good spot to escape the crowds. The temple is tucked away in a little-traveled, remote corner of the country. 

The temple complex is massive, featuring 183 caves and niches, 82 clay sculptures, almost 1,000 square yards of frescoes, and 694 carved stone statues. The temple was built in 420 during the Western Qin Dynasty. Over the centuries, more and more cave temples were excavated and others were added to. Some of the painted frescoes in the caves date back to the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368 to 1644. The site also features a giant Buddha carved into the rock face.

No roads are available to get to Bingling Temple, so you need to take a boat to reach the site. Large tourist boats leave from the outskirts of Liuxiajia in Yongjing County. Smaller motorboats are also available. These boats transport you from the Liujiaxia Reservoir toward the Yellow River and finally to the secluded cove of Bingling Temple. 

If you are lucky, you may have the entire place to yourself. But, as with most places in China, you are never truly alone: CCTV cameras guard against looting and vandalism. Some of the more delicate frescoes have been put behind glass enclosures. A walkway will guide you to the main attraction, the colossal Great Maitreya Buddha.]]></summary>

Some of the more terrifying masks are meant to ward off evil spirits and are hundreds of years old. The museum also contains Sri Lanka’s only mask library, dedicated to works about ancient plays and mask-making techniques. Most masks are carved from the poison nut tree because of its smooth, pliable wood.  

The “factory” is more of a small workshop where one can watch the artisans at work as they carve and paint the masks. It is a fifth-generation owned enterprise and represents a national dying art form. There is also a gift shop where you can purchase your own modern-made mask.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden in the woods near the picturesque little village of Symonds Yat, King Arthur's Cave is a limestone cave shrouded in local superstition. Back in the Upper Palaeolithic era, it was once occupied by man. Prehistoric artifacts such as flint tools and woolly mammoth bones have been unearthed within and around the caves, in addition to several animal bones.

It is not known how it got its name, but the Herefordshire area is well-known for its association with Arthurian legend, and the cave has some folklore related to King Arthur. According to a popular legend, the cave was fortified by King Vortigern in his battle against the Anglo-Saxon invaders, only to be besieged and taken by Aurelius and Uther Pendragon (Arthur's father).

In 1695, a skeleton of a "giant human" was reportedly discovered in the cave by a local goatherder. Unfortunately, however, it was lost when a Bristollian surgeon named Mr. Pye took it with him on a voyage to Jamaica, and his ships sank at sea.

Today, the nearby area is occupied by willow and birch trees. The cave is now home to bats and spiders, among other small animals, and probably no more giants or mammoths.]]></summary>

Gerald Hugh Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners, or simply Lord Berners, of Faringdon House ordered the installation of these 12 pointless signs around Farringdon’s marketplace in 1935. Each bears a unique and novel message such as "Children left unattended will be sold to the circus," and "Entrance to Secret Bunker." Though the signs deteriorated and disappeared over the years, they have since been restored and visitors are invited to find them all.

Visitors may also spot the famous dyed pigeons of Faringdon perched, suspiciously still, on a few Faringdon window sills. The practice of dyeing pigeons bright colors was another trivial idea of Lord Berners that continues t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Oude Kerk, or the Old church is an 11th-century church in Delft that is the final resting place of some very famous Dutchmen. One of the best-known inhabitants is Johannes Vermeer, the 17th-century painter behind paintings like Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Milkmaid.

While many may expect a grandiose tomb, in fact, Vermeer's burial place is simply marked by a small tombstone on the ground. Though some have guessed that the tombstone is so small because Vermeer was buried upright, in actuality, the stone was placed long after his death in 1675. 

Vermeer had been buried in a family crypt in the church. When he died, there was not enough money to pay for a separate tombstone. But as Vermeer became more well-known, many people visited his grave, and the stone was put there to satisfy visitors.

In 1975, on the 300th anniversary of the painter's death, a new marker was installed around the location of the former family grave. A larger one was put in place near the church's western entrance in 2007.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the intersection of Troy, Appletree, and Museum streets in Dothan, Alabama, you can find the world's smallest city block. This little triangle of land features a stop sign, yield sign, and street signs. A granite marker at the site reads as follows: "The smallest block in the world is marked by Camellia Garden Club May 1, 1964. Erected by Southside Granite Co."

So what's the deal with this bite-sized block? In 1964, it was given the title by the "Ripley's Believe It or Not" Once it held the title, the Camellia Garden Club of Dothan honored the site with a small marker. The block originally measured about 20 feet by 20 feet by 9 feet, It even had a building on it at one point. Now the block is even smaller than it once was. The change wasn't officially made to defend the title, but it would certainly be hard to find a smaller block than this.

Dothan might be better known as the “Peanut Capital of the World.”]]></summary>

After road trippers see one, the quest for other such roadside attractions often ignites. The giant who started my own hunt was named Jacques. Towering above the cars driving towards the ferry in Marblehead, Ohio, Jacques is a rescued sculpture that once hawked sandwiches in front of a restaurant. Though he was used to advertise the food service industry, Jacques is a relative of other fiberglass sculptures known as muffler men.

It is notable for being the first site in Japan to have a roana, or hearth-pit, which shed a light on domestic life in the Neolithic.

Collected from the many layers of the Tobinodai shell midden during the four excavations between 1977 and 1993 were hundreds of earthenware vessels, ancient idols, and a variety of bones, now showcased at the on-site museum alongside artifacts from other archaeological sites in the neighborhood. 

One of the most interesting exhibit here is perhaps the life-size model of a Jōmon dog, an extinct breed believed to be the ancestor of the modern Shiba Inu. Affectionately nicknamed Tobimaru, the re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Memorial to the Civilian Victims of the Japanese Occupation, which is commonly referred to as the Civilian War Memorial, is a memorial sculpture in Singapore. As the name suggests, the memorial was built in honor of the civilians killed during the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War II.

During the short period of occupation (1942-1945) thousands of ethnic Chinese were killed in the Sook Ching Massacre. The massacre was a bloody effort to remove anti-Japanese elements from occupied Singapore. As part of this "removal," Chinese men between 18 and 50 years old were forced to report to the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military police. The Japanese reported a death toll of around 6,000, but the official estimates put the number of dead much higher, with a range between 25,000 and 50,000.

Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, set aside a plot of land in March 1963 at Beach Road for a memorial dedicated to the civilians killed by the Japanese forces during the occupation of Singapore. A competition was organized to find a suitable design for the memorial, with the winning design coming from a representative of Swan and Maclaren Architects.  

The four identical pillars stand 70 meters tall, they represent the shared experiences and unity of the four major races that make up Singapore's population: Chinese, Eurasian, Indian, and Malay. The four towers of the memorial have been described by some as resembling four giant chopsticks giving it its local nickname.

Before the completion of the memorial, a ceremony was held during which 606 urns containing the remains of thousands of unknown civilian victims from mass graves were reinterred on either side of the memorial podium.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Danish artist Thomas Dambo is on a mission to populate the world with gentle giants. Rita the Rock Planter, a benevolent creature made entirely of recycled wood, is his 119th troll sculpture. Currently, his mythical creations reside in 17 different countries around the world. 

Rita the Rock Planter, who was unveiled on August 4, 2023, can be found near an old 19th-century gold mine. According to the sculptor, the kindly troll noticed all of the holes in the ground and worried about humans or small creatures falling into them. She can be seen patching up the Earth, presumably as a symbolic representation of the damage humans have caused to their natural environment. 

While Rita the Rock Planter may be an unusual sight, she's not alone in Colorado. Isak Heartstone, also known as the Breckenridge Troll, is another such fantastical being in the state. Troll-hunters and fans of Danbo's work should visit Trollmap.com for the locations of the others.]]></summary>

After the cannons were removed or ceased to be used, pigeons began to settle in the sockets left behind. Since then, families have been bringing children to feed the bustling pigeon population.  

Today, a small kiosk has been set up where you can buy pigeon feed, but the pigeons are so accustomed to feeding that they may land on you even if you don't have food. Bird toys and decorations adorn the trees in the park, put up and maintained by the adjacent Kid's Cafe (Cafe del Nino). The park also boasts a gorgeous overlook of San Juan and the San Juan Bay.

During the dwindling hours of daylight, according to a new study, certain frogs may actually glow to communicate. These frogs don’t shine on their own like bioluminescent fireflies, but they biofluoresce. This means that they absorb light at one wavelength, or color, and shoot it back out at a longer wavelength. Against a dark backdrop, this gives them a dim glow. Using a colorful array of lights—from violet to cyan to green—researchers from Florida, Peru, Br…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We share this Earth with so many incredible animals, and they live, work, and play like we do. Take the white pelicans with impressive nine foot wingspans who hang out in Florida for the winter; or the hyenas, crocodiles, and hippo who feasted unexpectedly together in Kenya; or the dolphins who frolicked with one of our scuba diving readers in the Red Sea in Egypt. To see some of these fascinating creatures in the wild—and have them see you—is to experience nature in a sublime and unforgettable way.
At Atlas Obscura, we love hearing about the wild lives of wildlife. For our third and final Summer Snaps photo contest of the year, we're calling all you animal lovers to submit photographs of your most amazing and memorable outdoor rendezvous with the world's critters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clach a' Charridh is located near Shandwick on the Tarbat Peninsula, which explains why it is also referred to as the Shandwick Stone. The Gaelic name Clach a' Charridh means "stone of the grave-plots." It seems the stone got this name because of a burial ground recorded here in 1889 which was last used during the cholera epidemic of 1832.

A Pictish stone is a type of stele that is generally carved with symbols or designs. Clach a' Charridh is referred to as a Class II Pictish stone which is rectangular in shape with a large cross and symbols on one or both sides. Pictish stones of this class usually date from the 8th or 9th century. The symbols on Clach a' Charridh are carved in relief and the cross is filled with designs. The stone was quarried from the cliffs along Shandwick Bay and t…]]></summary>

His most infamous criminal episode happened in 1906, which was so spectacular that it cemented his place in history as an international folk hero. On October 16, 1906, in Berlin, Voigt disguised himself as a Prussian army captain. He had planned the ruse carefully, buying pieces of military uniforms at different stores and testing their effect on soldiers by seeing how they reacted when he wore them. He assembled a convincing captain's uniform, which he kept in a luggage storage locker. After resigning from the shoe factory where he worked, he removed th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked away in the forest surrounding Puerto Narinó, la Fundación Natütama houses not only elaborate hand-carved replicas of local wildlife and mythical creatures, but also the secrets to the unseen, mythical world below the Amazon’s river currents.

The Amazon rainforest is home to countless species of flora and fauna, large and small, known and unknown. Alongside this animal kingdom exist spirits, beings, and entire worlds out of sight and out of reach to humankind. The Indigenous Tikuna elders who inherited these forests and rivers tell tales of seductive shapeshifting dolphins and large hairy human-like creatures that stalk the forest. There are legends of entire cities built under the river's surface, where pink dolphins and turtles live.

The Natütama Foundation is a non-profit organization that works with the community of Puerto Nariño to develop research, education, and conservation initiatives combining cultural and scientific knowledge and practices.

As part of this mission, they built the Centro de Interpetación (Environmental Interpretation Center). An education center and museum consisting of two permanent installations depicting different phases or aspects of the Amazon rivers environment that are difficult to witness in the wild. One exhibition is based on the flooded rainforest, which depicts, using wood carvings by local artisans, scenes of wildlife beneath the water's surface and among the trees. Here you can see life-sized carvings of pink river dolphins, river otters, and various fish species. These include the iconic pirañas and the pirarucu, which is the largest fish in the Amazon and a staple of the local diet.

Another building holds a pitch-black room. Barefoot, you step in and are guided through a recreation of an Amazon beach scene at night. A guide uses a flashlight to illuminate the room while recounting a local legend about a fisherman’s encounter with a river dolphin in the dead of night.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Former Temiya Line Railroad cuts through the retro port city of Otaru, running from the popular Sushiya-Dori shopping street to the Otaru City General Museum, which stands on the site of Temiya Station—the birthplace of rail service in Hokkaido.

Established in 1880 as part of the larger Horonai Railway, Temiya Line was the oldest railway line in Hokkaido and carried passengers from 1912 to 1962, after which it only ran as a freight train until its discontinuation in 1985, putting an end to the line altogether.

For years, the railroad tracks of the former Temiya Line lay all but abandoned. In 2001, the city purchased them from the Japanese Railway (JR) company in order to repurpose them as a scenic promenade, completing the project in 2016.

Now, the refurbished railroad tracks stretch on for a mile, carpeted with weeds and wildflowers. Running past many of Otaru’s landmarks, the promenade itself is a charming attraction, giving visitors a unique Stand By Me-like photo opportunity.]]></summary>

The first three-quarters are a giant refresher on the story of computability and complexity theory in the 20th century—including Turing, Gödel, Shannon, Cook, Karp, Levin, Baker-Gill-Solovay, Sipser, Razborov, Rudich, and more.  But then the last quarter gets into actually new (well, within the last couple years) developments, including the NP-completeness of “Partial-MCSP” and other progress on the Minimum Circuit Size Problem, and progress toward basing cryptography on the sole assumption PNP, and ruling out Impagliazzo’s “Heuristica” and “Pessiland” worlds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The ancient ruins of Orikum, at the south end of the Bay of Vlorë in Albania, is an important historical landmark boasting a rich history, well-preserved ruins, and a unique blend of Illyrian, Greek and Roman influences. 

Founded by Euboeans and originally situated on an island, Orikum was well-positioned for communication with Corfu and Greece. The city was only 40 miles across the sea from Otranto, making it a convenient stopover between Greece and Italy. Ancient sources described it as a harbor, but it eventually attained the status of a polis and issued its own coins from around 230 to 168 B.C.

Orikum's military importance continued under Roman rule, as it served as a base during Rome's wars with the Illyrians and Macedonia, which occupied it for a time. Julius Caesar captured the city during the civil war in 48 B.C.
Under Ottoman rule, the city was renamed Orikum Pashaliman, "the Pasha's harbor," and the lagoon and nearby Albanian navy base still bears this name today.

The city's past is not only marked by ancient history; in 1950, Pashaliman was the only Soviet base in the Mediterranean. The base became a hot spot of conflict between the Russians and Albanians in 1961. The base is still in operation today, hosting a small fleet of ships.
Visitors to Orikum can marvel at the ancient ruins, which, although not as extensive or well-preserved as other sites, are impressive nonetheless. The picturesque surroundings of the Bay of Vlorë and the verdant hillsides create a stunning backdrop, adding to the allure of this historical landmark.]]></summary>

I wish I had some sort of Proustian memory of a fancy steakhouse wedge salad, resplendent in blue cheese and crackles of bacon. But like most kids growing up in suburbia, my first exposure to iceberg lettuce involved a few wan hothouse tomatoes and a bottle of dressing with Paul Newman’s face on it.
By the time I was learning to cook as a teen, wedge salads and iceberg were hopelessly passé. I aspired to the salads spotted in the dog-eared pages of old Gourmets—turrets of microgreens and edible flowers à la Alice Waters, who famously snubbed iceberg—made in far-off places like San Francisco.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The City of Gas got its unique name from the natural gas deposits found in what was then known as Elm Township. The cheap fuel boom caused a local farmer, E.K. Taylor, to divide his farm into lots in 1898, leading to the creation of “Gas City.” The plentiful natural gas caused the town to reach a population of over 1,200 residents at its peak in 1910, however, by 1920, 70 percent of the population had left.

Gas remains on the map, with a current population of 475 residents, as measured by the 2020 census. In the 1970s, the local water tower was built, and the city council wanted to celebrate it with something fun and eye-catching. The tower was painted red to resemble a gas can, and the words “GAS KAN” were written across it, creating a play on words, and thus, the World’s Largest Gas Kan was born.

The water tower continues to serve the community, holding 100,000 gallons of water. The tower isn’t immediately visible from Highway 54, so it requires a brief, but intentional drive into town. However, a miniature replica of the Gas Kan is visible in the southwest corner of Fees Park, located at 2000th Street and West 1st Street.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In early Japanese archaeology and history, the Yayoi period is one of the major time periods that is believed to have lasted from the 10th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. Bridging the prehistoric Jōmon period and the pre-dynastic Kofun period, it saw the proto-Japanese people's shift from a hunter-gatherer society to an agricultural civilization, which led to the dawn of the Iron Age in Japan.

The historical period is named after the Yayoi district in today's Bunkyo City, then called Mukaigaoka-Yayoi, where a number of terracotta vessels were unearthed in 1884. As research advanced, archaeologists concluded that the Yayoi-type pottery was a successor to the Jōmon pottery and of a separate period. On the whole, the Yayoi pottery is plainer than the Jōmon pottery, which is often decor…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Grave of the Godstone Pirate can be found in an otherwise innocuous-looking church in Godstone.

John Edward Trenchman was born in London in the 17th century. At the age of 12, he left the city's docks and joined the crew of the notorious pirate Henry Morgan. After years at sea, Trenchman returned to England but did not leave his pirate ways behind. He smuggled goods along the country's southeast coast. But when a member of his crew was arrested and gave up the secret smuggling routes, customs officers put a stop to his piracy. 

Trenchman was wounded in the ambush. He escaped and made his way to the Fox and Hounds Inn in Godstone, but eventually succumbed to his wounds and died at the pub. Villagers buried him in an unmarked grave at the south end of the churchyard at St. Nicholas.

The church was the subject of several episodes of haunting after the pirate was initially buried in an unmarked grave at the back of the church until the priest and churchwardens removed the pirate’s body and reburied him with a full Christian service, opposite the church doors. From then on nothing more was seen or heard of Godstone’s pirate ghost.

More can be found about the pirate at the Fox and Hounds pub, where he died. The pub is a few minutes' drive from the church on the other side of Godstone. It can be found by heading into Godstone from the church and heading towards Godstone Farm (follow the signs). The pub is a little way past the Godstone Farm.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This incredible canyon features the Popo Agie River (pronounced "puh-POE-zha"), which descends through the canyon in gentle cascades. What's particularly unique about The Sinks is that the river disappears underground for about a quarter-mile, then reemerges further downstream.

It takes several hours for the water to reappear on the surface, though this same volume of water, traveling aboveground, would only take a few minutes. For years, geologists were stumped about how the river could take so long to travel such a short distance. While they still cannot confirm the passage, the theory is that there are a myriad of winding passages for the water to work through, drastically lengthening its travel time. Cracks, fissures, dead ends, and side traps create a world of obstacles for the water to overcome before reemerging and continuing its path down the canyon.

Take a night to camp in the park's beautiful campground that rests right on the river and be sure to keep an eye on the cliffs nearby when it is dark. If you spotlights bobbing along the cliff's face, it's merely local mountaineers out for a night climb.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since antiquity, frogs have been a lucky symbol in Japanese culture. For one thing, they are associated with the rain—needed to grow rice—and are considered a messenger of several deities. Additionally, the Japanese word for "frog" is homophonous with the word meaning "to return:" kaeru. Thanks to this wordplay, frogs are believed to grant safety to travelers until they return home and bring back health and money that one has spent.

At Hakata Station, one of the major transport hubs in Fukuoka, there is a small golden frog hiding in plain sight, and it is said that good luck will come to whoever finds it.

Designed by sculptor Satoshi Yabuuchi, widely known as the creator of Nara Prefecture's mascot character Sento-Kun, the Golden Frog was humbly unveiled when the JR Hakata City station mall was completed in 2011. It has since been climbing the wall of the building, unnoticed by most passengers. The idea behind its conception was that one should walk with their head up, or they would miss nice things in life.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This rural museum and water utility office honors the life of the town of Piqua’s most famous non-resident, Buster Keaton. Despite his limited relationship with the town during his lifetime, Piqua has become the truest home of the comic genius of the silent screen.

Keaton was born October 4, 1895, in Piqua, Kansas, but he never lived there. His parents, a moderately famous vaudevillian couple who performed together as “The Two Keatons,” had no connection to Piqua. However, they were in town supporting Harry Houdini’s act on the day Buster was born. Buster would grow up on the road, first performing onstage with his parents before making the jump to film. 

Keaton starred in some of the greatest comedies of the era, many of which he directed himself, revolutionizing the language of comedy filmmaking. He weathered career setbacks including the switch to sound and personal struggles, and lived to see interest in his work and career revived in the 1950s.

The famed actor visited Piqua only once in his lifetime. In 1957, Keaton and his wife, Eleanor, were driving back from the Kansas State Fair, when Eleanor saw a sign for Piqua. According to Eleanor, In shock, she stopped short, waking Buster, who was surprised to discover that his hometown even existed. In a hurry, they briefly walked through town, and pledged to come back one day.

While Keaton never returned before passing away in 1966, Eleanor would come back frequently, as Piqua and the nearby town of Iola began planning an annual festival to honor their native son. People, including Eleanor, began donating memorabilia to the festival, which was held annually from 1993 until 2023. Without the level of attendance needed to build a permanent museum, Piqua opened up the Buster Keaton Museum as a room within the water department, where it still stands today.]]></summary>

The bodies of the crew were interred in the nearby churchyard, where, with the permission of their families, they remain today.

Eoghan Daltun stood on a slope and pointed to a distant vista of verdant fields, craggy hills, and conifer trees across the Beara Peninsula in west Cork.

Sun glinted off the rocks and sheep grazed in meadows. It was serene—the sort of bucolic panorama that draws tourists and appears on Irish postcards to embody the Emerald Isle.

Daltun, however, had news for anyone tempted to marvel at nature’s majesty. “It’s ecological illiteracy. They can’t read the landscape they’re looking at. That is a completely barren landscape. It is biologically empty.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among our crosswords and other puzzles, we're featuring logic challenges from Puzzle Communication Nikoli, a cult-favorite puzzle publication from Japan. A PDF of the puzzle, as well as the solution, can be downloaded below.


Many of the challenges in Puzzle Communication Nikoli, Japan’s influential publication of logic puzzles, have been around for a while. But readers and puzzle enthusiasts are always submitting new ideas. Some get published, and among those some pick up enough fans that they earn a place in the regular puzzle lineup. Double Choco is the most recent addition to that lineup that we’ve featured in Atlas Obscura. It was created in 2018 by a reader with the pseudonym Airplane, who was a new Nikoli reader at the time.


Airplane was interested in grid puzzles that involve shapes and resolve to recognizable images, according to Nikoli president and puzzle creator Yoshinao Anpuku. He was also inspired by fractal art, or art involving geometric structures that repeat at small and large sizes. The resulting puzzle, Double Choco, isn’t quite fractal art, but the idea of repeated, connected shapes and patterns runs through it.

Airplane named the puzzle Double Chocolate, which was shortened slightly by the editors, in reference to dark and white chocolate. The two-color arrangement distinguishes puzzle grids from others in Nikoli’s pages, and often creates pleasing symmetries (as seen in Puzzle #3 below).


Solving a Double Choco involves reasoning at several levels. The goal is to divide the grid into blocks by drawing solid lines over the dotted lines. Each block must contain an equal number of white and gray cells, and those areas of white and gray must have the same form/shape. They can be rotated or mirrored to match one another. The numbers in the grid indicate the number of cells of that color in its block—or half the total cells in the block. A block can contain any number of cells with the number, or no number at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background
Medical Setting
Severe asthma that cannot be managed by noninvasive pharmacologic intervention is a serious quality of life issue for patients. Bronchial thermoplasty is an invasive treatment for such patients. It involves inserting a bronchoscope equipped with a device employing radio-frequency ablation to destroy some of the smooth muscle in the airway to allow the patient to breathe more freely. In order to run a rigorous randomized clinical trial (RCT) to unbiasedly determine the clinical effectiveness of thermoplasty it is necessary to randomize some patients to a sham procedure in which a bronchoscope is inserted without performing an intervention, but is manipulated in ways that are almost identical to a true ablation, and stays inserted the same amount of time.

Thank you for the updated index. Some minor things: in Definition 2.7.6 on p.93, should the general definition of the support be the set of points for which the stalk is not the *terminal* object, as opposed to the initial object? Something similar pops up in Exercise 2.7.H on the following page, where in the problem statement of part (a) we should be showing that the stalk (i_*F)_q for q outside Z is the singleton, as opposed to showing that it is the empty set, I think? Lastly, for notational consistency the adjoint pair referenced in Exercise 2.7.F on p.93 might instead be (\alpha^{-1}, \alpha_*), as opposed to (\alpha^*, \alpha_*)?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behind Myrtle Beach International Airport lies an old Air Force base that has been repurposed into a small park and memorial. And if you’re at all interested in planes, military history, or the history of Myrtle Beach, it’s a must-see on any trip to the beach. 

Available to view here are three former Air Force planes: an A-7D Corsair, an A-10 Warthog, and an F-100 Super Sabre. All three are on “static display”, meaning you unfortunately can’t watch them get airborne, but you can walk around them in all their glory, admiring every wing and panel from close proximity. All three were fighter aircraft used by the Air Force when it had a base here, which closed in 1993. The park also includes a Wall of Service, which lists the names of military and civilian personnel who were stationed at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base until it closed in 1993. 

While you can’t watch these jets in action, Warbird park is an excellent place to watch commercial planes take off at the nearby airport once you’ve snapped a few photos of the Warthog (a type of jet flown since 1976) and the Super Sabre (designed in the 1940s). While the park is small, it offers some shade in the form of trees, as well as picnic tables where you can enjoy lunch as you catch a few landings. There are also some walking paths leading from the park.]]></summary>

As a teenager in the 1980s, Pinkas spent a lot of time at his local mall and boardwalk arcades playing pinball, and his passion for the game never diminished. Soon, one office pinball game turned into two, and eventually he had so many that he began taking them home. Eventually, Pinkas learned how to repair these mazes of moving parts, from their plungers (those spring-loaded knobs that send the balls flying) to their switches, spinners, and stoppers. Then in 2018, he turned his collection into the Myrtle Beach Pinball Museum, an interactive display of retro history with one main goal: “to preserve pinball for what it really is: a nation…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He may be the youngest person to ever walk on the moon, but that doesn’t mean that astronaut Charles Duke has his head in the stars when it comes to remembering his South Carolina roots. 

Although born in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke’s family moved to South Carolina when he was around 10 or 11 and attended high school in Lancaster. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1957, Duke immediately became a 2nd Lieutenant in the Air Force and later earned a master’s in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT. In 1966 he applied to the Apollo program, and eventually became a part of NASA’s fifth group of astronauts. 

On April 20, 1972, Charles Duke took his first steps on the moon as part of the Apollo 16 mission. He was only 36-years-old, making him the youngest moon walker on earth. It’s a record that he still holds. Less than a year later, Duke also became the first inductee into the newly established South Carolina Hall of Fame, leaving his own moon boot footprints in cement in front of the Myrtle Beach Convention Center. 

“Moonprints” are easily recognizable by their wide soles and straight, thick ribs, and Duke’s look much like they did 50 years ago, thanks to mild weather and that they’re a bit off the beaten path. Along with the prints, there’s a plaque just beneath them reads: “These are the footprints of Astronaut Colonel Charles M. Duke, Jr., a native of South Carolina, who walked on the moon April 20, 1972, and the first inductee to the South Carolina Hall of Fame at its dedication on February 14, 1973.” 

Duke was the 10th out of 12 men to walk on the moon during the Apollo program’s six missions (which took place between July 1969 and December 1972), and spent 71 hours on its surface as a lunar module pilot of Apollo 16. While there, he collected a record 210 pounds of lunar rock samplings. 

Another fun fact: During that same mission, Duke left a photo of himself, his wife, and his two sons on the moon’s surface, and it’s still there today.]]></summary>

It was also the spot to be along Carver Street in Myrtle Beach’s Booker T. Washington neighborhood—a bastion of Black American history. 

Black entrepreneur Charlie Fitzgerald and his wife Sarah opened Charlie’s Place as a supper club in 1937, and it soon became a space for not only Black performers, but also for Black patrons to come and hear incredible music (often alongside whites) while temporarily escaping the oppressiveness of the era.

While some family empires are built on oil or manufacturing, the Plylers built theirs on souvenirs.

This nearly 80-year-old establishment bills itself as the nation’s largest gift shop, and at 35,000 square feet, with nearly 70,000 items (at least as of 2011), it would be hard to argue.

The shop first sprang to life in 1946 when Buz’s parents, Justin and Elise opened a little gift shop. They wanted a “whimsical nautical name” for the store, Plyler told the Sun-News in 2001. And the Gay Dolphin was born. Though Hurricane Hazel, a Category 4…]]></summary>

Not only is he the quintessential car collector, assembling his collection of American cars and trucks for over 50 years, but he’s also a collector of classic cars. And he has more than 150 of them. Each of these vintage beauties is a celebration of the car-making culture that built America. 

 

It started simply enough when Cummings’s father bought him a 1940 Ford. That gift spurred a lifelong love of cars. “Collecting cars has been my life’s passion,” Cummings told Myrtle Beach’s Sun News in 2009. Over the years, that passion revealed itself in a cadre of cars stored in “barns, chicken sheds, old warehouses and any other place he could find.” What this passion needed was a central location.

I have a history of working on MCMC methods. These permit you to sample a posterior pdf when you only know a function  that is related to your posterior pdf by some unknown normalization constant. Similarly, diffusion lets you sample from a pdf when you only know the gradient of . Again, you don't need the normalization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even in the mini golf capital of the world, Mt. Atlanticus Minotaur Goff stands out, in part for its size. The two mini golf courses here offer a beautiful view of the Atlantic—hence the name, which conjures up a Mount Olympus on the shores of South Carolina. And indeed, you’ll feel like a god of leisure while hitting a colorful golf ball along the faux caves, islands, and fields here. The complex even includes a now-defunct department store, which has been retrofitted to feel like a mini golf grotto.

Mt. Atlanticus is a must-visit in the Myrtle Beach area, especially if you’re visiting with family or children. The courses include plenty of benches for waiting in case you’ve found yourself here on a warm summer night when the course is packed with golfers. 

You’ll also find a pond with koi fish, a bubbling pool labeled the “miraculous fountain of youth,” a waterfall, and plenty of (plastic) mystical creatures appearing from the water. (For the shopping-inclined, there’s also an extensively stocked gift shop.) Both courses have a bonus 19th hole, where a hole in one will win you free mini golf for life. But even if you can’t sink your final ball, you’ll have a blast here.]]></summary>

But while you should stop to look at the marker, you shouldn’t stop there—there’s a lot of history and culture to explore in Atlantic Beach. 

This town’s history dates back to 1934, when George Tyson, a local Black entrepreneur, bought 47 beachfront acres for $12,000, and formed the Atlantic Beach Company with 10 others, which became the town’s first governing body. Tyson soon opened the Black Hawk Night Club, and the area became a popular destination for Black tourists who were not able to visit other nearby beach towns thanks to segregation. Alongside the night club opened motels, shops, and restaurants. Since its founding, the area has had close ties to th…]]></summary>

This natural alleyway of breathtaking live oak (Quercus virginiana) trees—planted in the 1700s—is part of a 9,127-acre natural and cultivated landscape that’s considered the “floral jewel of South Carolina’s coast,” and are considered a work of art in themselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Monument to the Victims of the Sajmište Concentration Camp can be found on on the left bank of the river Sava.

The memorial is to honor the  Jewish women and children who were held at the Sajmište concentration camp from 1941 to 1942. During that period, some 10,000 Serbs, 7,000 Jews, and at least 60 Roma died at the concentration camp. The people who were imprisoned there were kept in squalid conditions in makeshift barracks. They were only provided with limited rations, with many victims starving and freezing to death during the winter of 1941–42.

The death camp was founded on the former trade fair grounds located near Zemun. It was operated by SS Einsatgruppen units stationed in Serbia. 

These victims of the Holocaust held in Sajmište Concentration Camp were murdered in gas vans during the spring of 1942. When the gassings were complete, the area was renamed as Zemun Concentration Camp. It then served to hold one last group of Jews arrested when Italy surrendered in September 1943.]]></summary>

On that spring night in Pickett CCC Memorial State Park on the Cumberland Plateau, about two-and-a-half hours northeast of Nashville, Tennessee, we weren’t looking at actual worms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the night of January 29, 1893, in what is now downtown Curitiba, a young woman named Maria da Conceição Bueno was brutally murdered by her possessive lover, Ignácio José Diniz, a low-ranking soldier. Diniz slashed Bueno’s throat and stabbed her several times. News of the shocking crime spread throughout the city.

A cross was allegedly placed at the murder site. Soon after, legend has it that red roses sprung from the cross, nurtured by the blood of the murder’s victim. With this Maria Bueno’s reputation as a miracle worker was born. 

Maria Bueno didn’t become notorious until after her death. Little is known about her for a fact, but there is no shortage of narratives on who she was and how she lived. Most versions state that she worked as a laundress. By some accounts, she was a sex worker. By others, she was a formerly enslaved Black woman whose image has been whitened along the decades—depictions of her, including the life-size statue at her grave, usually show her as a white woman.

To her devotees, Bueno’s life story is not as important as the miracles she reputedly performs. Her grave is surrounded by a myriad of stone signs and metal plates brought by believers to thank the local martyr for her help in matters like getting a job or beating an illness. Flowers, ribbons, and figurines are among other tokens of devotion that can be found in the little chapel by the grave. 

For many locals, Maria Bueno holds the status of a saint. She is often referred to as Santinha de Curitiba (Curitiba’s Little Saint, or Dear Saint). So far, the Catholic Church hasn’t acknowledged her as such. In any case, the cult of Bueno is not exclusive to Catholics. She is also popular with followers of other faiths, especially Spiritualism and Umbanda, an Afro-Brazilian religion. Regardless of religious affiliations, though, Maria Bueno lives on in the collective imagination of the city as one of its most intriguing figures.]]></summary>

At first glance, the people mover at George Bush Intercontinental Airport known as the "Subway" doesn't look like much, nothing quite resemblant to a metro system one might expect in a city. But an avid fan of Disney World may notice its similarity to PeopleMover, an attraction in Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland, which the Subway shares much of its mechanical technology with.

The Subway first opened in 1969 along with the airport, but was replaced by a new underground train system that utilizes the WEDWay system, developed by what was then known as WED Transportation Systems, a division within the Walt Disney Company responsible for the design and construction of the rides at Disney parks. This should make the Subway a rare example of a Disney ride outside Disney parks, at least in spirit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In November 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland along the border from the Arctic Sea to the Gulf of Finland. The assault began without a proper declaration of war—the Soviet Union seemingly hoped their invasion of Finland would be as easy as those in the nearby Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This was the start of the Winter War.

Although the Soviet Union forces greatly outnumbered them, the Finns actually successfully managed to repel the Soviet Union forces and then retained most of its territory when the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in 1940.

This sculpture stands in front of the army headquarters in Helsinki as a national memorial to the Winter War. It is the creation of Pekka Kauhanen, and has stood at Kasarmitori in Kaartinkaupunki since November 2017.  President Martti Ahtisaari unveiled the sculpture on the 78th anniversary of the Winter War.
The spherical base of the sculpture contains 105 photographs that highlight the events of the Winter War.  The visibility of the images, however, is not always what was initially imagined. Since the unveiling, it has been plagued by moisture, which condenses on the inside of the circular windows and impairs the visibility of the photographs inside.

The memorial is an expression of appreciation for the valuable input of veterans and everyone else who participated in the war efforts from the Finnish people. The memorial was designed to commemorate the more than 25,000 Finns who gave their lives for their country during the Winter War.]]></summary>

With millions of Americans out of pocket due to the Great Depression, board games were one of the cheapest forms of entertainment. One of the most popular games of the decade was Monopoly—no doubt precisely because it allowed players to imagine themselves getting rich and powerful.


Like Monopoly, but the Exact Opposite

One board game from the early 1930s was Monopoly’s diametrical opposite. Instead of celebrating capitalism, it aimed to destroy it. The players’ goal is to get rid of the rich and powerful, end oppression, and seize the means of production. Ultimately, their actions will turn the USA into the USSA—the United Soviet States of America.

        <updated>2023-08-18T00:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of 2023, Iceland is one of the few countries that still allows whaling—the hunting of whales (mainly) for food or oil. Fin whales and minke whales are the prime targets, the former for export and the latter for domestic consumption. In Iceland, public opinion on this practice is divided. The juxtaposition of commercial vs environmental motivations is further complicated by at least two other factors. On the one hand, the whale-watching industry is thriving, which obviously benefits from protecting whales. However, on the other hand, many Icelanders make a living in the herring fishing industry, which is adversely affected by large numbers of whales.

If opinion is divided in Iceland, there is no shortage of international organizations advocating a wholesale ban on whaling. Among them is the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which in 1986 orchestrated the sabotage of the whaling station in Hvalfjörður and sank two whaling vessels in the process, Hvalur 6 RE-376 and Hvalur 7 RE-377. Built in 1946, these two twin vessels had been in the Icelandic whaling fleet since 1961. A few days after the sinking, these vessels were recovered and towed to shore in Hvalfjörður, where they still are to this day.

Hvalfjörður translates as “whale fjord.” Traditional folklore maintains that early settlers spotted a pod of whales in these waters and named the fjord after it. A rival explanation is that the name originates from the presence of a large whale station (or more) in the fjord. To this day, Hvalfjörður is home to the only active whale station in Iceland.

The vessels, commonly referred to as the Beached Whalers, are safely anchored to the shore—side by side, as if they were the mirror image of each other. They are connected to heating and electricity, but damages caused by salt water and years of exposure to the elements were never repaired. Needless to say, they never went whale hunting again. Climbing on board is forbidden.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked away off the main road just west of Luwingu, Zambia, is a small waterfall called Lufubu Falls.   

A gently-flowing stream flows clear through some minor drops and tumbles before going around a gentle bend and then crashing over an immense stone structure before returning to its quiet flow. There have been a few structures built on the top, but they are mostly now in ruins. Teens will often gather here and sometimes churches will use the clear waters above the falls for baptisms, but rarely do outsiders visit this serene location.  

From the dirt parking area, you can hear the falls but due to heavy vegetation, you cannot see them. A short walk down some rock face will allow you a more clear view. The mist feels cool on a hot day and the mild roar is pleasant and peaceful.

Before she passed away, Elizabeth pointed her accusations at a local woman, Goody Garlick. Garlick was not well-liked by the townspeople, and soon after the accusation was made, the people would gather and speak of other evils potentially caused by the “witch.” 

Elizabeth’s father, Lion Gardiner, who was the first settler of the town and respected by all, determined Goody would be tried in Connecticut. This was done to attempt to ensure that Goody had a fair trial. The Connecticut court determined that Goody Garlick was not guilty of witchcraft. 

She returned to East Hampton, where she would live the remainder of her days as a free woman. The remains of Lion Gardiner and Goody Garlick are interred at South End Cemetery in East Hampton.]]></summary>

The story begins with Melvin “Tubby” Miller, who was born in Portis on May 6, 1900. After graduating high school, he changed his name to Melvin Millar, thinking it sounded more unique. Tubby Millar attended the Kansas City Art Institute, where he met and befriended Isadore “Friz” Freleng. Both students soon moved to Hollywood, attracted by a fellow Kansas City Art Institute graduate named Walt Disney. 

Freleng would get a job at Leon Schlesinger Productions, the studio behind popular shorts Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies. He rose to lead director, and created the character of Porky Pig. Porky Pig was an insta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, for our second photo contest of the year, we called out to all the night owls for their most memorable views after dark. At Atlas Obscura, we love reasons to stay up past our bedtimes and experience celestial moments that leave us in awe. We wanted to know: What do you see when the sun goes down?
We were dazzled by the beautiful nocturnal imagery our readers submitted. We saw landscapes gently reflecting moonlight, trails of stars etched into velvet skies, and dreamy views from windows. The most popular feature in the entries, by far, was the Milky Way in all its glory.
Behold our wonderful winning photos (view them up close with a click) selected by our staff—the first place winner is above. We hope they will inspire you to look up and around more often when darkness descends.
Congratulations to our winners, who scored some Atlas Obscura gear!

Its stone walls are painted white, its wooden floors are polished, and its banquettes are a dark gray that matches the tall, round columns supporting the room’s elegant cross-vault ceiling. The pillars and arched ceiling give the restaurant a distinctly religious atmosphere, but the original building—erected in 1858—was never frequented by churchgoers. It housed cows.

Rheinhessen’s history of intensive agriculture and viticulture stretches back to the ancient Roman era. After the agricultural revolution of the 18th century, farmers decided to increase their cattle’s yield by keeping them in stables and using their manure to fertilize their arable cr…]]></summary>

In 2019, an international team of researchers mounted camera traps at two fresh elephant carcasses—what the authors call “carrion bonanzas”—in Tsavo East National Park. In their recent study in the journal Science Direct, they compare the death of an elephant in the park’s dry landscape to a whale fall (when a dead cetacean sinks to the bottom of the ocean), a feast that can support or even create a whole ecological community. Over a month of recording they saw the usual suspects of predators and scavengers take turns at the carcass th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, the only way to try Maria Piedad Cano’s famed arepas was to roam along Roosevelt Avenue well after dark and hope for good fortune. Cano was a lawyer and a judge in her homeland of Colombia, but after she fled to the United States, she turned to wielding a mobile griddle. In 1993, The New York Press dubbed her the “Saintly Arepa Lady” and the name stuck. 

Like many of New York City’s street vendors, Cano lived a precarious existence for decades. From 1983 through 2021, the city enforced a strict cap on the number of street vendor permits, leaving vendors struggling to either dodge the police or pay as much as $20,000 for permits on the black market. Cano was finally able to set up a brick-and-mortar location in Elmhurst in 2014, only to be forced to move once again when a developer demolished her building to make way for apartments. 

At long last, Cano was able to reopen in 2018, along with her son Alejandro Osorio, who runs the current iteration of the restaurant. Arepa Lady currently has three branches, but the Jackson Heights outpost feels closest to Cano’s roots. 

The arepas are as good as ever, particularly when crowned with a tangle of carne desmechada, slow-braised beef, or fat slices of chorizo. Order an arepa de queso, a plump corn cake oozing cheese from the interior, of an arepa de choclo, which comes folded over fillings like a diner-style omelet. Although carnivorous toppings dominate the menu, don’t sleep on the vegetarian offering—the trifecta of black beans, avocado, and sticky sweet plantains showered with grated cheese is outstanding.]]></summary>

The consistency is somewhere between a tomato soup and a curry gravy, with a pleasant, slow-building burn. It’s the perfect foil for the rich, slightly filling of goat meat—although these dumplings also come stuffed with paneer, potatoes, beef, and all manner of other fillings. 

With large Tibetan and Nepalese communities, Jackson Heights is the place to go for all sorts of regional styles of momos. By the time sibling duo Yamuna Shrestha and Shree Shrestha opened up their small restaurant in the shadow of the 7 train, the neighborhood already had a wealth of excellent options. Yet the Shresthas, who hail from just west of Kathmandu, still made a name for themselves, scoring the winning spot multiple years in a row on the informal neighborhood Momo Crawl. 

While an order of jhol momo belongs on every table, there are plenty of other heavy-hitters on the menu of Nepalese specialties. Both the thali and the samay baji sets offer solo diners the chance to try a range of dishes, all accompanied by chutney and brightly acidic pickles. Order one or two sel roti, chewy, crushed-rice doughnuts meant for dunking in a tangy, fiery dipping sauce, for the table. Head to the back of the restaurant to refill your cup with warmly spiced masala chai from the insulated container.]]></summary>

You can feel the history seep through the walls of this public house. The low, beamed ceilings, dark wooden furniture and stone hearth fireplace are cozy and inviting. At the same time, you can almost sense the ghosts of patrons past seated next to you as you sip ale out of a metal cup.  

Like so many pubs, The Lamb Inn offers the traditional Sunday roast of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, roasted veggies, and potatoes. But, Sunday Roast at The Lamb Inn is next level. This particular rendition of the classic is next-level, with generous portions and a heap of cheesy cauliflower included.]]></summary>

It is the use of multiple processors to perform tasks in parallel by a single computer program. I have known this simple fact for over thirty years, but funnily enough I never explored it in practice. The reason is fundamentally that I am a physicist, not a computer scientist, and as a physicist I tend to stick with a known skillset to solve my problems, and to invest time in more physics knowledge than software wizardry. You might well say I am not a good programmer altogether, although that would secretly cause me pain. I would answer that while it is certainly true that my programs are ugly and hard to read, they do what they are supposed to do, as proven by a certain record of scientific publications. <br/><p><a href="https://www.science20.com/tommaso_dorigo/multithreading_for_dummies-256741" target="_blank">read more</a></p></div></div>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From 1810 to 1823, Jean Lafitte and his brother Pierre were among the most notorious and successful privateers in the Americas. Like many great pirates, Jean Lafitte's exact origins are shrouded in mystery, but he is believed to be born either in France or one of its Caribbean colony Saint-Domingue (now called Haiti) and he had a spectacular reputation for drinking, womanizing, and debauchery.

An equal-opportunity spy and smuggler, Lafitte lent his skills in military endeavors from the War of 1812 to the Mexican War of Independence. At various points, he worked for the British, U.S., and Spanish armies. He supposedly died in 1823—an event many scholars later believed to be a ruse. 

In fact, according to local researchers in Lincolnton, North Carolina, believe that the buccaneer staged his own death, changed his name to Lorenzo Ferrer, then enjoyed a quiet life free from the prying eyes of law enforcement until his actual death in 1875. He is believed to be resting peacefully in the cemetery at St. Luke’s Episcopal Church.]]></summary>

The hot springs are a few hundred yards from the beach along a jungle stream. While you soak, you can make your own mud mask from the sulfurous clay by the river. Massage and other spa services are also offered at the spring. The small admission fee and restaurant support the nearby school and other community services.

There are trails throughout the picturesque landscape of Tiské Stěny, which contains the towering sandstone rock formations. If you set out from the Church of Saint Anne (also known as Kostel sv.Anny), two trails lead up into the hills: one, a shorter jaunt to your left, and the other, a longer trail to your right. The shorter hike, despite its less daunting length, is still challenging, and unfortunately, neither trail is wheelchair-accessible.To access either hike, you need to purchase entry tickets…]]></summary>

The Good Friday Earthquake, as it’s sometimes called since it occurred two days before Easter, swiftly buckled the ground underneath, leaving a craggy, unrecognizable landscape. The neighborhood known as Turnagain Heights slid into the ocean, while some of the largest buildings in the city, including JC Penney, were demolished. Tsunamis that followed the 9.2-magnitude quake caused waves up to 20 stories high and wreaked havoc on the region.

One of just two sites in the U.S. that tested live missiles, and the only one of eight launch sites still standing in Alaska, the Nike Site is accessible by tour atop Mount Gordon Lyon, on the eastern edge of present-day Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER). 

In the years following World War II, mounting tensions between the Soviet Union and the west posed the threat of nuclear war. The U.S. Army responded by implementing an anti-aircraft missile defense system to interc…]]></summary>

A long time ago, when humans lived in large communal groups, following big game and taking shelter in caves, we weren’t sure what the stars were. But the stars mattered a great deal all the same. The earliest human art, painted on cave walls around the world, depicts both animals and objects in the sky, and often the seasonal connections between them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sculpture of Dena’ina matriarch Olga Nicolai Ezi, known affectionately as “Grandma Olga,” stands proudly next to a bronze fish-drying rack in the Ship Creek Small Boat Harbor near downtown Anchorage.

Located along the banks of Ship Creek, a still-thriving urban salmon fishery, the bronze sculpture is part of a larger public art installation honoring this well-respected Dena’ina leader, her family, and their native customs. The Dena’ina were the original inhabitants of this south-central part of Alaska, and the only coastal Athabascan tribe. 

Small in stature, but highly influential, Olga Nicolai was born in 1875 in the Tyone Lake, Copper Center regions, where her father was a noted medicine man. In 1896, Olga married Simeon Ezi, one of the last chiefs of the upper Cook Inlet. 

Credited with much of the tribal lineage, the couple and their five children lived in the Native Village of Eklutna and took pride in the Indigenous customs—fishing in summer and hunting and trapping in the fall and winter. The family also operated a small boating business, shipping supplies from Anchorage to nearby villages. 

Dena’ina artist and University of Alaska Fairbanks graduate Joel Isaak sculpted the installation, called One’s Spirit, over roughly two and a half years. The artist spent months talking with Alaska Natives about their unique features and customs, which shows in his detailed metal work. Olga’s shoes, for example, would have been made of fish scales. The artist mimicked that unique texture in his work. The statue was officially unveiled in January 2019.

In all, the Grandma Olga section of the installation includes the elder, a fish trap and rack, and bronze salmon lying on the concrete. Plaques nearby detail her contributions and those of the Dena’ina people. The surrounding area’s stunning coastal views and scenery make it worth a visit, too.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On 26 acres of serene woodlands, six life-sized Native dwellings pepper the banks of Lake Tiulana on the campus of the Alaska Native Heritage Center. Opened in 1999, the center, which was built on Native Dena'ina Ełnena land, is located 7 miles east of downtown Anchorage and honors the lasting legacy of Alaska’s major culture groups.

Start the journey inside with an introductory film, “Stories Given, Stories Shared,” for a quick background on Alaska’s Native people. Then, watch as Native artists produce live works on a stroll through the Hall of Cultures. Vibrant wooden posts, moose-hide boots, bark baskets, seal-skin tunics, intricate beadwork, and other Native art fill the exhibit rooms. 

The Gathering Place serves as center stage for Native song and dance demonstrations, plus traditional games and storytelling. Outside, duck in and out of replica log cabins and underground cave-like structures that resemble ancient Native dwellings, and soak in the ways and customs of these close-knit, resilient communities. Culture bearers share stories and historic artifacts to help paint a picture of what life is and was like for Eyak, Yup’ik, and Athabascan peoples, among others. 

In April 2022, the center received over 1,700 additional artifacts, including baskets, ivory figurines, carvings, a qayaq, the coat of an Athabascan chief, and more from the Wells Fargo Alaska Heritage Library and Museum, a gift that nearly doubled the center’s existing collection.

One notable relic, a full-scale whale skeleton outside, illustrates the importance of the whaling industry to provide clothing, oil, tools, and sustenance to the northernmost coastal peoples.]]></summary>

In 1858, he graduated from the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and shortly thereafter went to work for Danish architect Theophil Hansen.

Between them, they designed Athens University, the National Library of Greece, the National Observatory of Athens, the National and Capodistrian University of Athens, the Academy of Athens, and several other significant buildings.

Instead of continually teaching special case statistical tests, I prefer to teach general models that include tests as special cases. For the usual cross-sectional or longitudinal layouts this is quite standard. But for paired data, practitioners are not so used to seeing a model-based approach.
For paired data from a bivariate normal distribution, or for within-pair differences having a normal distribution, the paired -test is a standard procedure. BBR discussed how easy it is to get the same answer as the paired -test using either an ordinary linear model blocking on subject or using a mixed effects model with random intercepts for subjects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In her debut book, No Meat Required: The Cultural History & Culinary Future of Plant-Based Eating, Alicia Kennedy has written a manifesto—but, crucially, not a diatribe. More than half a century after Diet for a Small Planet—Frances Moore Lappé’s influential work on the need to reduce animal consumption—Kennedy makes a case for radically rethinking the place of meat in our warming world.

She has no intention of convincing all of her readers to go vegan or to adhere to the kind of moral puritanism with which the movement has often been wrongly associated. Instead, she takes an incisive look at the good, the bad, and the bizarre across the history of abstaining from meat, from religious sects to raw vegans, from toxic wellness culture to Silicon Valley–backed lab-grown meats.

Businesses shuttered throughout the winter and spring reopen to sell food and souvenirs as people explore the county’s cherry orchards and state parks. At Northport, at the tip of the peninsula, ferries run between the mainland and Washington Island, crossing a channel French sailors nicknamed Porte des Morts or “Death’s Door” for the large number of shipwrecks swept up in the currents.

But right before arriving at Death’s Door, travelers are thrown for a curve—or fifteen to be more specific. An unusually twisty stretch of Highway 42, built in the early 1930s, has baffled visitors for decades. Who designed this surreal stretch of road?

This storied door in Westminster Abbey comprises five vertical oak planks held together with three horizontal battens and iron straps. Most unusually the battens are recessed into the planks so that the door is flush on both sides.  In 2005, the door was dated using a process known as dendrochronology. A study showed that the wood was felled after 1032 and the door itself was constructed sometime in the 1050s, during the reign of King Edward the Confessor.

For its age, this door inspires us to look as good as we grow on in years. Don’t be among those who come for the famous crypts and then miss the door.]]></summary>

On the bronze plaque at the rear of the statue is a curious circle of bees, all facing the queen in the center: the bees represent the state of Florence as an industrious community ruled by the grand duke. 

The plaque has acquired a local legend. Some say that it is impossible to count the number of bees using only your eyes. Because of the irregular concentric arrangement, those who try will always lose count—said to be a deliberate trick on the part of the grand duke and the sculptor, Pietro Tacca, who finished the statue started by his teacher, Giambologna. (There are a total of 91 bees depicted on the plaque.)]]></summary>

The statue was unveiled in 1992, 30 years after her death in 1962. It depicts Monroe sitting down with her legs crossed, with one of her iconic high-heeled shoes laying next to her. She is wearing a neat dress, and is staring over her shoulder. It was created by Nils Aas, a famous Norwegian sculptor, who also designed a few of the Norwegian krone coins.]]></summary>

Housed in a renovated warehouse, the unique cultural center is home to tens of thousands of used books, including such rarities as independent publications, antiquarian books, and donations from celebrities, as well as a large number of English-language books. All were collected from 25 indie bookshops around Seoul. The shelves are organized by the sellers, each of them maintaining its own cataloging system, cloning a smaller-scale version of it within the microcosm of the repository.

While its library-like selection of books is excellent on its own, not to mention photogenic with all the rainbows created by the colorful book spines, many of the visitors to the repository are after something else: Instagrammable photo opportunities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of people are saying that the indictments of Donald Trump have had the perverse effect of increasing his support among Republicans--for example, in the New York Times, Rich Lowry says "it’s not that he’s winning despite the indictments; it’s almost as though he’s winning because of the indictments."  The main piece of evidence is that his lead in the polls about the Republican nomination have increased since about the time he started getting indicted (the first was on March 30).   But is that because he's become more popular, or because his leading opponent--Ron DeSantis--has become less popular?  I looked for polls asking people if they had a favorable or unfavorable view of Ron DeSantis.  The figure shows percent favorable minus percent unfavorable for all of the surveys that are available:


It's hard to say what was happening through mid-2022, since three surveys taken within a few days of each other in July 2022 gave very different results.  However, if we start in September 2022, there's a clear pattern--first a rise until late 2022/early 2023, and then a decline.  The fact that the recent decline has been so steady suggests that it's not the result of any single factor.  Whatever the cause, it suggests that Trump's increasing lead may be because DeSantis is getting less popular, not because Trump is getting more popular.  

These results are all from general national samples, not samples of Republicans.  I would limit it to Republicans if I could, but the breakdowns aren't available for most of the surveys.  However, it's safe to say that very few Democrats have ever had favorable views of him, so that the changes are almost entirely among Republicans and independents.   
Of course, there are also surveys about favorable vs. unfavorable views of Trump--the reason I looked at DeSantis first is that there aren't as many about him, so it's a more manageable job.  I'll look at changes in approval of Trump in a future post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Within the second-largest of Michigan's state parks resides the second-largest waterfall east of the Mississippi: Tahquamenon Falls. ("Tahquamenon" rhymes with "phenomenon.") The falls are actually a series—the largest of which, called the Upper Falls, stretches 200 feet wide and 48 feet high. Downriver of the Upper Falls you can find the Lower Falls, a series of five waterfalls cascading around a rowboat-accessible island.

The falls were first made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's "The Song of Hiawatha," in which the main character Hiawatha builds his canoe "by the rushing Tahquamenaw." Long before white men like Longfellow set eyes on the falls, however, it was long-used as a hunting and fishing site by the Ojibwa natives. Then, in the 1800s the river was used by loggers who used its current like a highway to transport timber harvested from deep in Michigan's upper peninsula to mills along the riverbank. 

The trademark brown, cola-like color of the river is due to tannic acid absorbed from the surrounding cedar trees. Because of the color fo the water, this feature is known to some as "Root Beer Falls."

More recently, the falls made an appearance on Sufjan Steven's 2003 album Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State in the form of a song title.]]></summary>

Over 250 dinosaur footprints await you, along with crocodile scratches, and other trace fossils belying the ancient ecosystem.

Dinosaur Ridge offers visitors the chance to view and touch actual dinosaur tracks and dinosaur bones dating back to the Jurassic period. These tracks were first discovered in 1937 during the construction of the West Alameda Parkway.

Clues to unlock the past come in all sorts of shapes and sizes along the 2-mile round-trip trail, culminating in one of the most significant dinosaur bone quarries in North America, where Stegosaurus was first identified, and important research is still ongoing. Interpretive tours are available (and recommended!) with expert guides. Dig into the prehistory of this geologic and paleontologic wonder. The park offers full guided walking and bus tours, as well as a self-guided audio tour.]]></summary>

My expectations were low as I drove back to the rental house and started looking at the sample through my microscope. Then I screamed.

The pieces of grass were coated with slimy brown film, and within it I saw a tiny, teardrop-shaped scaly cell wall with curved blue-green structures inside.

Our podcast is an audio guide to the world’s wondrous, awe-inspiring, strange places. In under 15 minutes, we’ll take you to an incredible site, and along the way you’ll meet some fascinating people and hear their stories.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inaugurated in 2019, the eye-catching artwork 'Listen' in the center of Umeå depicts a roaring muscular feline sitting atop an almost cage-like steel structure 10 feet (3 meters) above the ground. The animal sculpture, which has an open gap filled with golden bronze, is made of polyester composite with Mazda red lacquer on the surface.

This permanent public installation symbolizes the Municipality of Umeå's official stance against sexual harassment. It's also the first monument in Sweden entirely dedicated to the social MeToo movement. While the formal name of the artwork is 'Listen,' locals call it "the MeToo cougar."

The sculpture was created by Swedish artist Camilla Akraka (who is the sister to former Olympic athletics star Maria Akraka). She has described her installation as "conservative aesthetics of power that meets a story of liberation," referring not only to the MeToo awareness campaign but also to the monument's contrasts between the free organic feline and the traditional powerful material qualities such as steel, car paint, and gold.

When the €50,000 artwork was erected, it faced opposition from some local politicians who argued that allocating funds for what they perceived as "political art" was wasteful, particularly in light of recent education budget cuts. Even some feminists expressed concerns over the monument, viewing the representation of a cougar as "objectifying" towards women. However, the artist defended her work, emphasizing that the animal sculpture was never intended to be species-specific.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In modern vampire lore, the process for becoming undead typically involves a darkly romantic setting, a fang-y bite, and a long, dramatic drink from the neck. But that’s the result of the last hundred years or so of vampire stories. In post-medieval Poland, undead evil was far more banal and less elegant; it was believed to possess the souls of those who had the misfortune to die early in epidemics, by suicide, or simply before being baptized. So when it came time to bury these poor souls, care was taken to ensure they would not provide an easy vessel for a malicious, supernatural force.

In late July 2023, archaeologists working on a 17th-century cemetery outside the southeastern Polish village of Pień excavated the remains of a child who appeared to have been interred in the period's "a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nevada and the rest of the West were generally crisscrossed by stagecoach lines during the latter 19th century and even into the early 20th. It was a dusty, difficult, time-consuming, and an uncomfortable way to travel—but if there was no railroad, there were few alternatives.

Many of these old lines were ephemeral, with little trace left today. Other routes are now followed by modern highways. In a surprising number of cases, however, the line persisted for a decade or more, but the route is still about as remote as it was back when the stages were thundering. Sometimes the original destinations became ghost towns. Sometimes the modern highway takes a route that was impractical in the old days, through being too steep for horse-drawn vehicles, or simply being too expensive for the resources at the time, as by requiring prohibitive amounts of excavation, or bridges that were beyond the state of engineering.

Pritchard's station lies on one of these abandoned routes. It was on the Belmont-Tybo-Eureka stage line from the 1870s into the 1880s. It even had a post office briefly in 1874. The ruin consists of a sturdy building with stone block walls on the outside, the remnants of a wooden roof, and some dilapidated interior wooden walls. Although a few foundations, probably from stables and pens, also occur just north of the station, it now appears as an incongruous lone building out in the desert.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chaekgeori is a unique genre of still-life painting that flourished during the Joseon dynasty of Korea, especially under the reign of Emperor Jeongjo (1776-1800). Typically, it depicts bookshelves full of “books and things” (chaekgeori), a pleasant eye candy to bibliophiles of all ages.

It was also a thematic inspiration behind the Gyeongui Line Book Street project in the Mapo district, intended to be a multipurpose cultural hub utilizing books to enrich people’s lives. Another inspiration was the Hongdae neighborhood surrounding it, an area with a high concentration of publishers in the past.

The vibrant Book Street runs for nearly four miles along Gyeongui Line, on the disused railroad tracks converted into a scenic promenade. It’s home to fourteen bookshops specializing in different themes and genres, all housed in train-shaped booths.

The promenade, a popular haunt among locals, also boasts a collection of book-themed public artworks, such as the statue of a girl standing on a library ladder and picking a book from the shelf.

Hip, refined, and relatively peaceful, Book Street is an intellectual oasis in the metropolitan hubbub of Seoul, perfect for solo walks, cute dates, or simple biblio-shopping.]]></summary>

Due to the changing economic and social landscape in Italy in the 1960s, many puppeteers abandoned their careers for something more lucrative. The association opened the museum with the goal of rejuvenating the puppetry scene in Sicily.

The museum houses a wide range of puppets, including the largest and most complete collection of pupi from the Sicilian-based Opera dei Pupi, a  marionette theatrical representation of Frankish romantic poems that dates back to the early 1800s. Other exhibits include puppets from all parts of the globe, including Japan, Thailand, Congo, Java, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and more.

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[RT by @ZoubinGhahrama1: Pale Blue Dot is a photo of Earth that was taken by the Voyager 1 space probe in 1990 from a distance of about 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles) as it was leaving our solar system. This is what Carl Sagan said about the photo:

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”]]></title>

What is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? 

One is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. 

Similarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.]]></title>
