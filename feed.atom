        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Close to the border between Yokohama and the historic city of Kamakura lies an esoteric network of tunnels and vaulted chambers adorned with Buddhist reliefs. Commonly referred to as the Taya Caves, the Yugadō ("yoga grotto") of Jōsen-ji Temple is a fascinating mystery, rich in history and ambiance.

Believed to be the site of an ancient burial cave, the Yugadō predates the temple itself, whose origin can be traced back to 1532. The tunnels were dug in the early Kamakura period (circa 1185-1333) and used as a place for ascetic training by Buddhist monks of the esoteric Mantra Sect.

Many of the mystical reliefs were carved by the monks as they meditated and prayed to reach enlightenment. Decorating the high vaults and the sandstone walls of the narrow passages are images of Buddhist deities, mythological creatures, and Sanskrit characters, some crumbling but otherwise preserved in good condition.

When an earthquake hit the area at some point in the Edo period (1603-1868), some of the vaulted ceilings collapsed and the Taya Caves lay deserted for many decades, until local villagers started to draw the spring water from them for their rice paddies around 1830. Inspired, the monks also resumed their ascetic practice in the spiritual confinement.

The spring water, locally known as the Otonashi-gawa (“soundless river”), runs throughout the intricate web of caves and cascades down some of the walls. In the sacred chamber dedicated to the stone effigy of the great monk Kūkai, the serene flow is given the name of the Diamond Water, rich in healing and wish-granting properties.

Since 1927, the grottoes have been open to the public, and the monks also continue their practice of asceticism in this esoteric dungeon to this day. Carrying a candle in hand, visitors can explore the ancient tunnels and the chambers, each of which stands in for a major sacred site across Japan; by the time you exit, you’ll have completed a good old Buddhist pilgrimage and cleansed your soul and body.]]></summary>

Located within a rural and picturesque area of Grafton, Massachusetts, the museum is housed within an old red farm homestead originally built in 1718. It was here that the Willard brothers Benjamin, Simon, Ephraim, and Aaron dedicated their lives to both farming and clockmaking. Out of all the brothers, Simon became the most famous being the inventor of the eight-day patent timepiece which later came to be known as the banjo clock, and for also …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here you can see almost every species of rattlesnake in the United States, including a few from Mexico. Along with a few local insects, arachnids, skinks, and even Gila monsters.

Jeffery Ross, known as "Buzz," had a lifelong love of reptiles and big dreams to match. As the former supervisor of the reptile house at the Fort Worth Zoo, Buzz had a yearning to move out to West Texas in the Davis mountains. He moved to Fort Davis and went into taxidermy with a partner. After he bought his partner out, the business, shop, and a parcel of land were his.

The property has a long history. His shop had been a market and general store. Behind it is an adobe-and-rock motel, used during the days of horse-drawn wagons, that closed in 1953. In between the two, there was even a 1,400-square-foot house, which became handy for keeping a few extra snakes.

Ross had long dreamed of opening a rattlesnake museum. He already had the snakes, most of which he caught himself, so one mad day in April 2000, Ross rashly cashed in his investments and began renovating the taxidermy shop and started working on snake displays, with the help of a friend named Scott Tepes. He started with four snakes—today there are over 30. The Houston Chronicle once described it as "the funkiest roadside attraction west of the Pecos."

Sadly, Ross passed away in May 2018. He passed the museum on to his longtime friend Scott Tepes, a snake expert in his own right. Given Ross's eclectic nature, Tepes had a lot of work to do cleaning things up. Over 50 vehicles have been removed from the property and the old motel in the back is even getting cleaned up.

Although Tepes would prefer to call it the Fort Davis Rattlesnake Museum, however, that might take a new sign since the mural on the building has become quite beloved.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While in everyday life we do not use it much directly, it is crucial to know the elevation of a place to properly build and construct. For most of the world, this is based on the Amsterdam Ordinance Datum. Before this standard was put in place, each country had its own datum, off of which they could base measurements of elevation, like Sweden's Normalhöjdpunkten.

Switzerland is no different, but because the landlocked country did not have access to the sea, they based their measure on a seemingly random stone in Lake Geneva. The Pierres du Niton (Neptune's Stones) are a pair of glacial erratics, rocks transported by the movement of a glacier. The stones in Geneva harbor were left behind as the Rhône glacier moved across this landscape in the last ice age.

The reference point of the Swiss altimeter system was defined at the Pierres du Niton in the early 19th century. Later measurements, determined by a large web of connected points between Geneva and Marseille, France, put the Pierres du Niton marker's elevation at precisely 373.6 meters above sea level. The stone was picked primarily because of its proximity to the French border and a location that was unlikely to be disturbed by construction or other human activity.]]></summary>

The founder of the Carhartt clothing company lived in Michigan, but had a second home built in Rock Hill because Carhartt owned a large cotton mill in the town. The clothing company employed many of the townspeople in the early 1900s, though this was only one of several major mills that supported the town’s economy.

After Carhartt died, the property was left vacant for a time. New owners came in and tried to restore the property and its grounds, but the site was eventually deserted. Now all that's left is the crumbling remains of the once-grand mansion.

Today, Carhartt clothing is one of the most popular brands in America, though the company no longer has a presence in Rock Hill. This mansion now sits in ruins along the mountain bike trails of what is now the Riverwalk neighborhood. Numerous ruined structures can be freely explored by anyone willing to hike or bike to the location.]]></summary>

Founded in 1581 by Bishop Gheorghe Movila and expanded by Prince Ieremia, the monastery boasts a fortress-like appearance with high walls and defensive towers. According to a local legend, the stone used to build the monastery was transported in an ox-drawn cart by a single woman who was attempting to repent for her sins.

The frescoes, painted by local artists in 1602-1604, are a sight to behold, with the Ladder to Paradise and the Tree of Jesse being the most impressive. The thick walls of the monastery now house a museum with an outstanding collection of historical and art objects, including the tomb covers of Ieremia and Simion Movila, ecclesiastical silverware, books, and illuminated manuscripts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This limestone cave in central Texas was carved by a river that has long since dried up. Now known as Longhorn Cavern (because the wide mouth in its ceiling caused several unsuspecting longhorns to fall to their deaths), the subterranean site has been used by humans for thousands of years.

There is evidence that parts of the cave were used to mine materials for arrowheads and other weapons and tools. During the Civil War, Texans mined the caverns for guano (bat poop), which could be used as an ingredient in gunpowder recipes. Legend has it that failed train robber and outlaw Sam Bass, who wreaked havoc on the nearby city of Round Rock in the 1870s, hid his stash of stolen cash in the caves, though it has never been found. 

In the 1920s, the massive main room of the cavern served as a dance hall called the Underground Ballroom. In the 1960s, Longhorn Cavern became a licensed and stocked nuclear fallout shelter, capable of holding over 1,000 people and stocked with food, water, and other supplies.

 

Inside the cave, you can find a number of distinct formations. There's the Queen's Throne, which resembles an immense, high-backed chair. Standing nearby is a white stone formation that resembles a hound standing at attention. The formation was not carved but discovered by Civilian Conservation Corps workers in another part of the cave. It was moved to be near the throne, and given the nickname the Queen's Watchdog.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Juab County, Utah, there is a natural cave that rivals man-made architectural wonders. This limestone and feldspar cavern was once filled by Lake Bonneville. Since 1956, the Bates family has curated the attraction for the Federal government and offers guided tours from their nearby ranch.

The story goes that the father of the family was out looking for his sheep in the hills and chanced upon a narrow opening in the rock. He uncovered a massive cavern that has, for years, sparked archaeological and geological debates as experts continue to study the cave. From prehistoric creatures to geological mysteries, visitors leave with a story that's millennia in the making.

Minerals found in the cave range from common to rare. One mineral found in the cave, calcite iceland spar—also called "optical calcite"—is revered for its crystal clarity. Historically, it was used for various optical instruments, including the top secret Norden Bombsight of World War II.

You can get an authentic ranch-lodging experience in the Bates' custom cabins, which offer a respite from the Utah sun in a shaded grove of crabapples and grand trees. This land has been in their family since pioneers settled the land. 

Several miles from the ranch cabins is Gandy Warm Springs, which is publicly accessible via a gravel road. Clean, clear, and constantly 81 degrees, this oasis is the perfect place for a swim on a hot day or a soak in the cool evening twilight. Reeds and brush make the spring semi-private from the otherwise wide-open valley.]]></summary>

American author Washington Irving wrote an essay about it: “Woe to the unlucky vessel that ventures into its clutches.”

But many a vessel did venture into those clutches over the centuries. Traversing it could save sailors navigating between New York Harbor and Southern New England days of travel around Long Island.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of four "reaction ferries" that cross the Rhine in Basel, the Münster Ferry carries passengers between Grossbasel to Kleinbasel, relying on the current to do so. The ferries were once common along the Rhine between the 1600s and 1800s, before being gradually replaced by bridges. Now, the Basel ferries are the only ones that remain in operation on this river.

The ferry is attached to a cable that joins the two riverbanks, and moves as the river current pushes against a rudder. The rudder is attached to a long bar, which the boat's driver swings to one side or the other depending on the direction of travel. The faster the current, the faster the trip--leaving your journey entirely up to the whims of the Rhine.

So, sit back and enjoy the relative silence of motorless boat travel and take in one of the most unique views in the city of Münster Cathedral.]]></summary>

As we all know, conservation laws are related to symmetries; each symmetry of the laws of physics creates a conservation law. Or does it? Well, it's a theorem! But it's a theorem when the laws of physics are lagrangian (or hamiltonian). That is, every symmetry of a hamiltonian system is associated with a conservation law in that system. So I asked: How do we know if or whether the world is lagrangian or hamiltonian? How could we know that? My best guess is that we know it because of these very conservation laws! The situation is complex.]]></summary>

Then you observe that the support of a sheaf can be characterized in terms of the supports of its sections, but this doesn't really make sense for sheaves of sets, because the notion of support of a section doesn't really extend to sheaves of sets.  This characterization works for sheaves of abelian groups, but it's not until the next paragraph that you actually explain how to generalize the definition of support of a sheaf in terms of the initial object of the corresponding category.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost unchanged since its completion in 1930, Kokudō Station is popular among enthusiasts of urban exploring areas outside of Tokyo, Japan, even though it remains in operation.

Named after the Keihin Kokudō (today National Route 15), the station is served by Tsurumi Line and used by some 1,500 passengers daily. Getting off here, you'll find that the platforms are nothing unusual, but descend the steps into the dark, lonely concourse and walk into a world stuck in a different time.

The arched corridor was once home to a lantern-lit shopping street, full of izakaya life, but the last of the underpass bars closed down in 2022. Today, the remains of the shops and eateries sit empty or have been boarded up. Some ghost signs have been left behind on the much-graffitied walls. The arcade has become a dusty ruin in a perpetual state of photogenic near-abandonment.

At this murky tunnel's halfway, the underground corridor opens up into a narrow alleyway leading to the residential street outside. Only a few steps long, it's a jumbled-up confusion of veneer boards, corrugated plates, and bricks, plagued by a heavy layer of rust and vandalism here and there.

Outside, up on the right-hand side of the western façade, you can also spot bullet holes left by the strafing gunfire from an Allied attack in 1945, a rare surviving example of World War II-era damage on the periphery of the Tokyo Metropolis.

Unsurprisingly, the station boasts an eclectic filmography spanning decades, used as a location by a number of films and TV dramas. The most notable works are Akira Kurosawa's Stray Dog (1949) and Hirokazu Kore-eda's Maborosi (1995).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bridge Music is the work of composer Joseph Bertolozzi, who recorded sounds of bridge surfaces (including the suspension ropes, railings, girders, and conduit) being hit with various mallets. The resulting 11-track album contains no sounds outside of what was recorded using the Mid-Hudson Bridge itself, a Hudson Valley suspension bridge in Poughkeepsie, New York. (Bertolozzi was actually born in Poughkeepsie.)

The audio installation is experienced from listening stations that house 12 buttons (one for each track of the album and an additional composition called "Suite Poughkeepsie") on the north-facing side of the bridge's two towers.

Originally intended to be a live performance piece, the sound-art installation was completed in 2009 as part of New York's 400th-anniversary observance of Henry Hudson's voyage up the Hudson River.]]></summary>

The “Potato Days” tradition has persevered since 1992, eventually featuring the Little Miss and Mister Tater Tot Pageant, potato decorating, and most famously, instant mashed potato wrestling.

On a hot August day in 2019, photographer Sol Neelman stood on the sidelines—still somehow drenched in instant potatoes—grinning wildly. He remembers being particularly impressed by the high school spud wrestlers. “Generally you don't get that level of experience and athleticism in a mashed potato ring,” he says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bent low beneath a canopy of leathery green leaves in the sweltering heat of a Calabrian summer, Michele Cirelli is searching for a perfect fruit.

Weaving his wrist through the inch-long thorns of his citrus trees, he picks out a good one—deep green and waxy. He takes it, gently, by its plump middle, careful not to damage its precious stem, and turns it slightly, so I might see how the light bounces off the knobbly ridges at its top. “This, this is the type the rabbis want,” he explains. A single one of these fruits, carefully harvested, can fetch more than $300 by the time it arrives in a shop in New York or Montreal. Yet the fruit may never be eaten at all.

This is the cedro Diamante, an ancient citrus better known to many as the citron or etrog—a fruit packed with symbolic and histo…]]></summary>

In her book, Holy Food: How Cults, Communes, and Religious Movements Influenced What We Eat — An American History, Christina Ward traces the way different belief systems have shaped our dietary preferences—whether we realize it or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Japanese, the word mahō means “magic” and typically refers to the Western concept of wizardry and witchcraft, as opposed to such words as majinai or jujutsu which are reserved for the more traditional, divination-or curse-based sorcery.

So while the unusual name of Mahō Jinja in the city of Sōja translates to “magical shrine,” it is not actually a sanctum of sorcerers—though an atypical place of worship nonetheless.

On a hilltop deep in the forest of Okayama Prefecture, a historic province known for its demon legends that inspired Japan’s most famous folk tale, the shrine sits all but forgotten, without even the torii arch or lion-dog statues found in most shrines.

Mahō Shrine is dedicated to Mahō-sama, a local form of the legendary raccoon dog Kyūmō-danuki. Stowing away on a ship carrying Christian missionaries from the West, this demigod of ambiguous origin arrived in Japan in the late 16th century and settled down in the town not long after.

Though the raccoon dog stole food from local shops to live off, he did not cause much trouble otherwise and promised the townsfolk he would protect their cattle and horses and forewarn them of fires and burglaries. In return, the townsfolk built the shrine to honor him.

But how did he earn the epithet of “magic”? According to the historical texts in the local archives, this Mahō is a corruption of the name of a Buddhist goddess, Marici, with the hō “law, dharma” suffixed to it, unrelated to any magic.]]></summary>

When he approached, he realized the log was part of a boat, one that was possibly centuries old.

The man called wardens at the Khortytsia National Reserve, the large national park on the island. Soon the police arrived to cordon off the area, followed by engineers and archaeologists who started an operation to rescue the precious find.

Less than a month earlier, an explosion had destroyed the Russian-controlled Kakhovka Dam, 125 miles downriver from Khortytsia. The waters rushed downstream, swelling the Dnipro River and eventually flooding a huge portion of the region. Dozens of villages were…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kappabashi Kitchen Town is a popular destination just off the historic district of Asakusa, another popular neighborhood in Tokyo.

For over a century, it has been home to many shops specializing in kitchen supplies, growing bigger in the post-war era. Today, there are over 170 such shops in the area, dealing in every kind of kitchenware from traditional dishes to chef uniforms, and vending machines to the world-famous food samples of Japan.

Established in 1907, Niimi is one of the oldest companies based in Kappabashi, and its five-story building is considered an icon of the entire Kitchen Town, topped with a gigantic statue of a mustached chef officially named the "Jumbo Cook."

The Jumbo Cook was installed in March 1982 when Niimi renovated its building, and stands  36 feet tall (11 meters). The company's unforgettable face has since spawned numerous urban legends, and according to the most popular (and ridiculous) rumor, it is actually a giant robot in disguise, the rest of its body hidden in the building, and will be activated when Tokyo faces a Godzilla-class danger.

Some also believe that the colossal chef keeps a pigeon in each of his eyes. Zoom in to his face and you can see why: the irises are concave, and, inside them, white objects represent the light reflected in his eyes—and their shapes do resemble pigeons when seen from afar.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is hard to say when the Sorginetxe was first discovered, but the dolmen in northern Spain has been known for a long time. It is a relatively simple stone structure, a polygonal chamber made up of six interlinked slabs with a seventh that forms a ceiling. It currently has no passageway or covering barrow, though this does not mean that it has always been that way.

The name Sorginetxe means "witch's house" in Basque, and is derived from a folk legend according to which it was built by witches who brought the stones down from the Sierra de Entzia Mountains by night on the distaffs of their spinning wheels. Other legends say that the witches lived at Fuente de Lezao in Eguileor, by the cave of the same name, and that they came to the dolmen to comb their hair.

The oldest known description of the structure dates back to 1833. Sorginetxe was partially excavated in 1890 by Julián de Apraiz, who found human remains and a barbed and tanged arrowhead. These finds have since disappeared. In 1913 it was purchased by the Provincial Council of Alava to ensure its conservation.]]></summary>

I drank iced, frothy tejate for the first time last summer, at a market in Oaxaca, Mexico. Refreshing and lightly sweet, it reminded me of a chocolate protein shake. Tejate does contain cacao nibs, along with dry corn and pixtle, the seed kernels of the mamey sapote fruit. These are toasted and ground together with the fragrant flowers of a different plant called flor de cacao, then mixed with water to produce the beverage, which has ancient pre-Colombian roots.

Inside each mamey, a single large, dark pit nestles against the creamy orange flesh. When I found mamey at my local grocery store in NYC a few weeks ago, I saved the pits, hoping to make my own teja…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lavender-pit"/>
        <updated>2023-09-25T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before Bisbee, Arizona became a center for the arts it was a mining town, and its history still permeates and scars the landscape. The most visible legacy of Bisbee’s copper mining history is the Lavender Pit, visible from an overlook on the route between Bisbee and Historic Lowell.

The name of the pit may conjure up a beautiful sunset and shades of sandstone, but the pit is actually named for mining bigwig Harrison M. Lavender. Lavender was an engineer who rose through the ranks of the Calumet & Arizona Mining Co., which was acquired by the Phelps Dodge Corp., the company that owned Bisbee’s Copper Queen mines. Lavender believed that open-pit mining was the answer to getting more copper ore from Bisbee’s low-grade rock, replacing the existing Sacramento Hill mine. The pit mine opened in 1950. Sadly, Lavender was already dying at this point. He passed away in 1952, and the pit mine was named in his honor.

The pit remained in operation through 1974.It produced more than 600,000 tons of copper, and its expansion led to the demolition of Lowell’s residential district, turning its commercial area into an eerie ghost town. Most notably, it was the home of “Bisbee blue,” a form of uniquely high-quality turquoise. In 1972, Bob Matthews was given a lease to mine turquoise and mined nearly 2,000 pounds by 1974. By then, world copper prices had crashed, and Bisbee’s low-quality copper was an early casualty. Phelps Dodge left, the mines were scuttled and closed, and Bisbee was left for dead before reinventing itself years later.

Today, the Lavender Pit is a popular tourist attraction for those headed to the border. Its turquoise remains rare, and is found in high-end galleries and mimicked in stores throughout town. Visitors to the overlook will be able to observe the pit and read interpretive signage explaining the history of the pit, and the meaning of the red, gray, yellow, and yes, lavender layers of rock that are now forever exposed to nature.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally a bookbinder from Chicago, Emil Meininger moved to Colorado after losing everything in the Great Chicago Fire. He opened the first art supply store in Denver, H. R. Meininger Co., in 1881. Meininger sold art supplies to and befriended Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell.

With the expansion of the Fine Arts Department by later generation Meininger's, by 1986, the store had become the largest art supply store west of the Mississippi. In its current location since 1993, H. R. Meininger Co. has had everyone visit from Dwight D. Eisenhower to Daniel Sprick. 

Still family-owned and operated to this day, guests can visit the 7,000-square-foot store in Denver, which not only sells art supplies and inspiration but is also filled with artwork, history, and cases full of antique and unique art supplies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Along Route 299 in the township of Kanna stands a wall of mountain cliff known as the Sazanami-iwa (“ripple rock”). Discovered in 1953 during the construction of a road, it was initially believed to be just that—a rock with ancient ripple marks; but it later turned out to be something much more.

Often referred to as the “ripple marks of Sebayashi” after the former village it is located in, the rock was thoroughly researched by Gunma University upon its discovery. When its team of academics made a report, it mentioned “strange holes” alongside the ripple marks.

Later, in 1960, the “holes” were identified as dinosaur footprints, the first fossil track to be found in Japan. As it turned out, there were over 50 of them here. The new report attracted curious tourists to the site despite its remote location, receiving 30,000 visitors that year.

Following this, Kanna started to brand itself as a “dinosaur kingdom,” opening a museum called the Kanna Dinosaur Center in 1987, exhibiting local fossils and Mongolian dinosaurs. Notably, it’s also home to specimens of the Sanchūryū, a previously unknown and understudied species of Gallimimus.

Though the museum’s collection is rather impressive, the “dinosaur kingdom” of Kanna remains an obscure destination due to its difficult accessibility. From the nearest bus stop, it takes about an hour by foot to get to the Sebayashi ripple marks.]]></summary>

It’s going to be a swanky affair with high-profile guests, and you’re determined to make a good impression. You’ve figured out your outfit and you’ve packed your spoon and napkin (Roman hosts did not provide these). There’s just one part of the evening that concerns you: conversation.

The other guests will be well-traveled and well-read, especially in the Greek literature popular with Roman elites. What if you don’t get their references? What if you can’t think of anything clever to say, and you never get invited to another dinner? After a moment’s panic, you breathe a sigh of relief and head for your library. Your social success is assured; you’ve just remembered that you own a copy of Deipnosophistae.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Step into the annals of history and explore the captivating journey of Chimopar, the venerable cornerstone of Romanian chemical ingenuity. Created in 1895 under the visionary leadership of General Eremia Grigorescu, Chimopar, also known as Dudești Chemical Enterprise, rises as a time-honored emblem of innovation. Its legacy, steeped in the alchemy of creation and destruction, harkens back to an era when it stood tall as a vital producer of gunpowder and specialized compounds. It is currently a large, abandoned complex of several buildings that eventually became bankrupt, turning into a ruin in outer Bucharest.

The story is not without its tumultuous twists. Echoes of earthquakes and the resounding echoes of explosions, in 1904 and 1923 respectively, bear witness to the trials borne by this industrious bastion. Undeterred, it pressed forward, even as the Communist Regime cast its transformative shadow. The very fabric of Chimopar expanded under its influence, but the winds of change blew fiercely, ushering in the seismic shifts of 1989. As Romania's industrial landscape crumbled, Chimopar too fell victim to privatization in the 90s. It has since been left abandoned, explored by many who wish to see its old factory walls.

Today, the factory's grounds offer a remarkable blend of contrasts, a canvas upon which history, art, and adventure converge. Once a hub of industrial fervor, it now beckons street artists and airsoft teams, calling upon hipsters and sports enthusiasts alike to use its space. In the symphony of decay and revival, a chorus of graffiti writers has given colour to the walls. With vibrant strokes, they have etched tales upon the slabs, each stroke an ode to the past's rewritten heartbeat. A magnetic allure draws many inquisitive adventurers captivated by the forgotten stories of Chimopar. The factory is worth a visit if you would like to understand both the history of the country and see something unique.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Located just three miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, Frontera Sculpture Oasis is a unique celebration of the Earth as envisioned by a singular artist working in the borderland near Columbus, New Mexico.

This fascinating sculpture garden is the work of Taras Mychalewych, a German emigre raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. After wandering through New Mexico for four days after his car blew up in the midst of a cross-country drive, he decided to move there and build a sculpture garden. He describes the park as infused with feminine energy, derived from the Mother of God (or Prajñāpāramitā), and Mother Earth. The message appears to be a tribute and appreciation to nature, and perhaps a warning to those who have defiled it in the name of profit.

The garden is nestled in the Chihuahuan desert, where agave and cholla mingle with the work. The oasis is explicitly inspired by the Watts Towers, and perhaps includes elements of other roadside outsider sculpture parks. Sculptural figures appear to be built out of scavenged or donated media, ranging from bricks to bottles. A makeshift biosphere mingles with sculptures crafted to mimic the shapes of the surrounding natural environment. A colorful display includes figures representing a regional mariachi band, welcoming people to the borderlands.]]></summary>

It was 2014, and Daniel Franklin, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Western Australia, was on Beacon Island, a tiny patch of land off Australia’s west coast. The remains he was looking for belonged to a traveler who, in 1628, boarded the Batavia, one of the most ill-fated ships in history.

Franklin was pretty sure the skeleton was here because, in the 1960s, archaeologists had found a skull covered in heavy fractures in the same place. At the time, the rest of the individual—everything from the neck down—was trapped under the concrete floor of a fisherman’s hut. But …]]></summary>

In this episode of The Atlas Obscura Podcast, we visit a community in rural central Virginia that has been testing an interesting premise for decades—that maybe three, or four, or more parental figures are even better than two. This episode is part of a collaboration we did with Freakonomics. You can find a larger episode on this topic here.

Our podcast is an audio guide to the world’s wondrous, awe-inspiring, strange places. In under 15 minutes, we’ll take you to an incredible site, and along the way you’ll meet some fascinating people and hear their stories. Join us daily, Monday through Thursday, to explore a new wonder with cofounder Dylan Thuras and a neighborhood of Atlas Obscura reporters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the end of last week I had a great conversation with Valentina Tardugno (NYU) and Phil Armitage (Flatiron) about how planets form. I spent the whole weekend thinking about it: If a few planets are forming in a proto-planetary disk, there are all sorts of interactions between the planets and the disk, and the planets and each other, and the disk with itself. You can think of this (at least) two different ways:
You can think of planets which are interacting not just directly with one another, but also with a disk, and with each other as mediated by that disk. This is the planet-centric view. In this view, the planets are what you are tracking, and the disk is a latent object that makes the planets interact and evolve.
Alternatively, you can think of the disk, with planets in it. In this disk-centric view, the planets are latent objects that modify the disk, creating gaps and spiral waves.
Both views are legitimate, and both have interesting science questions. We will explore and see where to work. I am partial to the planet-centric view: I want to know where planetary systems come from!]]></summary>

I like design language: How do you design your whole research program, and how do you design individual projects so they fit into it. One interaction was in the Astronomical Data Meeting at Flatiron, where Vivi Acquaviva (CUNY) talked about the intersection between what you are good at, what is important, and what brings you joy. That's a hard intersection to find. Or way too easy; I am not sure. The other interaction was a conversation with Jiayin Dong (Flatiron), who is thinking about faculty job applications and the like. How to talk about your research in terms of the next decade instead of the next year?
One comment that is frequently made by Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA) is that he feels like most early-career (and even mid-career) people spend too much time  their science and not enough time  their science. It is important to be able to answer “why” questions about your research, and in the medium term it helps all your projects.doingplanning and justifying]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you’re a kid, sometimes it feels like your home is the center of the universe. Well, in Chanute, Kansas, one Google software engineer named Dan Webb had the wherewithal to actually make that happen, and in turn, the town recognized his achievement through one of America’s oddest murals.

The story actually begins with the work of a different engineer, Brian McClendon, who was a co-founder of the company that eventually became the basis of Google Earth. McClendon was a Jayhawk through and through, and set the default location of Google Earth on PCs to center on his childhood home in Lawrence, Kansas, due to its relative proximity to the geographic center of the continental United States. Not to be outdone, Webb, a fellow Kansan who headed the Mac team, directed Google Earth to center instead on his hometown of Chanute.

Ordinarily that’s where this anecdote would end, as it did in Lawrence, with an article in the paper and a cute Easter egg for aficionados. But Chanute took this claim to fame fiercely to heart, and created what may be the world’s most permanent screenshot. In 2010, the Chanute Area Chamber of Commerce commissioned a mural of the Google Earth display on Mac computers, and installed it in the center of the town’s busiest intersection. The map includes an outline of the United States of America, a giant star with Chanute, Kansas highlighted in the center, and a copyright verifying the screenshot.

Of course, Google Earth has long since stopped defaulting to any single central location, and would not likely choose such an Amero-centric center point even if it did. However, the mural is still on display today, and banners displayed elsewhere in town make clear that Chanute is the center of Google Earth (on Mac computers). You can visit the mural when you’re in town, and if you’re not able to make it? Don’t worry. The mural is still visible on Google Earth.]]></summary>

“Osmia cobaltina,” Best says, plucking an amethyst-colored mason bee from the box. “It’s crazy, right? How can a bee be purple?”

Native bees, such as this one, are responsible for pollinating three-quarters of all flowering plants. Tens of thousands of these intrepid indigenous pollinators can be found in almost every corner of the world, including Alaska and even the Arctic.

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yamanoue-inscription-and-tumulus-japan"/>
        <updated>2023-09-22T18:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are only 18 examples of ancient stelae surviving from Japan’s classical antiquity, which roughly corresponds to the Early Middle Ages of the West. Located in the city of Takasaki, the Three Stelae of Kōzuke are the oldest of Japan’s stone inscriptions.

The Yamanoue Stele, the oldest of the three, has stood on a lonely hill since 681, from the Asuka period. It bears the oldest known example of an inscription written in Chinese characters and Japanese grammar. The andesite boulder is hardly worked, similar to the stelae of the Silla kingdom of Korea, and the calligraphic style seems to be a variation of the clerical script.

The inscription is as follows: “I inscribe this on the third day of the tenth moon, in the Year of the Snake and Pig. Kurome-no-toji, granddaughter of Takemori-no-mikoto, who governed the Sano-Miyake domain; this is a dedication from Chōri-no-hōshi to his mother, who bore him after marrying Ōgo-no-omi, son of Niikawa-no-omi son of Tatami-no-sukune. A monk of Hōkō-ji.”

Simply put, the stele was erected by the monk Chōri-no-hōshi in memorial of his late mother, Kurome-no-toji, perhaps after burying her in the adjacent tomb.

Now known as the Yamanoue tumulus, this well-preserved burial mound was originally built in the mid-6th century to entomb some local prince. It was, however, not an uncommon practice to drag the buried lords out of their resting places to make room for another person; it has been theorized that that’s what happened with the burial of Kurome-no-toji.

The tumulus is also a rare example of kofun, the ancient Japanese burial mound, as it is clear who is entombed and when it took place; most other sites do not provide such information. Together, the stele and the tumulus make for a fascinating trip of archaeological interest in an otherwise sleepy countryside.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Memorial for Victims of the German Occupation stands at the southern end of Liberty Square. Built in 2014, it was meant to commemorate the Nazi takeover of Hungary that occurred on March 19, 1944. The memorial shows the archangel Gabriel, representing Hungary, being attacked by a Germanic eagle with the year 1944 on its ankle, set against a backdrop of broken columns. An inscription at the base of the monument reads, "In memory of the victims."

Jewish groups have criticized the memorial as an attempt by Hungary's government to absolve themselves of responsibility for their complicity with the Holocaust. Some have said the monument sends a message that the Hungarians could do nothing to resist Nazi Germany and therefore are not to blame for the atrocities that occurred within Hungary. 

Others criticized what they saw as an attempt to absolve the Horthy regime of blame for the terrors of WWII and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Hungarians.  At the time of the memorial's construction, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was accused of "falsifying the Holocaust" and "confusing the murderer and the victim." 

It was considered so controversial from the announcement of its development to mark the 70th anniversary of the occupation that its installation was completed in the middle of the night.

In Hungary, the Holocaust began years before the arrival of German soldiers, with pogroms, mass killings, deportations, and forced labor camps. Germany then got help from the Hungarian authorities in deporting 437,000 Jews in 1944.

In front of the memorial, you will find photos and messages left by the families of those killed during this dark period of Hungarian history, making the memorial even more poignant.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once a year—typically in the early summer, then occasionally again at the start of the fall—Welsh sheep farmers enlist the help of shearers and farmhands to help them for a special occasion: Shearing Day. In the midst of an arduous day of shearing sheep, the workers are rewarded with cups of tea, a spread of food, and cake.

Shearing cake, or cacen gneifo (pronounced "c-ack-en guh-nigh-fo") in Welsh, was traditionally made to celebrate Shearing Day. A simple, buttery sponge, the cake was studded with heady caraway seed, lemon rind, and candied citrus peel, and finished with a dusting of confectioners’ sugar. While some older generations have nostalgic memories of baking it with family members, today many struggle to recollect shearing cake.

The lake, home to plenty of ducks, geese, and swans, is also home to three islands in the middle of it.

The quiet atmosphere of this small and tranquil nature reserve is not where you might expect to find an ongoing territorial dispute. In 2005, inspired by the stories of other micronations, local school teacher Louis Stephens started to look into his own micronation experiment. A local area, formerly known as Baffins Farm, which included a reasonably sized pond, was sold to the Portsmouth Council in 1938. However, the pond on this land was not specifically mentioned within the land sale (despite centuries of official docu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1920s, Tulsa, Oklahoma, booming with oil money, built a thriving central downtown of glimmering gold-hued Art Deco buildings unlike those seen anywhere in the American West. However, one of the most striking buildings of this era was not a skyscraper at all, but rather a gas station designed to resemble the Hagia Sophia. A century later, this structure remains the center of Tulsa’s arts and nightlife scene, and the symbol of this offbeat and hardscrabble prairie city’s cultural revival.

The Blue Dome began its life as the White Star Service Station, designed by local architects Lawrence Blue and Fred L. Knoblock. The gas station was opened in January 1925 by Robert Chastain of Chastain Oil Co. At that time, it was Tulsa’s first full-service 24-hour filling station, with a service attendant who lived inside the dome. The next year, Route 66 opened, and the station's distinctive look made it a popular landmark until the route was adjusted in the early 1930s.

In the 1950s, the gas station closed its doors. The Blue Dome became the home of Veterans Bar until 1999, and has also hosted an antique store and other business. Currently, the Blue Dome is in private hands, owned by Jo and Chris Armstrong of the neighboring Arnie’s Bar.

Although it is no longer open to the public, the Blue Dome has lent its distinctive name and visage to the entire neighborhood, now known as the Blue Dome Historic District. The dome has hosted art festivals and pop-up shops, and the bars and shops in the area frequently reference its appearance. Street lights, planting pots, and other civic fixtures now bear the color and shape of the iconic dome.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Milwaukee suburb of Menomonee Falls off Highway 45 is Redner's Rescued Cat Figurine Mewseum, a private home collection of over 3,500 cat figurines and other feline memorabilia.

Shawn Redner began collecting cat figurines in 2018, taking home whatever he could find in antique malls, rummage sales, and thrift stores. He acquired cat music boxes, cat cookie jars, cat plates, cat art—even cat-inspired furniture. Eventually, Redner's collection became substantial enough that he and his wife Hilary decided that they wanted to share it with the public, so in 2020 they opened their home one day a month where people could come visit.

After the local news picked up what they were doing, the Redners began receiving massive donations of cat figurines from people all over the country. Each donation is labeled with who and where it's from. Now their collection has about 3,500 cat items on display, with about that amount in storage as well.

Shawn and Hilary Redner are excited to show off the Mewseum to anyone who pays them a visit. Every room, wall, and space contains either cat figurines or something cat-related. They also have nine live cats complete with a custom-built outdoor enclosure to roam around.

The Mewseum takes donations at the door. All proceeds go towards local cat rescues. The Redners' goal is to eventually move everything into a larger space and open a cat cafe with the entire collection displayed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the heart of Paris on 7 rue Méchain, an architectural marvel by Robert Mallet-Stevens emerges, a unique apartment building designed in 1928-1929. Crafted at the request of Jean Deschamps, it remains hidden behind an unassuming street facade, a treasure trove of Mallet-Stevens' signature design elements which include spatial harmonies, innovative angles, and panoramic rooftop terraces. Its windows are exquisite, just like the interior, if you are ever given the chance to enter it.

Within its walls, the Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka found her creative haven. After moving to Paris in 1918, she embodied the Art Deco spirit with daring nudes and empowering portrayals of the modern woman. Her studio duplex apartment, a masterpiece itself, was home to her timeless works like The Sleeping Girl and Young Lady with Gloves. It occupied the second and third floors.

While it is difficult to arrange a visit to the exact space she used as her atelier for 15 years, the building's interior called upon the collaboration of Louis Barrillet for stained glass, Jean Prouvé for metal railings, and the Atelier Jean Perzel for lighting, which makes this unassuming building absolutely stunning if you get the chance to even venture into the hallway.

In short, 7 rue Méchain tells the tale of an architectural symphony intertwined with the vibrant spirit of an artist ahead of her time. The building itself is an example of Art Deco architecture and gives a sense of the dazzling 1930s life. Although unassuming and rather hidden, it's a brilliant sight to understand Paris' role as a major art and culture center in Europe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and its strict isolationist policy, the Meiji era of Japan (1868-1912) saw rapid modernization as it opened its borders to the West. The new government was ready to present itself as a modern nation by the 1880s, hosting grand balls and elaborate banquets for foreign guests.

The center of Japan’s Westernization is said to have been the Rokumeikan, an opulent two-story building completed in 1883. It was commissioned by Marquess Inoue Kaoru, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and designed by British architect Josiah Conder. Meant to be a symbol of modernization, the Rokumeikan soon became known for its French-style parties and banquets, the envy of the commoners.

The reactions to it were not all positive, however. Westerners were unimpressed and disappointed in its mediocre imitation of their culture while the Japanese conservatives considered it a place of outrageous debauchery. The so-called “Rokumeikan diplomacy” also failed to achieve Inoue’s desired goals of revising treaties in Japan’s favor, resulting in his resignation.

The Rokumeikan era only lasted from 1883 to 1887, and its influences are greatly exaggerated. Other state guest houses of the period and their parties are often confused with those held at the Rokumeikan, further mythicizing its legacies. In reality, after all, it was meant for accommodation rather than for parties.

From 1890 to 1927 it was used by the Peers’ Club and then by a military insurance company, before getting demolished in 1940. Nothing much remains today, except for the staircase and wallpaper preserved at the University of Tokyo’s Faculty of Engineering and the chandelier housed at Tōmyō-ji Temple in Hirai, Edogawa Ward.

On the site, the main gate was preserved but was lost in the fires of World War II. Today, there is only an inconspicuous plaque marking the location of the legendary Rokumeikan, unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of the modern city.]]></summary>

For gravity does vary across the earth, meaning Newton’s apple has a slightly different weight in various other parts of the world and falls at slightly different speeds. That’s due to a combination of four factors.

From 1545 to 1552, the missionary was based on and off in the port of Portuguese Malacca (Melaka), where there now stands a 19th-century church named after him as well as a statue commemorating his visit. He died from a fever while on the way to China, and his body was carried back to Malacca for a temporary burial, before being shipped to Goa, India, in 1553.

The statue was erected in 1952 for the 400th anniversary of his last visit to Malacca. It stands in front of the hilltop ruins of St. Paul’s Church, where there is an open grave marking the site of Xavier’s temporary burial.

An interesting feature of this statue is his missing right hand, an attribute absent in most artistic depictions of the saint. This is because he had all of his limbs intact during his life—his right forearm, which he used to bless and baptize his converts, was only amputated after his death. It is said that it still bled when it was cut off.

While his (mostly) incorruptible body rests in permanent peace in Velha Goa, the detached right hand was sent to Rome in 1614 and remains in a silver reliquary at the Il Gesù church, and portions of the relic are also displayed in Macau and Sydney.

Though that’s the story with his right hand, some locals and tour guides of Malacca have a different version to tell. They claim that the statue did once have both hands in fact, but was struck by lightning one day and lost the right hand, perhaps by divine intervention.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the turn of the 20th century, amusement parks known as White Cities were built across the United States. These were also known as trolley parks, since they were located on the trolley line and trolleys were the main form of transportation to and from the parks. One of these parks, Lakeside Amusement Park, was built outside of Denver in 1908.

Through good times and bad, Lakeside Amusement Park still stands and operates as it did over 100 years ago. Its crown jewel, the Tower of Jewels, no longer shines as brightly as it once did or even serves as the main entrance, but children of all ages can still have a fun time at the same park their great-great-grandparents may have enjoyed.

A miniature railway can take you around Lake Rhoda for a scenic tour of Lakeside, Colorado. You may notice some abandoned or refurbished attractions. The entire park has been saved from the dustbin of history through some creative architectural salvage operations that have kept most, but not all of its rides operating.]]></summary>

One is that there was pirate treasure buried there, and an excavation to find it went so deep that they could barely see the sky. Then, as many know from digging too deep right next to a large body of water, the Gulf went pouring in from the side, making the pond that's there today.

There are a couple of urban legends about someone being murdered and tossed into the pond, giving it its name.

There was one about the pond connecting to a spirit who would pull any who got too close under the water, then spit their bodies back up as a warning.

Beyond legends, there are also spotted salamanders around the pond.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neptune's Staircase is composed of eight locks and is located on a stretch of the Caledonian Canal overlooked by an impressive range of mountains, including Ben Nevis. 

A staircase lock is when two or more adjacent locks have the upper gate of one lock also serving as the lower gate of the next lock. Due to this design, once one boat has entered the staircase it has committed to going through all the locks. The structure was built between 1803 and 1822 by Thomas Telford. The project was also designed to provide jobs to residents of the Highlands.

Each of the current lock gates weighs 22 tons. A team of at least three lock-keepers is needed to operate the staircase. The staircase usually operates on an efficient basis.

The system was originally hand-powered but has been converted to hydraulic power. In the past, the locks were operated by capstans, each with four poles that made seven full revolutions to open and close each gate. Each gate was operated by two capstans, one to open and another to close. Transit times through the staircase have been reduced from just over half a day to 90 minutes with the conversion to hydraulic rams and push-button controls.

Visitors can still see the plinths where the original capstans were anchored, but the capstans themselves have been removed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, there are just five sand synagogues remaining in the world. Three of them are located in the Caribbean, on the islands of Curacao, Jamaica, and St. Thomas. One is in Suriname, and one is in the Netherlands, where the concept of a sand synagogue was first born.

The Kingston sand floor synagogue in nestled into a quiet street in the bustling island capital. Visitors are welcome if they contact the synagogue in advance and receive permission. The wooden rows, perfectly groomed sand, and high ceilings are authentic to the island and Sephardic traditions.

The Shaare Shalom Synagogue that stands today was built in 1912, after an earlier building at the site was damaged during the Kingston earthquake of 1907. But Jamaica's Jewish community has deep roots. The Spanish occupation of Jamaica lasted from 1494–1655, and during that time a number of Jewish settlers came to the island. Multiple synagogues were constructed across the island in the 17th century.]]></summary>

The Madrid city council wanted to commemorate this moment by placing a replica of the cabin seen in the film in an area adjacent to the actual filming location. 

La Cabina (The Phone Booth) is a 1972 television movie directed by Spanish director Antonio Mercero. When it first aired on Spanish television it became an instant success. 

It not only went on to win the first-ever Emmy for a Spanish TV film, but it also became a breakthrough for Mercero, who later created other commercial hits with series such as Verano Azul or Farmacia de Guardia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Located on St Mary’s churchyard wall in Ivinghoe is a long, imposing tool known as a thatch hook. This particular instrument was designed for the purpose of extinguishing thatched roof fires. For much of history, prior to the advent of firefighters, communities relied upon their neighbor's help to fight fires. This is where the thatch hook came into play, as it was used to drag the burning thatch from the roof of the cottage to prevent the fire from spreading. The huge hook required several individuals to wield it effectively.

Beneath the thatch hook, there are two additional items on display. The first is a brass plaque commemorating the coronation of Edward VII in 1902, while the second is a "mantrap" used on private property to discourage intruders and poachers, a reminder of the harsh realities of life during the 18th century.

Today, the thatch hook serves as a relic of the past, as there are no longer any thatched roofs in Ivinghoe. Nevertheless, it remains a fascinating artifact that offers a glimpse into the unique challenges faced by communities during a bygone era.]]></summary>

It might sound like the dessert version of Turducken, but this Hungarian-Jewish treat is no fleeting trend created as a social media–friendly novelty.

The roots of flódni go back to medieval France and Germany. The word itself comes from the German fladen, a flat thin cake. According to a researcher at Tel Aviv University, the earliest reference to a Jewish flat cake also called fladen dates back to the 10th century. At that time, it was typically made with cheese. Today’s flódni, however, was developed by the Jews of the Carpathian Basin, who added more layers and fruit fillings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This spooky subterranean grotto ballroom is called the Rathskeller. Located in Louisville's Seelbach Hotel, it's the only surviving room in the world completely encrusted in Rookwood pottery, from stem to stern, and has a powerfully creepy vibe.

The Bavarian-style Rathskeller Room was constructed of Rookwood Pottery in 1907. A unique work of art and the only room of its kind in the world that’s still intact, this room is an ornate, preserved part of American history. The decorations of the room were drawn by hand on the clay before firing; the design was a part of the ware. After baking, various glazes were added in subsequent firings. A portion of the ceiling is made of leather and was painted with intricate designs (including the 12 signs of the zodiac).

Al Capone is said to have used secret tunnels in and out of the place as part of his organized crime operation. When F. Scott Fitzgerald was a young soldier stationed at Camp Zachary Taylor, he came into Louisville and was a frequent visitor at the Seelbach Hotel's subterranean bar. The time Fitzgerald spent there allegedly inspired parts of The Great Gatsby.

The hotel is also chock-full of ghost stories. Its most infamous ghost is known as the "Lady in Blue," said to be the spirit of a young woman who died in one of the hotel's elevator shafts.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The stable political and economic environment of Switzerland has made it an attractive location for scientists for hundreds of years. A section of this history is showcased in Geneva's Musée d'Histoire des Sciences (Museum of History of Science), where the developments made between the 17th and 19th centuries are showcased alongside additional more modern tools. 

In the past, science was largely an occupation for the elite, meaning that those who practiced it were either rich enough to afford it or had patrons who could pay them to pursue it. This means that everything up to their equipment was often very well made, also in a way that made the instruments pleasing to the eye besides just functional. This makes them the ideal tool to explain science with, as important parts were often laid bare for show rather than covered to be protected.

Many of those instruments are on display in the museum, tools that were used in the fields of astronomy, microscopy, gnomonics, electricity, meteorology, and measuring in general.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long ago, if you ordered Neapolitan pizza at an Italian restaurant, you might have ended up with a slice of custard pie.

The modern definition for pizza did not appear in an Italian dictionary until 1905. The Italian word pizza, which is likely related to Greek pita and Turkish pide, was originally a general term for flat baked dishes made with flour. You can still see this term in action today in dishes like pizza rustica, a rich egg-and-cheese-stuffed pie from central Italy, or pizza Ebraica, a blackened cookie made with nuts and dried fruit that originated in the Jewish quarter of Rome.

Before the 20th century, the cheese pizza that we know and love was a local street food little-known outside of Naples. Some 19th-century writers who encountered cheese pizza even described it wi…]]></summary>

Daly and colleagues catch the famously ferocious fish off the coast of southern Mozambique and fit them with transmitters as part of a long-distance tracking project to reveal more about the animals’ habits. The team uses strong lines and circle hooks—harmless to the sharks—baited with striped bonito fish, thick rubber mats to protect the inflatable boat from sharp teeth, and something called tonic immobility: essentially, a shark’s Achilles’ heel.

“Once you can get a shark upside down, they pretty much just fall asleep,” says Daly. “It's pretty incredible.”

Its redevelopment demanded the establishment of a red-light district catering to the locals and foreigners alike, meant to be a place for international social exchange.

Legend has it that the Ganki-rō ("stone turtle tower"), Yokohama's most opulent brothel, was home to a beautiful young courtesan named Kiyuu. Brought in from the infamous Yoshiwara pleasure district of Edo (Tokyo), it is said that she refused the company of a foreigner out of pride, writing a death poem before slitting her throat: Tsuyu wo dani / itou yamato no / ominaeshi / furu amerika ni / sode wa nurasaji.

        <updated>2023-09-20T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the town of Prrenjas, situated in eastern Albania, a once-dilapidated industrial relic has been transformed into a captivating landmark. Artist Eljan Tanini took a pair of abandoned nickel mining towers—vestiges of Albania's failed industrial aspirations under communist rule—and transformed them with an astonishing 1,380 ladybugs. Symbolizing femininity and good fortune, these ladybugs are a vibrant nod to the town's female mayor and its broader identity.

During the rule of communist leader Enver Hoxha, Albania underwent a period of intense industrialization while being cut off from the rest of the world. This left a legacy of aging factories, bunkers, and mining facilities scattered across the country. Since the fall of communism, these structures have largely been abandoned, standing as solemn monuments to a repressive past. However, art projects like the one in Përrenjas demonstrate the potential for turning these sites into symbols of renewal and hope.

The project was completed in just 22 days and features eco-friendly paint. The mining towers themselves go more than 300 meters underground. Additionally, a tree has sprouted 52 meters up on one of the towers, offering a striking symbol of nature's resilience.

As you traverse the intriguing landscape of Albania, a stop in Prrenjas offers a unique chance to witness this extraordinary confluence of industrial decay and contemporary artistic vision. Through initiatives like this, artists are helping to redefine Albania's historical scars as canvases for cultural expression, showing that even in the most unlikely places, there's room for beauty and change.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The volunteer-driven cultural association Bolsjefabrikken (The Candy Factory) has taken its name from an abandoned candy factory, the group’s very first location, and is behind Copenhagen’s (and possibly Denmark’s) largest street art hotspot. Artists and activists have been infusing new vitality into the current Bolsjefabrikken place since 2009. Once a smithy, the locale’s exterior walls now serve as ever-transforming canvases for street artists, resulting in a captivating display of colors, shapes, and messages.

Bolsjefabrikken has gained official recognition as a designated area for artistic expression, thanks to the endorsement of local authorities. This acknowledgment not only validates the art created on these walls but also nurtures a profound sense of belonging among the individuals who have rejuvenated its premises. Alongside its varied non-profit offerings, the venue hosts music performances, film screenings, and communal gatherings.

Whether you’re a culture enthusiast or someone seeking an immersive urban adventure, Bolsjefabrikken offers an ever-shifting and thought-provoking experience. In this mural mecca, contemporary graffiti shines as brilliantly and boldly as the vibrant candies that were once manufactured in the factory that named the collective years ago.]]></summary>

The cabin on the premises belonged to Rev. Samuel and Florella Adair, Oberlin College graduates who moved westward with the promise of a new free state. Florella was John Brown’s half-sister, and five of his sons, and eventually John Brown himself moved to the cabin. By this time, Brown believed that he was charged by God to fight the moral scourge of slavery. The cabin became an organizing force for the abolition movement in Kansas, and a stop on the Underground Railroad, and the Adairs began to fear …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Halte Royal d'Ardennes (the Royal Train Stop of the Ardennes) was a private train stop built for King Leopold II of Belgium and linked to the royal family's summer residence, Château royal d'Ardenne. Court architect Alphonse Balat designed the opulent residence, which was completed in 1891. Guests and royalty would use the private train stop to visit the château, which also featured extensive gardens designed by the Paris-based landscape architect Elie Lainé.

Within a few years, Leopold II decided to repurpose the residence into a luxury hotel. Wealthy guests from Belgian, French, and English began to visit the hotel via the train. The hotel featured every luxury amenity of the time: running water, bathrooms, electrical lights, and even a telephone. 

Both the train station and the hotel were shuttered during World War I after sustaining some damage. 

The hotel and train stop briefly reopened after being restored and expanded after the war. But then, during World War II, both suffered further damage. Finally, in 1968, the hotel burned down and the train stop was abandoned. (It's not the only abandoned royal Belgian train station, either.)

Despite this, the train stop is still an impressive ruin with its watch tower and stone walls. Surrounded by the River Lesse on one side and the woods and hills of the Belgian Ardennes on the other, the dilapidated station looks more like something out of a fairytale.

A special architectural feature is the cobblestone driveway, spiraling out from the platform and around a central courtyard. You don't need much imagination to see the coaches lined up, waiting to pick up the VIPs of their time.]]></summary>

At the heart of this chasm flows an underground river of 55 kilometers. The first documented exploration of this cave was in 1889 by the French spelunker Edouard-Alfred Martel, the founder of modern speleology.

This unique place is also associated with a legend about its formation. It is said that Satan himself dug the chasm to challenge Saint Peter, who, by jumping over it with his mount, saved the souls of the damned that Satan was supposed to take to hell.

In 1907, a small dry stone wall was discovered, along with the remains of a hearth on the floor covered with ashes, charcoal, kitchen debris, and even weapons. Armand Viré, another sp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Best known as the "Father of the Erie Canal," DeWitt Clinton was a great man who has a great man's grave. That wasn't always the case—the grave that is; Clinton made the most of his well-established colonial family and education at leading 18th-century colleges.

Clinton served in the New York State Assembly and Senate and as a result of a vacancy, was briefly a United States senator. He served 10 one-year terms as the appointed (as was the case then) mayor of New York City. While Clinton was mayor, he also held office as lieutenant governor and narrowly lost the race for president of the United States to James Madison. He served four nonconsecutive terms as governor and died in office in 1828, shortly before his 59th birthday. 

In addition, Clinton was a director of the Bank for Saving…]]></summary>

I knew I had made a mistake almost instantly. It was Christmas, and my mother and I were preparing jiu hoo char, a stir-fried dish of finely shredded jicama, cabbage, dried cuttlefish, and a host of other ingredients. Because everything must be uniformly diced into even-sized pieces, the preparation can take a few hours—which is why I impatiently asked, “Do we have to cut them this way?”

Cue a stern glare and a cultural lesson.

Jiu hoo char is a specialty of the Peranakans, a cultural group that stretches across Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia. While not Peranakan herself, my mother inherited her jiu hoo char recipe from my grandmother, who inherited it…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soutra Aisle was a medieval hospital, a place of refuge for wayfarers and pilgrims, one that welcomed the needy or elderly as well as the sick and infirm. It also acted as a place of sanctuary for fugitives. It stands midway between Edinburgh and the rich Borders abbeys on the Via Regia or Royal Highway, the main Anglo-Scottish road for the medieval period. This spot was originally the place where five roads met, which ensured a regular flow of people in need.

Soutra Aisle was first mentioned in 1164 after King Malcolm IV confirmed the foundation of the charter. The hospital was run by the Augustinian Order, funded by the income from the large hospital estate. Despite being located in a war zone up until 1320, Soutra Aisle continued to grow. It eventually covered an area of 700 square meters, and became one of the three most important hospitals in Scotland at the time.

Soutra Aisle was of both national and international importance up until the 1460s, when it experienced a rapid decline. Soutra Aisle lost its lands, which caused an almost instant loss of funds that was devastating to the hospital. The estate was confiscated and handed to the Trinity College Hospital in Edinburgh because the Master of the Hospital, Stephen Fleming was accused of misconduct.

It only survived because it became the burial vault of the Pringle family. This new purpose saved the church from the same fate as the rest of the site, which saw its stone carted away and repurposed in nearby building projects.

Archaeological excavations have turned up rare seeds, sourced from all over the world, that were used for their medicinal properties, including opium poppies, cloves, and hemlock.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1885, an act of Parliament made the Manchester Ship Canal possible. Within the act, there were around 300 pages of technical requirements included to satisfy landowners along the 36-mile route.

One of those requirements was for a "ferry by night and by day whenever required" to be maintained by the canal's owners to replace Hulmes Bridge, a low-lying bridge that connected the villages of Flixton and Irlam.

Originally serviced by rear-oared scull boats, the free Hulmes Ferry is still in operation today with the Peel Group now responsible for its maintenance. The boat is harbored on the Flixton side of the river, so those crossing from the Irlam side need to ring a bell to get the ferryman's attention.

The crossing takes just under a minute to complete, with a limit of four passengers onboard.

Similar rights of way across the canal can be found upriver, with the Thelwall Ferry providing a similar service for the small cost of 11p, and the Warburton Toll Bridge costing 12p to travel over. The original 1885 act didn't allow for inflation to be calculated into the ferry cost, hence some highly affordable ferries outside of Manchester.]]></summary>

The daughter of Byzantine aristocrats, Angelos Benizelos and Syrigi Palaiologina, she was born into wealth and luxury. In 1536, she was married against her will to a nobleman at the age of 14. After three years, her husband died in 1539.

After his death, Regoula turned to prayer, charity work, and managed the family’s philanthropic efforts until her parents died in 1549. In 1550, Regoula became a nun, took the name “Philothei” and, in 1551, founded a nunnery in honor of St. Andrew the Apostle on the site of a ruined 1st-century Christian basilica.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The bell of King Seongdeok of Silla, also known as Emile Bell ("emile" meaning "mommy" in the Silla language) is one of South Korea's National Treasures (#29), so it makes sense that reproductions of this important object are often used by the country's government as gifts of goodwill. One of the best-known examples is found in Los Angeles, while Mexico City has a pair of its own.

The first of these was gifted in 2010 and can be found in the Parque Bicentenario (Bicentennial Park), on the city's northwest. The other, donated two years later, is located more centrally, right in front of the well-known Mothers' Monument. Both are smaller than the original, although still impressive in their dimensions. Weighing nearly one ton, the bronze bells are four feet (1.4 meters) tall and with a diameter of 80 centimeters.

Despite the two-year difference between their giftings, these two bells were given by the South Korean government in order to celebrate the centennial of the start of the Mexican Revolution, and the bicentennial of the start of the War of Independence, both commemorated in 2010.

The 2012 date is also appropriate as it represented 50 years since diplomatic relations between South Korea and Mexico were established. Their respective plaques have text in both Spanish and Korean.]]></summary>

Toby Cubitt of University College London is visiting UT Austin.  We’ve been discussing the question: can you produce a  witness state using a closed timelike curve?  Since QMA⊆PSPACE, and since Fortnow, Watrous, and I  closed timelike curves (or anyway, Deutsch’s model of them) let you solve PSPACE problems, clearly a closed timelike curve lets you solve QMA  problems, but that’s different from producing the actual witness state as the fixed-point of a polynomial-time superoperator.  Toby has a , which has as a corollary that you can produce the ground state of a local…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nothing washes ashore here but seaweed and bones. The island is Inishtrahull, or Inis Trá Tholl in Irish, which roughly translates as "island of the hollow beach," Ireland's most northerly island. Though uninhabited now, it once had a small resident community for many years. As rural a life you could live was the islanders who once called Inishtrahull home.

A low plateau sits in the middle of the island, bookended by two rocky pinnacles. The southern of those high points is home to the Inishtrahull Lighthouse, first built in 1813. For a time, lighthouse keepers, fishermen, and their families made up a small community that mostly occupied the plateau in the central part of the island. At its peak in 1911, there were 80 residents living on the remote island.

Over time, fishing by large trawlers depleted the stock in the waters around Inishtrahull. People started leaving the island, and the remaining residents evacuated in 1929. In the following decades, only a lighthouse keeper called the small island home. A new lighthouse was built in the 1950s, and when it was automated a few decades later the island was left without any residents at all.

There are no trees or hedges. But its abundance of nature flowers and fauna make it the perfect location for seabirds, and the tidal sound makes it an attractive stopping point for grey seals. The island has been designated as an area of special conservation interest.

Today, the center of the island is scattered with ruins of old stone cottages and the school masters house and school. There is also a small graveyard. And the shell of the old lighthouse 1812 watches over its sister lighthouse, which claims the title of Ireland's most northernmost lighthouse. For many emigrating from Ireland, it was the last bit of home they saw on their journey to the United States. “Inishtrahull lighthouse off the coast of Donegal was the last glimpse emigrants would have of Ireland," according to the account of one of those emigrants. "Everyone stayed on deck until it disappeared.”]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["La Via delle Pietre" ("The Path of Stones") is located along a country road at the base of Monte Cereto, in the village of Albino. It is around 114 feet (35 meters) long and consists of more than 1,000 carved stones. This is the creation of a local artist named Remo Ponti, who can often be found on-site creating new artwork.

Ponti was a metalworker by training and profession, but his true calling was art. In 2014, he decided to turn a rural stone wall into a work of art, and it took him six years to complete.

The themes of these carved stones are as varied as they can be—animals, faces, everyday objects, geometric patterns, and abstract compositions. As Ponti unravels the symbolism behind each stone, it becomes clear that these stones are the repository of his life experience, emotions, and philosophy. 

A wide face on a stone may represent the executioner who lost his job following the invention of the guillotine, but he rejoices at the occasional chance of wielding his axe again. On another stone is the wing of a butterfly, with a minuscule stylized human figure on the side, representing the artist facing the beauty and complexity of the natural world, and ultimately, the universe. Contemplating the variety of themes on the wall is as gratifying as learning about their hidden meaning. Ponti manufactured all the different chisels and hammers that he used to create his art.]]></summary>

AJ Michalka knew she had found something special on the antique site Foundwell. With a delicate interlinking strap and circular face, the 1959 Audemars Piguet (AP) Disco Volante was the perfect piece to commemorate a return to music. It was 2017, and she and her sister, Aly Michalka, after a 10-year hiatus, had just released their first EP as the pop duo AJ & Aly, fittingly named Ten Years. A watch seemed like just the thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the residential neighborhoods of Winthrop, Massachusetts, there are many homes and townhouses that line the streets close to the scenic shoreline. However, there is one home that seems to stick out considerably from the rest. Although it may appear out of place, this house has long been here before the others and has the distinction of being the oldest continuously occupied home in the United States.

The house was owned by Deane Winthrop, the sixth son of John Winthrop who the town is named after. The house was originally built in 1637 by Captain William Pierce and acquired by Deane in 1647. It was remodeled and rebuilt several times with the current structure dating to around 1675 with an addition later added in 1696.

Today, the home is owned by the Winthrop Improvement and Historical Association and houses a wide array of historical artifacts such as a 1641 Bible written in classical Greek, dishes from China ordered in 1775, a Springfield musket made in 1823, and an assortment of furniture hundreds of years old. But it still serves as a private residence the same as it did almost 350 years ago from Puritans, Minuteman, and homeowners today.

If you have an interest in early American history and would like to see the oldest still lived-in home in the country, the Deane Winthrop House is certainly worth a visit.]]></summary>

The home base is made from a green plastic crate propped on a tire, and the players stand in an outfield, stark figures against an expansive horizon.

His ball strikes the ground far ahead of the plate, and the batter stands straight as if to say, ‘Come on? Really?’

Arnold, still years away from becoming the nation's most infamous traitor, sacrificed several vessels in what would be called the Battle of Valcour Island, after one of the islands dotting the narrow, deep lake that stretches from Québec south along the New York-Vermont border. The clash ended in defeat for Arnold, but bought valuable time for the Continental Army.

The Spitfire was among the ships lost as Arnold and his men retreated—but it was not the end of the story for the gunboat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Down over 140 steep, twisting, stone stairs lie the ruins of Kinbane Castle. The name comes from the Irish "An Cionn Ban" meaning "white head," a reference to the craggy limestone rocks the castle sits atop.  Brave visitors who descend the cliff path can view spectacular cliffs, explore the ruins, and view Rathlin Island across the water.

Kinbane Castle was built in 1547 by Colla MacDonnell, of the Scottish clan of MacDonnell, lords of the Western Isles of Scotland. The only access point was by climbing down the basalt cliff face, as the castle was nearly impossible to access via the sea. Little written documentation remains to detail the history of the castle, though an information panel near the ruins gives visitors a tour of the remaining elements and sheds light on how the castle may have looked.

The castle changed hands over the centuries with local tradition suggesting it may have been inhabited until the 18th century. According to one of the NIEA plaques, test excavations at the site in 2011 did not find anything dating later than the 16th century.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Parvati Hill has historically been an essential part of Pune’s culture and heritage. The hill is known for its iconic temple complex, museum, memorial, and cave.

On the top of the hill, between the Devdeveshwar Temple and the Peshwa Museum, in a beautiful garden stands a more-than-300-year-old living witness of history. It's a huge White Frangipani tree (Plumeria rubra). The tree is also known as Temple Tree, Dev Chaph, or Pandhra (White) Chapha.

The frangipani tree is not native to India and is found in Mexico and Central America. According to historians, the Portuguese brought the tree along with them and first planted these trees in Goa, followed by the Konkan region, and later, Pune. Across India, these trees can be commonly seen planted next to temples.

Nanasaheb Peshwa built this temple complex in 1749. Historians believe that the Chapha tree has existed on this hill since before the temple was constructed and may be the oldest tree in the city.

The tree is a beautiful sight to behold. It stands tall in a tranquil courtyard surrounded by the peace of the temple. It has witnessed centuries of the city’s history and is now under the care of the temple trust and authorities.]]></summary>

The trail itself runs on a generally northeast-to-southwesterly trajectory, beginning just across the street from the governor's mansion, and continuing alongside the state capitol building, through downtown Pierre, and to the banks of the Missouri River.

Months after he buried it in darkness, Régis Hauser still dreamt of “the beast.” Of the hole he dug at 3:30 a.m. on April 24, 1993, three feet deep somewhere in France. How he lugged the hunk of metal from his car trunk and placed it in the dirt. When he told his tale to the French newspaper Libération, he made the entombment sound faintly gothic: “I hadn’t even finished, and my hands were bloody. When it was done, I went far away, to get breakfast. I looked at myself in the mirror at the cafe. I was barely recognizable, disheveled, covered in earth.” No one had seen him in the act, or so Hauser hoped. Years later, he recounted seeing just one person during his whole expedition: a dog walker looking…]]></summary>

“The Sky Was Dark With Bees”

by Michael Levinson, The New York Times

“The sky was dark with bees,” said one beekeeper on the scene after a trailer carrying five million bees was involved in a traffic accident in southern Ontario. Another couldn’t hear his cell phone ring over the drone of the confused insects. “When you’re in that cloud of bees, it’s actually quite loud—a million little helicopters flying around you.” The New York Times has the story of how the province’s bee specialist “swarmed” to save the day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Ravi, two remarks:

1) In the discussion of 9.4.3. (pp. 264-265) you repeatedly write \pi^{-1} instead of (presumably) \pi^\sharp when talking about pulling back functions.

2) In the discussion immediately after Theorem 18.1.2. (cohomology of line bundles on projective space) you mention that its top cohomology group is generated by the homogeneous degree-m Laurent polynomials in (x_0 ... x_n)^{-1} k[x_0 ... x_n]. After following the calculations in section 18.3. I feel like it should be the module of homogeneous degree-m Laurent polynomials, in which every variable appears in negative degree, i.e. the degree-m part of (x_0 ... x_n)^{-1} k[x_0^{-1} ... x_n^{-1}].]]></summary>

“They [ancient Egyptian texts] say that when ‘people die, they rot, they decay, they stink, and they will become countless worms.’ This is how they describe it,” says Barbara Huber, doctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany. “If you stink it means your body is already decaying—a bad, bad thing. So in order to be able to live for eternity, you need to smell good.”

But the traditional foods of her mother’s Karuk community lived in the shadow of the big flavors of cheesy pastas from her father's Italian family. "Her contribution was really the part that sustained our lives," she says, "but his was the part that made it taste good."

After she left for college at 16, Calvosa Olson worked to keep her Karuk heritage at arm's length for many years. Only much later did she see how lucky she was to know those foods and traditions. “I realized so many of my peers that I went to school with, they didn’t have the same connection, even growing up on the Rez,” she says. “They didn’t know how to filet a salmon.” Many came from families where elders had been sent …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[War can leave behind strange legacies. One such odd creation is the existence of Via Ferrata, or "iron path," a system of steel rungs and cables built into the side of mountains.

During World War I in the Dolomites mountains of Italy, the mountainous peaks became the heated site of battle between the Austro-Hungarians and Italians. Fixed lines of steel cable were installed to help transport goods so climbers could clip into the lines and be less afraid of falling to their deaths. It was a brutal, icy, battle on those mountains, with soldiers freezing, starving, and falling to their deaths when they weren't being shot at or blown up. However, after the fighting was done, the Via Ferrata remained, ready for adventurous climbers to clip in.

Decades later, during World War II, and halfway around the world in West Virginia, the 10th Mountain Division was training to fight on very similar terrain in the Apennines of Italy. To do so, they used the closest analog they could find: Nelson Rocks.

The Nelson Rocks, situated in the Monongahela National Forest, are famous for their two fins, thin ridges of rock bursting up 800 feet above the streams running through the forest below. Built in 2002, by private owner Stu Hammett, the Via Ferrata is one of only three found on the east coast of the United States.

Climbers go up over 1000 feet of elevation and cross a 200-foot-long suspension bridge on the trip. One of the real draws of Via Ferrata is that it allows non-climbers to take routes, and access heights that would otherwise be too dangerous or technical for them.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kansas is known for its flatness, and sometimes it feels as though the sky can stretch across the whole horizon. In Newton, Kansas, a group of talented artists have created a majestic sculpture to harness and evoke this feeling of the expansive sky.

Completed in 2001, the Blue Sky Sculpture was created “to blend with the natural sky,” as a plaque at the viewing stand suggests, which “requires a patient and contemplative viewer.”

Painter Phil Epp worked with ceramicists Terry Corbett and Conrad Snider to create an arced and undulating structure, where the cobalt blue glaze of the ceramic tiles and fluffy white painted clouds reflect the color of the sky throughout the day. Viewers are encouraged to stand in between the sculptures, in what is known as the “sky passageway.” To complete the motif, two giant abstract stoneware figures stand next to the sculpture, further encouraging interactivity.

The sculpture was donated by local philanthropist and inventor Lloyd E. Smith in memory of his wife, Jacqueline, and has since become a symbol of the community, inspiring further designs and being named one of the Eight Wonders of Kansas Art.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There may not be a more welcoming sight than a cool bottle of milk on a hot summer day, and Oklahoma City aims to please. Since 1948, Oklahoma City has displayed its beacon of dairy goodness to thirsty travelers making their way across the Mother Road. 

The wedge-shaped red brick building was already an unusual sight on Classen Boulevard when it was built in 1930, as it was one of Oklahoma City’s few triangular lots. At the time, Classon Boulevard was part of Route 66 itself, and the grocery building would be a stop on the streetcar line that ran along the street. In 1948, the milk bottle was added, as a prime example of roadside mimetic architecture, where it has stood ever since. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.

Curiously, the building and the milk bottle have always been separate establishments. The building itself, with its unusual size and foot traffic, has hosted several businesses, including a banh mi shop, a barbecue shack, a design studio, and a private nail salon. Likewise, the milk bottle has had a number of different dairy companies adorn it as an advertisement. Currently, the milk bottle bears the logo of Braum’s, the beloved Okie dairy farm, grocery, and fast food chain that has stores across the state.]]></summary>

However, the center of the city of Mannheim, Germany, which is referred to as the Quadratestadt (or Quadrate in English) uses a completely different system. The streets, most of which have no name, are organized as a grid that is rotated slightly clockwise from the cardinal directions, and addresses are assigned according to the building’s location in one of the blocks within the grid.

It's Macdonald's first time taking part in the park's annual bat monitoring program, and this task—working out whether the bat is a juvenile or adult by examining its wing development—is particularly fiddly, especially when you're wearing thick leather gloves to protect against bat bites. “It’s like trying to roll a cigarette with wet paper!” he says.

While helping teammates clip small fur samples for DNA analysis, Macdonald found the bats “pretty strong and feisty little animals… Th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 2013 reality television series Konstkuppen (translated as “The Art Coup”), six well-known artists in six different Swedish cities had six days to collaborate with locals in order to create a new public art piece. One of the participants was artist and comedian Peter Apelgren. He chose Osby, the hometown of his mother-in-law, as the location for crafting his artwork, Apan och Kaninen ("The Bunny and Monkey"), and enlisted the help of local artist Sven-Ingvar Johansson, who is an expert in carving animal figures with chainsaws.

Towering at 15 feet (4.5 meters) and constructed from cellular plastic and fiberglass cloth, the animal figures were modeled after two of Apelgren’s childhood toys. The artist wanted to make something "kind and childlike" as a nod to renowned toy manufacturer BRIO, which was based in Osby for over 100 years and runs a popular toy museum in town. 

While some locals found the colossal animal duo comical and jokingly called it Sweden's modern answer to the Easter Island statues, others thought the large sculptures ruined the scenic lakefront and that they should be moved to a playground instead. 

After being vandalized a few times, the artwork was eventually set on fire one summer night in 2013. As a result, the monkey figure was reduced to ashes and the rabbit figure was scorched. However, thanks to local businesses and the Municipality of Osby, the animal pair was restored and re-inaugurated two years later.]]></summary>

The narrow pathways wind through tightly packed houses, revealing medieval courtyards, while the streets below bustle with a multitude of people, cars, and motorcycles that seem to multiply infinitely, painting a portrait of a city bursting at the seams.

Long ago, when the city was but a humble settlement, more than 400 stone water spouts were scattered around Kathmandu, standing like guardians of the life-giving liquid. The taps, locally known as dhunge dharas or hitis, have been an integral part of the city's communal water supply for centuries. Predating the introduction of modern pipes in the 1890s, these systems were constructed around 1,500 years ago. Typically made of intricately carved stone, the s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than just a way to cross over the River Wear, Elvet Bridge hides chapels, a prison, and possible hidden arches.

The Prince Bishop, Hugh de Puiset, had construction started in 1160.  However, he never saw it finished as it took a long time for construction to be completed with records showing that in 1228 the church was still granting indulgences to people helping in its construction. (An indulgence was a way for someone to reduce their punishment in the afterlife for sins committed while alive.)

Not much of this original bridge remains—only one of the current arches dates from the 12th century, and the other arches are part of the 13th-century construction.

This leads to the first unusual story of Elvet Bridge.  While the bridge is described as having 10 arches, there have long …]]></summary>

Mercury is a wasteland. It is an overbaked, Sun-blasted, empty little rock, more like the inner core of a world than a proper planet like its brethren Earth, Venus, and Mars. Mercury will never be a target in the search for extraterrestrial life. It would be almost as difficult to visit as Pluto or the Sun itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many people may not know that there are actually two museums celebrating the Grammy Awards. The first is located in the L.A. Live complex, just steps from the arena where the Grammy Awards are most often held. The second, naturally, is located in the small town of Cleveland, Mississippi, two hours away from the nearest big city.

So… what are artifacts from the most famous pop music stars and a massive museum with interactive exhibits doing in a place like Cleveland? There are a few answers. The answer the Grammy Museum Mississippi offers is that Cleveland is located in the Mississippi Delta, as one of a string of music museums dotting the landscape of the cradle of American music along the Mississippi Blues Trail between Memphis and Jackson. Additionally, the proximity to Delta State University gives it an educational function. A more cynical answer may have to do with the flow of economic development funding to Mississippi in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and how much of it was used on major white elephant projects instead of direct aid to its residents.

Either way, the GRAMMY Museum Mississippi is a striking 28,000-square-foot building that combines L.A. glitz with Delta architectural vernacular. Exhibits include outfits worn by popstars including Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Charli XCX, and more, alongside exhibits of blues greats such as Bobby Rush and local legend B.B. King. 

A special spotlight is placed on Mississippi music legends from Jimmie Rodgers through today, including Elvis Presley, who was born in Tupelo. Finally, the museum includes films, theatrical presentations, and a soundstage and studio, with interactive exhibits on the blues to help you hone your skills on your way to a Grammy nomination of your own.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finchale Priory was founded in 1196 upon the site of St. Godric's Hermitage. Originally a sailor, although some would say a pirate, St. Godric visited Lindisfarne, where he underwent a religious conversion and gave up a life on the seas to devote his life to religion. (Godric was never formally canonized, so the term "saint" is a bit of a misnomer.)

Following a long illness, perhaps brought on by the hardship of his self-imposed ascetic lifestyle which included sleeping outdoors in all weather, Godric died in 1170. After his death, two monks were sent to occupy the hermitage. 

The main buildings of the priory date to 1237, and the church was completed in 1277. It didn't become a priory in its own right after Henry du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham's son was convinced to bestow upon it sa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neodesha, Kansas is the birthplace of the great plains oil boom. The replica oil well found in this small Kansas town is a symbol of the discovery that reshaped America.

The commercial petroleum industry got its start in 1859 in Pennsylvania, and eventually enterprises were set up across the Appalachian basin. By the 1890s, rumors of glowing gas springs that abounded in southeast Kansas led local citizens to encourage William Mills, a Pennsylvania oil prospector, to come to town to supply natural gas to the residents of Neodesha. 

After surveying several plots of land, Mills eventually chose the four-acre garden of local blacksmith T.J. Norman and began drilling on the banks of the Verdigris River. On November 28, 1892, Mills struck oil at 832 feet underground. The site became the firs…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a little walk away from the Royal Castle in Warsaw (Zamek Królewski w Warszawie) in the city's historic center is a church with an odd piece of decoration.

During renovations to the church in the late 18th century, workers discovered a mammoth skeleton while digging a new foundation. Ever since a colossal bone from the find has been on display within the historic church.  

This church is one of two churches in Warsaw dedicated to St. Anne. The church with the mammoth bone, St. Anne's Church or Kościół św. Anny, is in the city center: The second church, the Belfry at St. Anne, is in in the historic Wilanów district where King John III Sobieski of Poland's Wilanów Palace is located. The two churches mark the beginning and end of the Royal Route, which connects the Royal Castle with Wilanów Palace.

Initially, the 14th-century Church of St. Leonard stood on this site. Later, in 1772, Prince August Adam Czartoryski commissioned architect Jan Kotelnicki to rebuild the church using bricks in a Neoclassical style. It was during this second phase of construction that the mammoth skeleton was discovered. The newly renovated church was renamed St. Anne's Church.

In the second half of the 19th century, the church was renovated in a Neo-Rennaisance style by Enrico Marconi, Leonardo Marconi, and Jan Huss. Sculptor Bolesław Syrewicz also made sculptures to dot the church's façades and the wall decorations were added by Antoni Kolberg.

The church survived both World Wars with minimal damage, and today is one of Warsaw's oldest buildings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 1968 Tlatelolco Massacre is almost certainly the best-known case of the country's government reacting with deadly force to student protests, but it was not the last one. Just three years later on June 10, the Feast of Corpus Christi, a paramilitary group known as Los Halcones (The Hawks) repressed another student protest in Mexico City, with around 120 victims. Due to the date and perpetrators, this would come to be known as both the Halconazo and Corpus Christi Massacre.

As had been the case in the entire country's modern democracy, and up to 2000, the ruling party was the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). At the time, the authorities maintained that the Halcones were an independent organization. In the following years however, direct connections were established between the group and the PRI, several institutions of the Mexico City government, and even the CIA, as there have been suspicions that they assisted in their training. This goes to show that, even as a paramilitary organization, the Halcones enacted the massacre under the auspices of the city and national authorities.

Forty years later, this sculpture was installed outside the city's Escuela Normal (Teaching School) as this was the alma mater of many of the victims of the massacre. Its sculptor, Enrique Carbajal (known as Sebastián), was actually arrested and held in a military prison in 1968, so his role as the artist behind this piece is symbolic. Additionally, he has often been commissioned for public artworks, usually in a signature monochrome, abstract style.

The 2011 sculpture, which might be officially titled Sangre Derramada ("Spilled Blood"), although this is unclear, represents several elements related to the massacre. At the bottom, a Christian cross ties the monument to the Corpus Christi date. Atop, glyphs similar to those used by the country's pre-Columbian cultures are piled up to form a 15-meter-tall structure. The monument is completed by a plaque listing the names of 40 of the victims of that day.]]></summary>

One part of the answer is a combination of American political institutions and changes in the nature of parties.  The institutions worked reasonably well when parties were loosely organized and not very ideological, but when the parties are ideological, they create bad incentives for politicians.  One reason is the dominance of the two-party system means that negative partisanship can be at least as effective as trying to make …]]></summary>

Next to it, a comparatively tiny human struggles to keep up, swimming by the creature's side. While the tag-along may seem like an eager tourist, it’s actually a scientist imitating one.

His fellow researchers look on via boat and drone, taking aerial footage of how the largest fish in the sea—the whale shark—responds to “tourists” frantically trying to keep up with them in the hope of a once-in-a-lifetime wildlife experience. But for the sharks, this attention is a double-edged sword. People can be annoying, but their love—and tourist dollars—can help protect the massive, docile sharks.

Heinabergslón Lagoon is fed from the Heinabergsjokull glacier, which is part of the larger Vatnajökull ice cap. When the water melts, it pools in lagoons, such as Heinabergslón. Because of the tumultuous geology of this region, the melting water often carries volcanic dust, making the water in these basins quite murky. However, Heinabergslón is more than 330 feet deep, enabling the detritus to sit at the bottom of the lagoon, leaving the water at the surface crystal clear.

Local artist Mitchell Gaudet cast and built the piece titled “Guardian’s Wall” featuring 34 glass faces set in an 8-foot tall 35-foot-wide structure. The installation alongside neighboring benches with memorial bricks offers a place to reflect, heal, and understand the human toll of the AIDS epidemic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Located on the Boulevard of Nikola Tesla, Hotel Yugoslavia is a historic hotel located in Belgrade, the former capital of the state after which the building is named. It holds great cultural and historical significance as one of the city's most iconic landmarks, holding nostalgic value for many people who remember its role as a luxurious meeting place in Yugoslavia. What's more, it was visited by a plethora of highly renowned international celebrities, politicians, athletes, and artists since its construction, including Queen Elizabeth II, Richard Nixon, Neil Armstrong, and Belgian and Dutch royals.

After it was built in 1969, the hotel quickly became a symbol of the modernization and progress of Yugoslavia. It was designed by a team of prominent Yugoslav architects led by Lavoslav Horvat, and features a distinctive Brutalist architectural style on the banks of the Danube. Over the years, the hotel has undergone renovations to update its facilities and amenities while preserving its architectural character.

In its heyday, it was a five-star hotel, laced with chandeliers and lavish silver and gold elements, but today it is a more affordable three-star hotel that offers a range of comfortable accommodations. It is without a doubt that the hotel has faced challenges and changes over the years such as being severely damaged in the NATO bombing of the 90s. It will, however, eternally remain a recognizable symbol of Belgrade's history and architectural heritage. 

Today, Hotel Jugoslavija continues to welcome guests from around the world, offering a blend of modern comforts, historic charm, and beautiful riverfront views. It serves as a reminder of the city's past, with many solemn documentaries such as Hotel Yugoslavia (2017) having been filmed about the once full-of-life hotel in the quaint neighborhood of Zemun.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open since the 1950s, this unique gift shop and roadside attraction is carved into the side of a cave.

Originally, this area was a natural feature, locally known as the Ice Cave, carved from the nearby Rio Ruidoso. The land was used by the Mescalero Apache nation and may have been a sanctuary for Geronimo, the legendary Apache leader. Later, it was purportedly used by Billy the Kid as a hideout. These facts are likely "history-ish," but Billy the Kid did live along the trail that now bears his name, and famously escaped from the nearby Lincoln County Courthouse.

In the early 1950s, the store’s unique structure was built, and in 1954, it was sold to George Fuchs, along with his wife Mildred. Fuchs renamed Ice Cave the Fox Cave, pronounced like his last name. The store was a popular roadside stop along Highway 70 through the 1950s, but its legacy faded over time.

The site had been long abandoned when Arnold Duke, a gemologist and proprietor of the nearby Ruidoso River Museum, purchased it in 2010. Putting some care into its rehabilitation, the site has reopened as a mid-century style tourist trap, although one with an unusually strong gem collection. The place is replete with aliens, dinosaurs, relics of the Old West, and all sorts of curios to browse or purchase, all while standing within the cave’s walls.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Resting about 12 miles from the small subarctic town of Churchill, Manitoba, the MV Ithaka has become one of the area's iconic landmarks. Although best known for polar bears and beluga whales, Churchill also offers two large wrecks—the Ithaka and the Miss Piggy cargo plane—as tourist attractions. Surrounded by water at high tide, the former may be visited on foot when the tide is out or in winter when the bay freezes.

Built as a lake freighter in Quebec, Canada, for the George Hall Coal Company, the Ithaka was originally christened the Frank A. Augsbury and launched on October 21, 1922. After several ownership, name, and cargo changes—including carrying out transport service during World War II—the ship was sold for the last time in 1960 to the Ithaka Shipping Company and registered to a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ting1, completed in 2013 in Örnsköldsvik, is one of Sweden’s most remarkable residential buildings, captivating with its vibrant colors, distinctive architecture, and innovative construction. Its façade of glazed high-gloss ceramics stands in striking contrast to the gray brutalist concrete of the 1967 courthouse it sits on top of.

The new building appears perched on the courthouse’s roof, yet no physical contact exists between the two structures due to a discreetly positioned 26-foot by 26-foot base in the old building’s courtyard, creating a clever architectural composition reminiscent of a substantial mushroom with its stem securely anchored within the enclosed plaza.

Designed by acclaimed architect Gert Wingårdh, Ting1 boasts 11 floors and a façade featuring 78 glass balconies offering stunning views of the High Coast region’s landscape, including the iconic ski jumping hills. This design contributes to the building’s artistic vibrancy, drawing inspiration from a pixelated version of the late regional artist Bengt Lindström’s oil painting Women's Dance.

Ting1, called "the LEGO house" or "the Coronavirus" by some locals, stirs both acclaim and controversy. It was a finalist for the Swedish Building of the Year 2014 award and won the Great Tile Award that year. However, differing opinions emerged, labeling it as "Ångermanland Province's ugliest building" in a local 2016 poll, and it was critically spotlighted by the Arkitektupproret (Architectural Uprising) movement, which fights against modernism. This mix of accolades and critiques vividly shapes Ting1's unique standing in architectural discussions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omar Khayyam, best known for his poetry Rubáiyát, was a Persian polymath learned in the ways of astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics. Born in the ancient city of Nishapur, he died in 1131 B.C. at 83 and was buried in his hometown.

The poet’s tomb survived the test of time through Mongol invasions and natural disasters, developing into part of a shrine. In 1934, the Iranian government under the Pahlavi dynasty commissioned the reconstruction of his mausoleum, which would be completed 31 years later.

Designed by the architect Hooshang Seyhoun, the new Omar Khayyam Mausoleum is an outstanding beauty many consider a masterpiece of modern Persian architecture. A large marble monument standing in a serene garden, it is decorated with verses from Rubáiyát written in the taʿlīq script, glowing in an oasitic blue shade.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August we invited animal lovers to send us their favorite images of creatures they've encountered in their explorations. We at Atlas Obscura have always been fascinated by critters big and small—their secret lives, what they tell us about the world and ourselves—so we wanted to know: What in the animal kingdom catches your eye?

You showed us horses galloping through fields, lionesses with cubs, and bees on colorful flowers. Most of all, we saw a lot of birds: startling close-ups, in magnificent mid-flight, and congregating en masse with their feathered friends.
Check out the delightful winning photos (click to see them up close) selected by our staff—the first place winner is above. We hope these images will endear you to the living beings we share the world with.

Congratulations to our winners, who scored some Atlas Obscura gear! And thanks to everyone who shared wonderful images with us this summer. Be sure to check out the winners of our other two contests, for Roadside Attractions and Night Views, and definitely stay tuned for more chance to share your photos with us and score some Atlas Obscura prizes!

At the Bangkok Coin Museum, an institution run by the Treasury Department, curious visitors can learn the fascinating history of Thai currencies. Despite its proximity to the National Museum and the Sanam Luang Park, it's a lesser-known and under-appreciated tourist attraction, making it a neat oasis from the tropical heat and sightseeing crowds outside.

At first glance, the museum seems quite small with only a single exhibit room on the first floor. There are educational panels on the general history of money, from the invention of coinage in ancient Lydia to the development of modern Thai baht. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pune has grown over the centuries under the reign and control of various kingdoms, cultures and empires. Every culture has left its own unique mark on the way the city has taken shape and today one can find history around every corner, quaintly hidden, ready to present itself to curious enthusiasts. Particularly in the older parts of the city, every street, every square, every alley, and every corner has a story to tell. 

There are artistic wooden beams next to imposing stone walls, clock towers next to historic stairs, arched doorways next to grand bastions, and old lamps next to rustic windows. Right opposite the magnificent Shanivar Wada, almost hidden from the world passing by, is an extremely old flight of stairs. Surrounded by residential buildings and old structures, these stairs …]]></summary>

In this episode of The Atlas Obscura Podcast, we visit the small town of Ballyvadlea in County Tipperary, Ireland, where a horrendous murder occurred in March 1895. In front of friends and family, Michael Cleary murdered his wife Bridget after accusing her of being replaced by a fairy. Today the murder tells us far more about sexism than Irish fairy lore. 

Our podcast is an audio guide to the world’s wondrous, awe-inspiring, strange places. In under 15 minutes, we’ll take you to an incredible site, and along the way you’ll meet some fascinating people and hear their stories. Join us daily, Monday through Thursday, to explore a new wonder with cofounder Dylan Thuras and a neighborhood of Atlas Obscura reporters.]]></summary>

Recently, my friend Rachel found a pile of 1980s cookbooks on a curb and gave them to me as a housewarming present. The one that caught my eye was The JCPenney Microwave Cookbook, with its colorful cover showing a rack of lamb, roast beef, and a ham, all presumably cooked in a microwave. 
  The whole book is a peek into the past, to a time when microwaves were the hot, new appliance. “Welcome to the most versatile system of food preparation ever devised by man,” boasts the inner cover. The cookbook sets out to prove that statement with recipes for dishes that people today would never, ever, cook in a microwave.

As one of the few remaining single-screen theaters, It was rescued from the brink of demolition in 2001, and a non-profit dedicated to its upkeep, Pelham Picture House Preservation, was established. It has since been rebranded as The Pelham Picture House Regional Film Center and added to the National Registry of Historic Places in 2010.

Celebrating its centennial in 2021 did not only celebrate its resiliency as a cultural hub but also the countless community events that it proudly hosted and displayed on the marquee, including (but by no means limited to) watching a local Olympians race live on the big screen, children's parties, and school events.

So whether you're a film lover, a history buff, or just someone who is looking to eat some good old-fashioned popcorn, the Picture House is the perfect way to spend your afternoon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many cities have founding myths that explain some aspect of their history and sometimes their name. Kielce, a city in southern Poland, is no different, though their story certainly is quite unique. A statue on the town square depicts a large imposing boar, which is situated on top of a pedestal and surrounded by six brass plates that tell its story.  

The story centers around Prince  Mieszko Bolesławowic, son of the 11th-century Polish King Bolesław II. The prince was sent out into the woods with a large army escort on a hunting trip after the king got into an argument with the Bishop of Krakow and feared for his son's life in retaliation.  

In the woods, the prince and his men found and slayed many beasts, while living an otherwise unremarkable life. That is until one day, when Prince Mieszko saw a giant boar and decided to follow it on his own. This nearly ended in tragedy as he drove into a branch and was knocked out cold.

While he was unconscious, the prince dreamt that someone had given him poison and that he was dying. However, just before the end Saint Wojciech appeared and healed the prince with cleansing water that appeared from a spot below his cane. The prince woke up to discover that he had been found and helped by his men. To his surprise, he also saw the river from his dreams, and also a pair of large boar tusks (Kły) on the place where he was knocked out. 

He decided to build a city here on this holy spot, and called it after the boar's tusks: Kielce.]]></summary>

Though it is many miles from the sites of the attacks on that tragic day, the 9/11 Memorial Trail in Athens, Georgia, is filled with meaning. 

After a trip to New York City just one month after the attacks, artist Bob Hart—who had been moved by the hushed reverence of the other passengers on his flight, then the flowers and missing posters on the chain link fences—decided that he had to do something to help others remember those whose lives had been lost. The final result of his work is a 300-yard wooded trail on his property that has been visited by people from across the country for more than 20 years.

The wellhead was commissioned by Thomas Billingham as a gift to the city at a time when safe, fresh water was not always easy to locate. The wellhead protected the water source and preserved the quality of the water in the well.  These wellheads were the first line of defense for preventing contaminants from entering the water supply.

The wellhead at Fram is a low, rectangular structure with buttresses on each corner and a sloped roof. There is a now bricked doorway on the south-facing side and a small slot along the east side.

The wellhead is a Grade II listed building and was first listed in 1952.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the Peephole Cinema in San Francisco, this small-scale destination for bibliophiles is similarly out of view, tucked up against a building in a tree-lined urban alleyway/POPOS (no, not police officers, but a Privately-Owned Public Open Space) in Downtown San Francisco.

The store inhabits three showcase windows just two feet deep and 14 feet wide. Once a display space for the I. Magnin & Co. department store, it's now a thoughtfully curated selection of books, zines, art, and other paper ephemera, as well as a few book carts on wheels. The space found its second life as a bookstore in 2012, when G.F. “Rick” Wilkinson transformed the former display windows into a small bookstore. It became a fixture in the neighborhood.

When Wilkinson decided to close the store in order to focus on his online bookselling business, a new group took over running the beloved store, which was renamed 34 Trinity Arts and News.

Run by a dedicated cadre of volunteers, this diminutive oasis of reading materials (with a focus on San Francisco-based writers, authors, and subjects) provides a much-needed respite from the glass and steel monoliths that loom over it. 34 Trinity occasionally collaborates with other local businesses to host various events including art exhibitions and poetry readings.]]></summary>

According to the Sufi, the djinns were created by Allah when the world was new, fashioned from fire while mankind was made from clay.

Like most great works of art, Otto began his life as a high school shop project, the brainchild of shop teacher Tom Willett, who wanted to create something special for Fergus Falls’s centennial in 1972. Unfortunately, the first version of Otto was…an otter disaster. Steve Jaenisch, a metal artist who went on to create a number of sculptures around town, finished the job and made sure Otto would last for generations to come.

Today, the 40-foot-long otter sculpture stands proudly in Adams Park, overlooking the lake. The quaint city park also includes a ballfield, a playground, and picnic tables, including one that is often placed tantalizingly close to Otto.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This water storage facility, which also controls Bangor’s water pressure, has been in use since 1897. It also inspired a piece of Stephen King's 1986 novel It: the standpipe in Derry, where Stan first encounters Pennywise.

Bangor’s most famous resident Stephen King once lived a few blocks away from the standpipe. According to him, he also wrote a significant portion of his book It in the shadow of the standpipe. In the early 1980s, he would walk down the street, sit on a park bench in the small park beneath the standpipe, and write the book. It is said that the tragic stairwell death of the boy in 1940 influenced the creation of the book’s character Pennywise the Clown.

There are no recorded drowning accidents in the standpipe, but for anyone who has read the book or seen either the film or the miniseries, this is an incredibly eerie place to be—even though you’re just staring at an old water tower. Which tells you everything you need to know about the power of King’s writing.

In the 2017 remake of the movie It, one of the characters bikes by a standpipe in the fictional town of Derry, which is King’s thinly disguised version of Bangor. The standpipe was CGI-generated and the movie was filmed in Toronto. There are also references to the standpipe in his other books Dreamcatcher and 11/22/63.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Last Chance Module Array was an art project created by M12 Studios in 2015. This is how M12 Studio describes it: "Alone in the landscape, it appears newly built or, just as easily, to have always been there, disintegrating over decades."

The installation is designed to align with the horizon, and lines up perfectly with the rising and setting sun during the summer and winter solstices. M12 studios states that the "design of the structures is expressive of farm and prairie architecture like barns and other farm structures.”

Even when it isn’t the solstice it is a beautiful sculpture in the middle of nowhere. There is no sign or even a path to get to the sculpture, but you can see it on the east side of the street. You’ll need to walk up a small hill and then through grasslands to get to the sculpture.

There is very little else around in Last Chance, Colorado, so there’s a part of this whole adventure that feels like one has come upon this hidden art creation that no one else knows about.]]></summary>

Mike Lohrengel looks up in awe at trees he has known for 30 years. “This is one of the most beautiful places I know. This forest has it all: the most species, the most diversity. Many trees I know individually. Look at this one behind us. It’s got a split way up there. I’ll never forget that tree till I die.”

It is a love affair, for sure. But Lohrengel is no tree-hugger, out to preserve a special, pristine place. He is a timber harvest administrator, overseeing logging in one of the most remarkable working forests in the United States—nearly a quarter-million acres of trees that occupy almost the entire Menominee Indian Reservation in northern Wisconsin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The San Jacinto Mountains, an upthrust fault block resulting from the San Andreas fault system, rise abruptly east of the Los Angeles basin. With a high point at San Jacinto Peak (10,804 feet/3,294 meters), the range is tall enough to intercept the moisture coming from the Pacific, such that the higher elevations support forests and even a winter snow cap. However, this also causes a rain-shadow desert on the eastern side of the range. The mountain precipitation feeds a number of perennial streams that drain to the east, of which one of the largest is Tahquitz (pronounced TAH-keets) Creek.

The creek drops steeply down the eastern front of the range through a spectacular canyon, from which it formerly flowed out into the desert where the city of Palm Springs now sits. As with any desert creek, its water was of paramount importance for wildlife and the local human population.

Near the base of the range, where its grade flattens out, the creek flows over a picturesque waterfall some 60 feet high that can be reached by a footpath. The path runs about 1.8 miles through a scenic desert canyon with an altitude gain of 350 feet. The level is moderate and should be within the capabilities of most hikers. Some rock art is also visible. The creek and falls both lie within the Agua Caliente Cahuilla Reservation and the tribe sells hiking permits.

Tahquitz, in the local Native American lore, was a malevolent spirit that dwelled in the mountains.]]></summary>

Think of the Gulf of Guinea, part of the South Atlantic Ocean, as Africa’s armpit. It’s the body of water just off the coast of where West Africa bends south to become Central Africa. The Gulf is right in the middle of your standard world map, and that’s no coincidence. It is the meeting point of the two baselines of geodetic measurement, the prime meridian and the equator.

The piece is made up of two diamond-studded wings perched atop a gold halo. Relatives who inherited the diamond-studded tiara wound up selling it to a Las Vegas pawn shop, a sale that was featured on the History Channel show Pawn Stars.

Museum staff had known about the tiara's existence—they had borrowed the piece from the family members a number of times over the years. But it wasn't until they saw it on TV that they knew that it was up for sale. 

After the episode aired, curators from the McKinley Presidential Library convinced Rick Harrison, co-owner of Gold & Silver Pawn, to sell it to them. He agreed on the condition that the museum was able to meet the amount he paid for it: $43,000.

The museum put together a fundraising campaign, and hundreds of donations from across the country enabled the museum to buy the tiara back. It is now on permanent display at the museum, in its original velvet jewelry box and inside a protective glass case]]></summary>

Christopher McCandless was an adventurer who went by the pseudonym "Alexander Supertramp." McCandless traveled across North America in the early 1990s. He ventured into the Alaskan bush in 1992 with minimal supplies, hoping to live off the land. Eventually, McCandless came across an abandoned bus near the Sushana River that he used as a makeshift shelter. It would also become his final resting place. 

In 1996, Jon Krakauer published Into The Wild, a book following McCandless's journey that became an international bestseller. In 2007, the book was adapted into a movie directed by Sean Penn and starring Emile Hirsch as McCandless. A replica of the so-called "Magic Bus" was created for the movie, and after filming was done it found a permanent home at 49th State Brewing.

As for the real bus. it remained at its remote site for many years, and visiting it became a pilgrimage for people who had been inspired by McCandless's story. But after at least 15 people had to be rescued and two people died attempting to cross the Teklanika River, the bus was airlifted out in June 2020. It was moved to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where there are plans to put it on display at the Museum of the North.]]></summary>

It’s important to define "organized baseball," because night baseball had been taking place off and on since the sport's creation. The earliest known game of artificially illuminated baseball took place on September 2, 1880, at Nantasket Beach, Massachusetts. Exhibition games would regularly be played with artificial lighting, however, professional sports resisted the innovation–particularly all major and minor leagues covered by the National Agreement governed by Major League Baseball.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the early 20th century, the Soudan Iron Mine awarded employees of the mine lots on neighboring Stuntz Bay on Lake Vermilion to build boathouses. The employees were tasked with supplying their own materials and labor for the construction of their boathouses. Most were built with tamarack logs and reclaimed corrugated metal from the mine.

Over 140 of these boathouses still stand today, albeit in various states of disrepair, with some renovated for continued use, and some crumbling into the bay. The boathouses now reside within the boundaries of Soudan Underground Mine State Park and have been listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.

The owners of any boathouses not already surrendered to the park will be the last generation to own them, as current rules prohibit the transfer of ownership under any circumstances. Once the owner dies or surrenders ownership, the boathouse becomes the property of the park. This leaves the fate of the boathouses uncertain, as it's likely the park will not repair or restore them once they've taken ownership.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune has one of the largest collections of rare books and manuscripts in South Asia. Within the grounds of the institute, next to the main building, stands an impressive guest house. It was built in 1933 with funds granted by Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad.

The guest house was built to accommodate the researchers and scholars who used to visit the institute for study and research. According to historians, along with the funds of Rs. 50,000/- for the construction of the guest house, the Nizam had also granted Rs. 1,000/- per year for 11 years for the publication of the Mahabharata by the institute.

 On April 15, 1948, Dr. M. R. Jayakar was appointed as the first Vice Chancellor of the University of Poona (later the University of Pune and now Savitribai Phule Pune University). He was in search of a place to establish the office of the varsity and start working, since the current university building was then the seasonal retreat and monsoon residence of the Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) and was called the Governor House.

Dr. R. N. Dandekar, the then secretary of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute suggested Dr. Jayakar to set up the university office at the Nizam’s Guest House. Soon thereafter, the office of the university was started from here and was located here until June 1, 1949.

In 1949, the University was allocated land of over 411 acres, which is its current campus. The erstwhile Governor's House has become the main office building of the university since then. 

The Nizam’s Guest House is a beautiful stately building with elegantly designed balconies, windows, corridors, and archways. It has been declared a Grade 1 Heritage Structure and is evocative of a bygone era, reminding passersby of the city’s fascinating history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Strauss Airstrip, also known locally as the Strauss Airfield, 27 Mile Field, and the Humpty Doo Strip, was a landing strip found in the Northern Territory of Australia.

It was constructed over a period between March and April of 1942 and was a key part of Australia's air defense during World War II. This is one of the most intact military installations in all of Northern Australia and was added to the Northern Territory Heritage Register due to its cultural and historic significance.

The airfield was named after United States Captain Allison W. Strauss, a P-40 Kittyhawk pilot who lost their life after crashing into Darwin Harbour during a Japanese air raid on April 27, 1942. The site was decommissioned at the end of 1945, and in recent years, information signs have been installed along with the placement of model aircraft.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This tiny store located in the Arc de Triomf area has been a temple for emo teens, goths, and kawaii lovers since 2010. But what catches the interest of visitors is to find an incredibly colorful spot in the middle of the street, with its quirky, busy tiny space decorated with a big collection of subculture relics on their walls.

The museum-like decor shows a wide variety of everything alternative youth dreams of: from "kawaii" pop culture items, Japanese toys from the 60s, vintage anime rare novelties, to the dreamed room of an emo teen. This collection is not for sale in the store (it is actually a clothing and secondhand store), so their employees ended up adding signs to avoid the many daily inquiries about purchasing.

The collection has been composed by the owners and employees throughout their lives. Every item has a little history with their respective owner, and are exposed to share the deep love for underground culture with every person that steps into the little store.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1950s, the town of Silverton, Colorado was in a troubled situation. The largest mine in the county had closed and the railroad that brought tourists from Durango was struggling. The idea for a large Christ statue in Silverton was first conceived at a Catholic men’s club in 1958. It was the hope that such a statue might revitalize the spirit of the town, and perhaps even the economy. 

The slopes of Anvil Mountain were chosen as the site for the shrine since it overlooked the entire city. The statue itself was fashioned from 12 tons of Italian Carrara marble, the same source as Michelangelo’s "David". The alcove around the statue was made from stone local to the area. The catholic church provided financial support. The townspeople of Silverton also donated their money, supplies, and labor to the project. In 1959, the statue was complete, standing an impressive 16 feet on its pedestal.

Shortly after the construction of the shrine, the Sunnyside Mine was reopened providing new employment to the citizens of Silverton. It is unknown if the new shrine played any part in the decision to reopen the mines. However, when the mines flooded in 1978, many credited the shrine for protecting the miners. While all the mines in Silverton are now closed for good, the Christ of the Mines still endures as a monument to Silverton’s history and the resilience of its people.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinnm," Luxembourgish for "We want to stay what we are," is the national motto of Luxembourg. As a very small country in the center of Western Europe, Luxembourg has braved a tumultuous history of fighting and bartering for its independence from multiple invading and occupying forces. This motto speaks to the ambition of the Luxembourgish people to retain their independence, identity, and sovereignty.

The motto is pulled from Luxembourgish patriotic song, written in 1859 by De Feierwon. In Luxembourgish, the lyrics of the chorus read: "Kommt hier aus Frankräich, Belgie, Preisen, / Mir wellen iech ons Hémecht weisen, / Frot dir no alle Säiten hin, / Mir welle bleiwe wat mir sin."

In English, this translates as: "Come here from France, Belgium, Prussia, / we want to show you our fatherland / ask in all directions, / We want to stay what we are."

Although this motto is posted in many places across Luxembourg, this version, which is painted on an ancient tower above Rue de la Loge is probably the most famous.]]></summary>

While the original Smith's and Wooddale Bridges were both built before Ashland Bridge, the former two have been rebuilt, making Ashland Bridge the oldest, original bridge in Wilmington.

On at least three occasions, this diminutive Delaware bridge has been closed down due to damage from oversized trucks. In 2021, the bridge was damaged by debris that slammed into it during Hurricane Ida. This resulted in a six-week closure in 2023, but as of August, the bridge was re-opened to traffic.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Observatories are rarely found in the middle of a city due to the light pollution emitted by the nearby houses, this makes the Urania observatory a rare and surprisingly accessible gem of Zurich.

The land on which it stands was once owned by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) and had several observatories at this location throughout the centuries. However, it was bought by a businessman named Weill-Einstein at the turn of the 18th century. The only condition was that "a beautiful building appropriate to the location of the building site be built on the building site within five years of the transfer of ownership." 

This demand was fulfilled through the construction of a public observatory.

The observatory was completed in 1907 and was the first concrete building in the city, it was also fully separate from the surrounding building to minimize vibrations. Despite this technology, no science was ever done in the tower, instead, it has always been used to teach astronomy and explain how telescopes work. 

Inside the building is a beautiful Zeiss refractor that was custom-built for this tower. The telescope has a length of 16 feet (five meters). It's described by Zeiss as a 'Urania Type.]]></summary>

Analysis is only a part of understanding, but not understanding itself
Breaking down the idea is undoubtedly valuable because it gets to the root of the problem of understanding: it is not the length of the distance our mind has to travel that challenges us. Rather, it is the question of what the first ste…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the vast insect collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., one small box of beetles stands out from countless others. Currently it sits on the desk of Floyd Shockley, the museum’s entomology collections manager. He’s spent his spare summer hours in 2023 meticulously working on the contents of this box—re-placing rhinestones and replica rubies. The box contains 28 maquech beetles: bedazzled bugs once meant to be worn as living jewelry.

“I can’t say for sure, but I’d wager this is one of the best and most well-rounded collections in terms of different decorative styles of maquechs,” he says.

Maquech, or makech, beetles are objects of legend, and also tourist trinkets and sources of concern for both border control and conservationists. Sold al…]]></summary>

Penney,” and you’ll likely be met with a description of big box stores in dying shopping malls of various cities and suburbs. And yet, this retail giant actually got its start in the remote rural town of Kemmerer, Wyoming, where its “Mother Store” still exists today.

James Cash Penney, Jr. was born outside Hamilton, Missouri, in 1875. After moving west in hopes that the weather would be good for his health, he ended up working for Thomas Callahan and Guy Johnson, who owned the Golden Rule dry goods store chain operating throughout Colorado and Wyoming. In 1902, Callahan and Johnson gave Penney seed money to open a store in Ogden, Utah. Believing that market to be too large, Penney suggested Kemmerer as an a…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-09-07T16:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Otaru was known for its herring fisheries during the last half of the 19th century. Its golden year was 1897, when it scored a record total of a near-million ton of herrings—accounting for six-tenths of that year's national catch.

Like a gold rush, the abundance of fish attracted opportunity-seekers and drove them out to sea. Collectively referred to as yan-shū in the north, these fishermen were known for their rough nature and their sea shanty called Sōran Bushi, which continues to be remembered as one of Japan's most iconic folk songs.

In Otaru, the yan-shū lodged in dormitories at massive mansions called Nishin-Goten. Built by the nouveau riche who had made their fortunes from huge catches of herrings, these wooden "herring palaces" typically stood on the hilltop by the seaside so that any shoal of herrings was not missed.

Few herring palaces have survived over the years, but few of those standing today are herring palaces, technically speaking. A majority of them are either banya, smaller-scale lodges for the herring fishermen, or villas built by the fishery bosses for themselves.

Standing on a hilltop along the Ishikari Bay coastline is the Otaru Herring Palace, the "real" Nishin-Goten completed in 1897. Initially built in Shakotan, it was moved to its current location in 1958 and is now managed by the Otaru Aquarium as a historic monument and museum.

On display are mainly fishermen’s equipment and old photographs, as well as scenes from Otaru’s fishery past re-enacted by dolls and in dioramas. Still, the main exhibit is the building itself. The lodging area, the spacious hall, and the wooden beams, all hearken back to the heyday of Otaru's herring era. Visitors can also feel the past in fishermen's clothes that can be worn for free.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As travelers cross the Kansas-Oklahoma border while heading north on Highway 81, they may happen upon a seemingly unsettling sight near Caldwell, Kansas. In the distance, a caravan of riders is traveling alongside you, driving cattle. These silhouetted figures are known as the "Ghost Riders of the Chisholm Trail."

The Abilene stockyards opened in 1866, providing a new, safer, and shorter route for Texas ranchers to deliver their goods to the north and east. They began to use an old hunting and trading route through indigenous territory, that had been scouted by Jesse Chisholm, a Cherokee merchant, and his friend Black Beaver, a Lenape guide and trader. The trail, which became known as the Chisholm Trail, runs through what is now Highway 81. As the railroad grew, the trail changed shape, eventually ending at Caldwell, before being overtaken by newer, better routes.

In 1995, a group of volunteers worked together to memorialize this era in silhouetted steel. The trail is best viewed at dawn, as the sun breaks over the trail, or at dusk, as the trail figures seemingly come to life as they face the waning light.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had conversations with Nora Eisner (Flatiron) and Abby Shaum (CUNY) today about how we report the significance of a signal we find in a time series. In particular a periodic signal. It's an old, unsolved problem, with a lot of literature. And various hacks that are popular in the exoplanet community (and binary-star community!). My position is very simple: Since all methods for determining significance are flawed, and since when you fit a signal you have to estimate also an uncertainty on that signal's parameters, the simplest and most basic test of significance is the significance with which you measure the  of the proposed signal. That is, if the amplitude is well measured, the signal is real. Of course there are adversarial data sets I can make where this isn't true! But that's just a restatement of the point that this is an unsolved problem. For deep reasons!amplitude]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asakusa is one of Tokyo’s most popular tourist destinations, known for the iconic Sensō-ji Temple complex and a network of quaint shopping streets leading up to it. Historically, it was also the center of pre-war cultural modernization, home to many of Japan’s firsts, such as the bar, cinema, amusement park and more.

Underneath this bustling district, only a staircase away from the throng of tourists, hides the oldest surviving subterranean shopping street in Japan: the Asakusa Underground Street.

Established in 1955, the Underground Street is connected to the Asakusa metro station, which itself is part of the oldest subway in Asia. From the ground level, on the other hand, the entrances to the Underground Street are rather inconspicuous and hardly noticeable unless you know where to f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s no secret that Mississippi is currently America’s poorest state, but that doesn’t mean local residents are just sitting around waiting for their cities to crumble. As downtown Yazoo City struggled with rising vacancy rates and a difficult business environment, local business owners on Main Street banded together and began to fight back with a bold strategy: cans of brightly colored pastel paint.

Most of the downtown buildings in Yazoo City date back to the same year: 1904. That was the year a fire ripped through Yazoo City, burning down most of the buildings and forcing it to rebuild. A local legend claims this was the work of “The Witch of Yazoo,” who cursed the town after drowning in quicksand. Others may claim poor fire codes.

These historic buildings fell into a general state of disrepair until the early 2000s, when members of the Yazoo County CVB convinced remaining business owners to paint downtown in various vibrant colors designed to give the town a Caribbean look, or maybe that of a gaudier version of Charleston’s Rainbow Row. 

The block is anchored by the historic Main Street Hotel, and its event space, “The No Smoking Smoke House.” From November through early January, Christmas lights are hung on the buildings, lending the town an even more vibrant and colorful pageantry. Main Street still has its share of vacant storefronts, but the town has seen a revival both from the renewed vigor of town, and from tourists attracted by its photogenic exterior.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1960s, Italy was crossed by an economic boom. The paper businessman Luigi Burgo wanted a new factory to host a new, huge, paper machine. The factory needed to be able to expand as business increased. This was a great problem, he needed a 250-meter-long room with a 160-meter-long wall without a pillar (to allow the possible expansion).

Burgo called Pier Luigi Nervi to solve the problem. Nervi was an Italian architect who specialized in the Brutalist style. At that time he already built many stadiums, bridges, spot halls and the UNESCO headquarters in Italy. Nervi was in love with the architectural potential of enforced concrete and was already known as the "poet" or the "tailor" of enforced concrete.

Nervi decided to approach the challenge in a completely different way, building a bridge-like structure instead of a normal factory building. He built two sets of piers to hold up metal chains that allow the ceiling to "float" over the structure without pillars, but with walls made only of metal and glass.

Burgo's new paper mill became an iconic structure. It was in use until 2013 when the all company shut down due to low newspaper sales. The factory was used again starting in 2015 after it was taken over by another company.]]></summary>

Maharaja Duleep Singh was born in Lahore, in modern-day Pakistan, on September 6, 1838. His father Ranjit Singh was the first Sikh Maharaja of the Punjab and Sikh Empire, in modern-day eastern Pakistan and northwestern India. After his father’s death, a series of successors were killed. Finally, Duleep Singh was declared Maharaja at just five years old.

The British, through their agents in the East India Company, were quick to exploit the unstable situation in the Punjab and after two Anglo-Sikh wars, the Company took control of the region. The Maharaja, just 10 years old at the time, was forced to sign…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Buddhist temple of Ryūkōin was once in possession of a peculiar statue called Kateki. Also honorifically referred to as Kateki-Sonja or Kateki-Sama, it was believed to represent an ancient Chinese polymath, the inventor of sailing vessels who had lived during the reign of the Yellow Emperor.

The wooden statue became a boogeyman at some point, used by mothers to scare their children into good behavior. According to local legend, Kateki was actually the Adzuki-Baba, an old hag characterized by an eerie bean-grinding noise. It was said that Kateki would transform into a badger at night and carry off naughty children into the dark, presumably to feast on them. Children were unimpressed by the stories, however; it is said that they would come barging into the temple and use the statue as a mere plaything.

It was not until 1924 that the true identity of the Kateki statue was finally revealed. It was photographed and introduced to the world at the Vatican expo, garnering attention from historians, who recognized its Erasmian attributes. It was, in fact, a statue of the Dutch theologian and philosopher Desiderius Erasmus—but its historic value was simply underestimated.

As it turned out, the Erasmus statue had once served as the stern figurehead of the De Liefde, originally named the Erasmus, an East Indiaman that set sail from Rotterdam in 1598. Winding up ashore in Bungo Province (today Oita Prefecture), the ship brought some of the first Europeans to reach Japan, including Jan Joosten and William Adams. She was wrecked and lost in time, leaving only the Erasmus statue to survive and somehow end up at Ryūkōin Temple.

When news broke, the Netherlands offered to purchase the statue, but the Japanese government declined and designated it as a National Treasure. While the temple retains ownership over it, it has been loaned to the Tokyo National Museum, where it goes on display from time to time. A replica of it is permanently exhibited at the Sano City Museum, as well as at the Maritime Museum in Rotterdam.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When settlers first reached the Wyoming Territory, they would often use natural features as lines of demarcation. In what would one day become Campbell County, the first settlers used a rockpile to stake their claim on the land. This settlement became known as Rocky Pile, but when the Burlington & Missouri Railroad arrived in 1891, the town was renamed Gillette after one of their surveyors.

The rockpile continued to be a sedimentary symbol of the town’s fortunes, visible from Highway 16 as Gillette grew and became a mining mecca. Residents were torn between leveling the ground for its continued development and preserving it as part of the town’s legacy. Finally, in 1970, Ralph A. Kintz bought the land and donated it to Campbell County. Four years later, the Campbell County Rockpile Museum opened.

In addition to preserving the rockpile, the museum interprets the history of the Powder River Basin. It contains exhibits on paleontology and geology, as well as firearms, saddles, and spurs from the town’s ranching and cowboy days. Particular interest is paid to Gillette’s heritage of coal mining. At its peak, the Powder River basin provided more than 35 percent of the energy for the entire nation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Constructed in 1850, this 72-foot-long, Ithiel Town wooden lattice truss bridge is one of the last two that remain among the 13 that once crisscrossed Red Clay Creek in Delaware.

The Wilmington and Western Railroad once included a station near the bridge and the area became a very popular picnic spot for train passengers. The railroad still runs alongside Red Clay Creek and carries riders past Wooddale Bridge to this day.

Wooddale grew to become a village in the 1890s, but it survived for less than 20 years with people moving away after the last factory, a paper mill, burned down in 1918.

In 2003, the original Wooddale Bridge was destroyed by flooding related to Tropical Storm Henri. Between 2007-2008, the Delaware Department of Transportation undertook a multimillion-dollar effort to restore the bridge. This included raising the roadway five feet and using highly durable Bongossi wood to better fortify the span.

The bridge was re-opened on December 15, 2008, and has been standing strong ever since.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1953, a shoe salesman named Albert J. King, still mourning the loss of his nephew, John Cooper, during World War II, had a proposal for the city of Emporia, Kansas. Why not adapt Armistice Day, a holiday established to honor World War I veterans, into a holiday for all veterans? Through that idea, Veterans Day came to Emporia, and soon after to the entire United States as well.

Emporia first celebrated Veterans Day on November 11, 1953. The next year, U.S. Representative Ed Rees, also from Emporia, brought a bill to Congress changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day. U.S. President and fellow Kansan Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954, and the first national Veterans Day was celebrated later that year.

As with much history, this narrative is somewhat complicated by reality. In particular, Birmingham, Alabama, also has a strong claim on Veterans Day, due to the efforts of World War II veteran Raymond Weeks to establish a Veterans Day in 1947. To share credit, Birmingham was named the “first city of Veterans Day” by the Senate, while Emporia was proclaimed the “Founding City of Veterans Day” by the House. Veterans Day, much like success, has many fathers.

On May 26, 1991,  to cement Emporia’s legacy as the home of Veterans Day, a park was opened to honor U.S. veterans of all wars. Displays at the memorial include a World War II M-4A6 Sherman army tank, and a Huey helicopter from the Vietnam War. Tablets of Honor recognize individual veterans through donated plaques. Each year in November, the town observes All Veterans Tribute Week in recognition of all veterans and Emporia's history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Namdaemun is one of eight gates built into the Fortress Wall, a Joseon Dynasty fortification that surrounded and protected the city of Seoul.

Namdaemun (남대문) means "South Great Door" but the gate is officially known as Sungnyemun (숭례문) "Honouring Propriety Door."An interesting side note is that it is a common but false belief among many Koreans that the name Namdaemun was imposed by the Japanese, and therefore many feel that it should not be used.  The truth is that Joseon dynasty records show naming gates after their respective direction was actually in use before the Japanese invaded. 

The gate dates back to the 14th century, and is constructed in a historic pagoda-style gateway design. It was first built at the end of King Taejo's reign, in 1398, and was then rebuilt in 1447.

While he strolled along his quiet, residential neighborhood at the edge of the city center, a green door of a Victorian building caught his eye.

The door was grubby, graffitied, and clearly very old, likely built sometime (like so much of Edinburgh) in the early 19th century. “But what was this door’s story?” Mogg wondered. What kind of lives might it have witnessed?

Right there, in front of the eye-catching doorway, Mogg searched the address in the British Newspaper Archive on his phone. Within seconds, he was skimming through stories of past residents. In 1888, a window cleaner had fallen off the building and died. In 1896, a resident died of gangrene after a heavy…]]></summary>

Overlooking a snaking waterway of tangled emerald mangroves and silver-flanked snapper stood a lone interpretive sign. It featured a drawing of a courageous Black man wearing a tricornered hat and looking wistfully toward the horizon.

“Many legends talk of a pirate named ‘Black Caesar,’ who was reputed to have stalked the water and keys of Biscayne Bay during the 1700s,” the sign states. “Some of these stories claim that Black Caesar left tons of silver somewhere in what is now Biscayne National Park.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australians are not known for building grand family mausoleums or enormous burial monuments that are often found in other countries. Rather it is far more common for people to have a stone, sometimes on older graves an obelisk or an angel, or perhaps to have the grave paved over with tile and an iron fence (although most of the iron fences were removed long ago, for a variety of reasons). These days, most modern cemeteries simply encourage the use of a metal plaque on a concrete block to facilitate mowing the lawns. But this building is something else. It is large, topped with an urn made of concrete, and with walls of stained glass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Entering Cut Bank, Montana, it's hard to miss the sign announcing that you've entered the coldest town in America. Because that sign takes the form of a giant concrete penguin.

The big bird was created by Cut Bank resident Ron Gustafson more than 30 years ago. "It was on one of those flash-frozen days, February 1, 1989," according to Roadside America, "when the wind chill plummeted to 64 degrees below zero" and Gustafson decided he should commemorate the town's claim to fame. The 27-foot-tall penguin stood outside of his family's appliance store.

The base of the statue proclaims Cut Bank "the coldest spot in the nation," but is that actually true? In the winter, the temperature rarely gets above freezing. The coldest temperature in the town's history was -47 degrees Fahrenheit, which happened on February 15, 1936. (The record for lowest temperature in the United States comes from Prospect Creek, Alaska, which hit -80 degrees Fahrenheit on January 23, 1971.)]]></summary>

As with most great works of art, “Home on the Range” was originally drafted by an otolaryngologist. Dr. Brewster M. Higley VI had moved from Indiana to a cabin on the banks of West Beaver Creek. Inspired by the natural beauty of his new surroundings, he wrote a poem he titled “My Western Home.” While Dr. Higley was operating on a man with a gunshot wound, a friend of the patient read the poem and said he should publish it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s widely known that Walt Disney had a secret apartment on the second floor of Disneyland Fire Department, which overlooks the entire park. It was his favorite spot, and he would light the lamp by the window whenever he came up here, signaling to cast members that the man himself was at work.

Curiously, it is said that the lamp kept turning itself on after Walt's death in 1966, which developed into an urban legend before long. Some believe that it contains his spirit and that he is always watching the guests enjoy his masterpiece that will never be completed, an ever-growing kingdom of dreams.

Though a variant of the legend claims that the lamp has never been turned off since the supernatural incident, it is not quite true, of course, and avid park-goers and Disney historians have noted that the current lamp, as well as the one before it, is a replacement and not the original Walt Disney lamp. Casual guests, on the other hand, may not even know how significant this fire department building is in the first place.

The legendary apartment is not open to the public, and you can only see the lamp from ground level. On special occasions, however, Disneyland Park offers guided tours which include a visit to the upper apartment, a rare opportunity to meet Walt Disney's ghost face to face.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The subtleties of women have long baffled men. Take anthropologist William Webb. In the 1940s, he was briefly perplexed to find hunting tools in the ancient graves of women. Webb, then head of the department of archaeology and anthropology at the University of Kentucky, was investigating the Indian Knoll site, from the Late Archaic Period (5,000 to 3,000 years ago). He concluded that the hunting gear—in this case an atlatl, or spear-thrower—must have been placed there by husbands, or because they made pretty hair ornaments.

“It is hardly to be supposed that ... women would have any practical use in life for an atlatl … such occurrences represent true burial offerings to the dead of artifacts primarily intended for the use of men,” Webb wrote in 1946.

"Three halls," he says in a modest way. Once inside you'll turn around and realize your head contains too few eyes to absorb the place in one look. It's beautifully stuffed, arranged by themes and one can see how many years of collecting have gone into this. Past these three halls, the museum expands outside when you go around the corner only to let your jaw drop once again by realizing the museum doubles or even triples size here, just as packed with finds and treasures by Manuel as all the other halls.

Open since 1977, the Musée chez Manuel displays all the finds of this tireless traveler-collector in over 2,000 square meters of exhibition space. Manuel Ribeiro, founder of the museum: “I crossed France as a traveling salesman. One day a farmer gave me a trolley lamp. And I caught the collecting virus.”

On the flyer of the museum (also called Musee d'Art Populaire) it says it shows automobiles, bicycles, motorcycles, pedal cars, old toys and unusual objects. That last term fits best, for this museum is filled with passion and dedication, leaning towards obsession in the best way possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Souto da Retorta, also known as the Chavín Eucalyptus Forest, near the town of Viveiro in Galicia, there are some of the tallest eucalyptus trees on the continent. The largest and most outstanding among them is O Avó ("grandfather" in Galician). A tree of the species Eucalyptus globulus was planted here in 1880 in order to drain the lowlands flooded by the streams of the river Landro.

The eucalyptus arrived in Europe in the 19th century, specifically in northwestern Spain, when a Galician priest brought its seeds from the distant Australian lands where he had been a missionary.  Optimally adapted to the conditions of the humid oceanic climate and spread massively throughout northern Spain where, due to its rapid growth, it has been cultivated to obtain wood and paper.

These eucalyptus plants were the first planted here, and O Avó is the oldest of them, being the biggest tree in Spain, standing more than 67 meters (220 feet) tall.  (There is controversy due to the height of one of the eucalyptus trees that surround it with which it has a close height of a few feet difference) Furthermore it would be the tallest eucalyptus in Europe. 

A perimeter fence has been installed to protect O Avó, since due to its age, it is affected by various diseases and also to avoid compaction of the ground in its surroundings that could affect its growth.

In 2010, O Avó was elected Tree of the Year by Bosques sin Fronteras (Forests Without Borders).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kitaichi Glass is one of the most popular brands based in Otaru, established in 1901 as a manufacturer of petrol lamps and trawler floats. As Otaru developed into a major tourist destination over the years, it shifted to producing tableware, ornaments, wind chimes, and the like, branching into a total of 17 locations within the city.

On the bustling Sakaimachi-Dori shopping street stands the Sangokan ("Building No. 3"), a historic building constructed in 1891 as a fishery warehouse where local herrings were processed and canned. Trolley tracks from those bygone days, which connected the warehouse to the harbor, are also well preserved, allowing visitors to walk over as an atmospheric corridor.

Today, the former warehouse is home to an outlet of Kitaichi Glass, three floors full of stunning glassware, as well as a café called the Kitaichi Hall.

Simply put, the Kitaichi Hall is nothing short of magnificence, with a lofty ceiling and wooden beams. Its only source of lighting is 167 petroleum lamps, a few on each table and some on the chandeliers above, giving a warm, nostalgic, dreamlike feel to the place. Along the wall sits a Steinway grand piano, where live performances are held daily from Tuesday to Friday (except national holidays) at 2:00, 3:00, and 4:00 PM.

Full of local fare, the menu is well worth a mention, of course. The whipped ice cream and royal milk tea are made from the famous Hokkaido milk, and the parfait is made from haskap, the blue honeysuckle native to Hokkaido. During the lunch hours between 11:00 AM and 2:50 PM, you can also order rice bowls and noodles featuring Hokkaido's signature seafood: crab, salmon, and salmon roe. There's a nice selection of Otaru's craft beer, too.

The petroleum lamps are lit by human hands every morning at 8:45, allowing early visitors to watch the operation before opening for the day at 9:00.]]></summary>

His father, Eloy Alfaro, who founded the factory in 1923 in Sarchí, Costa Rica, asked his son which craft he wanted to learn to help construct the carts. Out of woodworking, blacksmithing, and mechanics, the young Castro chose mechanics—and 70 years later, he is still diligently constructing oxcarts in the tiny town of Sarchí, masterfully crafting each part by hand with the help of his associates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep in a wooded area near the University town of Lampeter, West Wales is an outdoor theatre. Around it, hidden in the woodland are figures of angels and wood spirits carved from the trees. In front of the stage are tiered seats that have been fashioned from the hilly natural slope of the wood.

To the right of the slowly decaying stage next to a poem written in the Welsh language is a poem by Dylan Thomas, Wales's most famous poet. His poem 'Do not go gentle into that good night' was written by Thomas in the knowledge of the death of his father. This is perhaps a fitting tribute to the theatre itself. Parts of the wooden stage have collapsed and other areas are beginning to rot away. It appears to have been some time since a performance was staged at this magical location.

Longwood Woodland Theatre started out as part of a community initiative in 2003. An area of woodland was purchased and run as a social enterprise. It became Wales's first sustainable community woodland. Built as a zero-carbon project, it was constructed using timber from the local forest without cement or concrete. Two hundred volunteers took part in the enterprise from local rural communities where social exclusion can be a challenge to young people. One of the aims of the project was to restore non-native plantations to native broadleaf species. Since 2007, 10,000 trees have been planted.

There is limited information concerning how many plays or musicals were staged at the theatre, but it may have fallen into disuse during the Covid pandemic in 2020 where social distancing laws prevented any outdoor gatherings from taking place. Nature has now started to reclaim these spaces. Songs and performances are now only by birds such as Goldcrest and the rare Wood Warblers that nest here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On a bench in the center of Yoshkar-Ola, the capital of the Mari El Republic, sits a bronze sculpture of a smug-faced cat with a newspaper spread under his butt. This is the Yoshkin Cat, a visual representation of a Russian expletive.

In Russian, yoshkin-kot (literally “Yoshkin cat”) is a humorous phrase uttered in surprise or mild shock, perhaps similar to the “holy cow” in English. One theory suggests that it may refer to Bayun, a magical cat in Russian fairytales, who often assists the witch Baba Yaga.

However, it is not known what yoshkin (or sometimes ezhkin) really means anymore—perhaps a corruption of some earlier word. But one thing is thought to be clear: that it has nothing to do with Yoshkar-Ola, despite the similarity of the sounds.

Still, the Cat of Yoshkar-Ola keeps on smirking smugly, regardless of his relevance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the early 20th century, Sir Hubert Miller was the Lord of the Manor in the picturesque Hampshire village of Froyle. The Miller family had been a prominent presence in the community for over a century, funding church repairs and the construction of a village school.

Miller was a man of deep faith and often traveled to his villa in Venice, Italy. During his travels, he acquired an impressive collection of religious icons and saintly statues, which he brought back to Froyle and installed in the village's church. Over time, his collection grew larger, and he began placing these beautiful sculptures around the village too, adorning Upper Froyle with 19 unique and highly detailed figures.

Thanks to Miller's passion for collecting, Froyle was christened "The Village of Saints." To this day, the thatched cottages and redbrick houses of Upper Froyle continue to display these fantastic figures. One of the most charming homes in Froyle is Post Office Cottage, which features a statue of Saint Hubert, the patron saint of hunting, for whom Sir Hubert is the namesake.

Whether you're a history buff, a lover of art, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of charming villages, Froyle and its fascinating collection of saints are sure to capture your heart.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Housed within the collections of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Missouri's Museum Support Center is a peculiar artifact, and one of the newest in comparison with the other 2 million artifacts in the museum's collections. A 1975 Ford Econoline van named Ghost Dancing sits idle, decades after taking the journey recounted in the book Blue Highways: A Journey into America. 

The van was named after the Ghost Dance, first practiced by the Nevada Northern Paiute tribe as a way to ward off American Western Expansion. Author William Trogden published Blue Highways under the name William Least-Heat Moon, harkening to his father's indigenous roots that he used as a guiding principle for his journey.

William Least-Heat Moon got divorced, lost his job as a professor at Stephen's College in Columbia, and in 1978 set off on a three-month journey in a circle around the United States to connect with people in small towns such as Why, Arizona, and Whynot, Mississippi. Decades before the #VanLife trend, Least-Heat Moon lived in Ghost Dancing, following the 'blue highways' on his Rand McNally atlas to direct him toward the paths less traveled. 

"When you're traveling, you are what you are right there and then," he wrote. "People don't have your past to hold against you. No yesterdays on the road.” 

In the Museum Support Center's collections, you can also visit the Grayson Archery Collection—the world's most extensive collection of historical bows and arrows. From six continents, the Grayson collection catalogs the history of archery through indigenous history, various types of mechanical advancements through the ages, and world record-holding bows.]]></summary>

Bangalore is a mid-sized city that saw a very big expansion in the past few years due to having become a center for the information technology in the country - with most of the big multinationals opening sections there. The rapid expansion increased the wealth of the middle class there (but remember, the middle class is the top 5% in India), but it also created stress to the traffic in the city, which is notoriously a plague there.The campus of ICTS is very nice from an architectonic point of view, embedding nature in its buildings and trying to integrate the two realities.

The unit vectors have gradients because, in a curvilinear coordinate system, they have orientations that depend on position.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can take a warp pipe back to your childhood in Fargo, North Dakota, where two artists have collaborated on a mural of one of the most famous scenes in video game history. The artists call this interactive art project the "Fargo Mario Wall," while others may consider it Instagram bait for elder millennials.

Although now a popular tourist attraction, the "Fargo Mario Wall" began life as a semi-guerrilla street art project by an artist couple who went by the handles “Dark Elvis” and “Icky Hiccup.” After an earlier mural project was covered up, the artists were convinced that they had to find a wall for their idea for a mural based upon World 1-1 in Super Mario Bros., and they connected with a Fargo-based community building organization, Folkways to complete the mural in 2018.

The mural consists of the beginning scene of World 1-1, where Mario encounters his first enemy, the Goomba, perhaps the single most-defeated enemy in video game history. Mario is missing from the work, to allow passersby to complete the image themselves. The interactive display allows visitors to choose to either stomp the Goomba, raise their fists to hit the power-up for a mushroom, or both.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally established in 598 CE, the Raiden Shrine in the Gunma town of Itakura is known as Japan’s main center of thunder worship, and for centuries, people have prayed to the gods of thunder here for protection from natural disasters.

While the shrine itself is an impressive sight, with the current building dating back to 1835, it is also home to a hidden gem lying in an annex building just across the road.

Namazu-San is a sleek brass sculpture of a catfish with a slight smile, comfortably placed on a long cushion. Guarding him is a group of red demons representing thunder. In Japanese folklore, the giant subterrestrial catfish is considered to be the cause of earthquakes, often subdued by another god of thunder. Since the Middle Ages, this association has been common knowledge and reflected everywhere in Japanese culture, from traffic signs to Pokémon.

The brazen catfish of Raiden Shrine is not only worshipped for protection against earthquakes, but also for his confidence-boosting mojo. The unattended shrine lets visitors take a handkerchief for a donation of 300 yen and wipe Namazu-San with it, rubbing off his charm so that they can take it home for good luck.

The unusual belief and practice derive from a simple wordplay, something Japanese culture traditionally appreciates. To put it simply, “earthquake” and “confidence” are homophonous in Japanese, written as 地震 and 自信 respectively but both read jishin.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Half a mile east of Rosehearty, a ruined castle sits on the slopes of a hill overlooking a sandy bay. Pitsligo Castle was originally designed as a keep dating to 1424. It was then modified in the 1570s by the Forbes of Druminnor. Despite not having a particularly strong or strategically important location, Pitsligo Castle overlooked the shipping route along the Moray Firth coast.

Scottish historian W. Douglas Simpson described Pitsligo Castle as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, a term used to refer to the rocky headland of northeast Aberdeenshire.

The castle has an arched gateway in the outer courtyard's west wall, which is marked both with the date 1656 and the coats of arms of both the Forbes and the Eskine families. In the inner court, however, the date is shown as 1663. Several armorial plaques can be found on other inner walls, including the Pitsligo Arms of 1665 and the Royal Arms dated 1577 and 1603.

There is a tall flanking drum tower in the northeast corner of the courtyard. Pitsligo Castle's main tower had three vaulted stories, but since its abandonment nearly everything above the lowest level has disappeared.

The Forbes family made the mistake of supporting the Jacobite cause, and in 1745 their estate forfeited to the crown. Flemish troops led by William Lascelles, looted and destroyed Pitsligo Castle in 1845. Eventually, the roof was removed and the castle fell into ruin.

At some point, it appears that restoration work was begun on the castle. Some of the fallen masonry has been collected into large piles of rubble that litter the inner courtyard. Work currently appears halted.]]></summary>

As a child, he would help his parents, Frank and Minnie, manage their 160-acre farm. However, by the time Walter was 13, his parents had to sell the farm due to ongoing drought, and Walter moved into Humboldt, where he attended school. 

Walter Johnson moved with his family to Southern California in 1902, where he began to pick up the game of baseball. An athletic child, he picked the game up quickly, becoming something of a phenom who began to garner attention, first from local and regional semipro teams, and eventually, by 1907, the Washington Senators.

“Truly thou art damned: like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.”

William Shakespeare’s witty fool Touchstone lets this zinger fly in As You Like It, and the food historian senses a challenge. The art of egg-roasting may now be as bygone as an eglantine or a bodkin, but what can be learned of the history and fate of the technique? Furthermore, in defining for us an ill-roasted egg, Touchstone not only proposes a history question, but presents a cooking challenge—to well-roast an egg, evenly, and to taste.

Located on Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock, the Baba & Nyonya Heritage Museum is housed in a preserved two-story Peranakan mansion built in 1861 for the wealthy Chan family. Since its public opening in March 1985, it has been run by their descendants and showcases the lavish lifestyle of the Baba-Nyonya in their heyday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A 22-meter cast iron statue known as la Fuente Pública (the Public Fountain) was created in 1984 by the Valencian architect Miquel Navarro, commissioned by Aguas Potables for 5 million pesetas. It was built to commemorate water entering the city through the Turia-Júcar Canal from the Júcar River.

Because of its resemblance to the Pink Panther, a beloved cartoon character that debuted in the 1960s, the fountain is known as "La Pantera Rosa." It changed color from its original pinkish red to pink, only to be painted back to its original red hue.

Having led to criticisms for its controversial look and placement in the city, it is a must-visit for its rather strange connection to the cartoon character. Many locals can agree that it looks rather odd, leading to the idea behind its creation often being missed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you know one thing about 12th-century Arab cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, it is that he is the author of this wonky world map, which is often included in modern atlases as a prime example of medieval mapmaking skills.

That invites comparisons that do him no favors. Among the hyper-precise maps in today’s atlases, al-Idrisi’s looks like a child’s drawing. His Europe is sketchy, his Asia amorphous, and his Africa manages to be both partial and oversized. Plus, the map is a planisphere—the projection of a sphere onto a flat (and typically circular) plane—which creates the mistaken impression that al-Idrisi was a flat-Earther of the Discworld variety.


And that’s not all that’s wrong with this map. For starters, you’re seeing it upside-down. As did most Arab maps of that time, this o…]]></summary>

Kim Dae-Seong, a Prime Minister of the Silla Dynasty initiated and supervised the construction of both a temple and a grotto at Mount Toham. It is said that he had the temple built in memory of his parents in his present life, and the grotto in memory of his parents from a previous life.

Work was completed on the grotto in 774, shortly after Kim's death. Due to the small size of the grotto it is thought that it was probably used exclusively by the Silla royalty who took over its construction after Kim passed away.

The tradition of carving images of Buddha from stone into cliff walls and natural caves began in India. …]]></summary>

The Republic of Cows

by Jude Isabella, Hakai Magazine

Chirikof, a remote island off the coast of Alaska, is about the size of two Manhattans—and home to more than 2,000 cows. Depending on whom you ask, writes Jude Isabella, the cattle are either unwelcome invasive megafauna or rightful heirs of a place they have inhabited for at least 200 years. Whether they stay or go will probably come down to human emotion, rather than historical or ecological evidence.

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/beginning-end-historic-route-66-chicago"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The “Mother Road” that helped define America’s love affair with the road trip is now decommissioned, but key parts of historic U.S. Highway 66 remain, and aficionados still trace the route from its origin near the shore of Lake Michigan in Chicago to its unofficial terminus in Santa Monica, California. And though it’s always been understood as a journey heading west, it does go both ways, both beginning and ending in Chicago on the Midwest Coast.

U.S. Highway 66 was officially created by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads in 1926 as one of the highways that would make up the network of America’s first Federal highway interstate system. The new system redesignated existing roads in many areas to piece together a coordinated interstate system.

According to the Route 66 Association of Illinois, Route 66 began in Chicago in 1926 at the intersection of Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue. This initial portion of the highway was renamed Illinois State 4, which ran from Chicago to East St. Louis. With this pre-existing state highway, the Illinois portion of Route 66 was the first to be completely paved and was also the first to replace the existing road with the U.S. highway. In the mid-1950s, the starting point of Route 66 was moved over a block due to a change in Chicago traffic patterns that made Jackson Drive a one-way street.

Today, Historic Route 66 begins in front of the Art Institute of Chicago, with a sign on the south side of the street that is almost completely covered in stickers. It ends where it originally began at East Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue with a sign on Jackson Boulevard that is less covered in stickers and much more easily identifiable.

As exemplified in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, the route is about more than transportation, it’s about people, their stories, and our collective history.]]></summary>

This unassuming grave has become a beacon of hope, drawing hundreds of pilgrims each week, all in search of the miraculous healing powers believed to emanate from the rainwater collected on its surface.

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/edins-hall-broch-scotland"/>
        <updated>2023-09-01T16:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A broch is a uniquely Scottish Iron Age form of roundhouse fortification usually found in the northern part of the country. There are over 500 brochs in Scotland, mostly distributed between northern and western Scotland and the islands, with only a small handful in the Scottish Lowlands. Edin's Hall Broch sits as part of a very unusual complex.

The hill fort that surrounds the broch predates the broch by about 2,000 to 2,500 years. The broch itself is thought to date back to some time between 0-200 A.D. It has double ramparts which enclose an oval area measuring 135 meters by 75 meters. The ramparts are impressive, in places standing up to 4.5 meters in height.

Towards the center of the fort are the remains of a large roundhouse, which would likely have been the most important building in the enclosure prior to the construction of the broch.

The broch stands tucked away in one corner of the hill fort, within an oval enclosure of 58 meters by 54 meters that separates it from the rest of the site. What remains of the thick stone wall hints at its impressive size. A narrow entrance passageway to the west side would have been guarded by two chambers set back in the wall on either side of the doorway.

The walls themselves also held chambers, three of them in almost dumbbell shape. They were sturdy enough to support staircases that rose up between the walls to provide access to the wallhead.

What makes Edin's Hall so unusual is its massive size. At 28 meters in diameter to the outer wall, it stands much larger than most Highland broch. Some have suggested that it would not have stood as tall as other brochs because of its diameter, but there is evidence that the walls originally stood to twice their current height at around two meters.  There are also suggestions that it possibly was not covered in the same way as other brochs, making it more like a substantial Iron Age roundhouse than a traditional broch.]]></summary>

The founder of a successful bank and a longtime resident of Florence, Artusi was a wealthy bachelor who devoted his retirement to his interests. These included analyzing poetry, attending university lectures, and collecting recipes to be tested by his household cook and Sabatini, his housekeeper (Artusi was menu-planner and taster, but did little cooking himself).

Friends encouraged Artusi to publish his recipe collection. In 1891, when he was 71 years old, Artusi collected his recipes into a book, Scienza in cucina e l’arte di mangiar bene (Science in the Kitchen and …]]></summary>

In 1940-1941, there were a number of modifications and alterations done to the building, including a new roof and updated iron-clad cells.

The jail was closed by Governor Lester Maddox and was eventually auctioned off to the Liberty County Housing Authority. After that, the building was donated to the city of Hinesville, where they have been holding exhibits for local artists.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This area of the Insurgentes Mixcoac colonia (neighborhood) of Mexico City, could well be called "Little Spain." Not necessarily because of a large migrant community from the European country, but rather just because of its street names. Málaga, Santander, Cádiz, and others can be found here, although Seville does not get a street and is instead the namesake of the Plaza Sevilla, a small roundabout with a peculiar monument at its center.

The Fuente de Sevilla (Seville Fountain) was built here in the 1920s, with a design from architect Leonardo Noriega and engineer Javier Stávoli. Noriega and Stávoli are probably best known for the Parque México, one of the city's main parks. Parque México is located in the Condesa colonia, noted for its Art Deco and Art Nouveau architecture, dating to the 1920s and 30s.

Plaza Sevilla's fountain follows the same trends, with an almost pyramidal geometric design, decorated with undulating corners and stained glass on all four sides. Near the top, paintings of the Sun and Moon complete the design. The fountain basin is carved in stone, and the designers' names are found on a plaque here.

By the 1970s, the fountain stood forgotten, and for almost 50 years it was vandalized and deteriorated (even losing an original clock). Its renovation was finished in 2020, and since then, it has stood as a small yet significant century-old heritage.]]></summary>

It's here that the Ganges River comes down from the foothills of the Himalayas and enters the plains of eastern India. At this auspicious location, Hindu pilgrims come to bathe in the river and give offerings. Ceremonies and festivals often take place here as well.

Every evening the Ganga Aarti ceremony can be seen at sunset where a fire offering is made to the river goddess,  the Goddess Ganga or Maa Ganga. Various Hindu festivals often take place here, the largest of which is the Kumbh Mela. Every 12 years thousands of pilgrims descend on Haridwar for the Kumbh Mela and crowd into Har Ki Pauri. The next Haridwar Kumbh Mela will take place in 2033.]]></summary>

In this episode of The Atlas Obscura Podcast, we transports listeners to the gorgeous coastal waters of Maine as we set sail aboard the Lewis R. French—the oldest commercial sailing vessel in the US and a National Historic Landmark.

Join host Dylan Thuras as he learns about windjammers from Captain Becky Wright, who just took the helm of the Lewis R. French in 2022. Originally built as a freight schooner and launched in April, 1871, the Lewis R. French was rebuilt for the passenger trade in the 1970s and has had a second life taking travelers on multi day adventures up and down the coast of Maine.

We’ll hear about Captain Becky’s background and how her father’s love of maritime fiction inspired her to pursue a career that seemed impossible until she learned about the windjammers in Maine. Her stories and experiences will illuminate why cruising on a windjammer is the ideal way to experience Maine...and we’ll find out why Maine is one of the only places in the world where visitors can still have these authentic nautical experiences.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays the sleepy Queensland town of Muttaburra is best known for the discovery of the towering dinosaur known as the Muttaburrasaurus. But it also boasts a number of other unusual finds, including the A.A. Cassimitis General Store Museum. 

The Cassimitis General Store Museum is a general store originally founded in 1918 that appears to have been later abandoned and preserved in time, with stocks of hardware, automotive supplies, crockery, and farm machinery all still on display.

In 1911, Andrew Andrew (A.A.) Cassimatis and his son George left their home on a Greek island to build a new life in Australia. After some time in Sydney, the father-son duo moved north and then west, finally landing in Muttaburra. A.A. and George built a general store in the town in 1918. The small store sold everything from groceries and hardware to automotive supplies. Eventually the Cassimatises expanded into other businesses: icemaking, soft drinks, agriculture, and more. 

The store closed not long after A.A. Cassimatis died in 1942. The building became a bank for a time, but in the 1990s, the Cassimatis General Store was restored as a museum celebrating the business that it once was.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-31T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The strikingly gorgeous stations of the Tashkent Metro may rival those in Moscow, even considered by some to be the most beautiful in the world. But they remain largely obscure because photography inside the metro was not only strictly forbidden, but illegal until June 2018.

Established in 1977, the Tashkent Metro is the oldest subway in Central Asia and seventh of the 13 metro systems in the former Soviet Union. It consists of four lines serving 48 stations, each of which is designed after a particular theme. The whole metro was originally planned to be a city-wide nuclear shelter, and the Uzbek government classified it as a military facility, which was the reason behind its decades-long ban on photography. 

The metro is home to a hidden underground world of arches and chandeliers, marble columns, and mosque-like vaults. The styles range from classical to retro-futuristic, a legacy of Soviet architecture. Many of the stations are decorated with murals depicting scenes of historic interest, from a wall of blue and yellow mosaic tiles to ceramic reliefs inspired by the poetry of Ali-Shir Nava'i.

One of the most notable stations is Kosmonavtlar ("Cosmonauts"), which is themed after space exploration. The architectural designs are inspired by the Milky Way, with specks of glass "stars" sparkling through the colonnade. Throughout the station, there are blue ceramic murals of space-related figures such as Ulugh Beg, Valentina Tereshkova, Yuri Gagarin, and even Icarus. The Alisher Navoiy station, on the other hand, leans more towards Islamic architecture, looking like a cyberpunk mosque.

The fourth line of the Tashkent Metro, Circle Line, was only recently completed in 2020, along with the northern terminus of Yunusobod Line, Turkiston. It may not be as retro as the other stations, but it is meant to be a culmination of the metro's history—combining the distinct styles of Soviet and traditional Uzbek architecture, a modern masterpiece.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A disputed church in Priština, located on the campus of the University of Priština, has a complex history. Originally planned as part of an open-plan campus in the 1970s, it was later given to the Serbian Orthodox Church by the municipality, leading to tension and disputes.

Construction began in 1992, but was halted multiple times due to a lack of funds as well as a deteriorating security situation in Kosovo. At first, the church was not well-received by all due to being seen as a symbol of Serbian rule. After all, according to Spasoje Krunić's design, the church would have 1,389 golden crosses—a reference to the year of the Battle of Kosovo, which is particularly important to Serbian history, tradition, and national identity at large.

After the war in 1999, the building survived attempts of destruction and was placed under protection. The future of the church remains uncertain, with ownership still being disputed between the University of Priština and the Serbian Orthodox Church. Calls for demolition have led to vandalism and desecration.

The Eparchy of Raška and Prizren conducted a religious ceremony on the grounds in 2021, sparking criticism and protests. The church, therefore, remains a contentious symbol in Pristina. Originally intended to be a prominent religious structure, it now stands as an urban semi-ruin, protected by a barbed wire fence set up by KFOR soldiers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The design of the former College Life Insurance Company headquarters, or the Pyramids as they are commonly known, was the brainchild of the famed architect Kevin Roche. For Roche (who trained under Eero Saarinen and designed such celebrated buildings as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Ford Foundation Headquarters), the inspiration for the buildings was a piece of concrete he saw on the side of the road, which resembled a pyramid.

At the time, Roche was working on a design for the College Life Insurance Company in Indianapolis. He thought the pyramidal concrete was an appropriately functional shape for the then-thriving business, which wanted to incrementally add building capacity as the size of its personnel grew. Roche's initial vision was to add additional pyramids as more office space was needed, for a total of nine buildings. However, only three were built during the initial construction period in 1971.

The three buildings, collectively known as the Pyramids, are the most impressive structures on the 200-acre College Park development. Built in a slick brutalist style, each building is constructed of two gleaming blue exterior walls supported by reinforced concrete, which comprise the other two walls. Each pyramid is 11 stories tall, contains over 120,000 square footage, and is connected via a network of underground and aboveground passages. All three overlook a 25-acre lake.

Today, the Pyramids are owned by Indiana-based real estate development firm KennMarr and are currently undergoing renovation. Sightseers need not worry, though: the exterior aesthetics that make the Pyramids so iconic will remain intact.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perched high above the Sonoma Coast, about three miles north of Fort Ross, is a striking obelisk that might catch your eye. Known as the Madonna of Peace, it's hidden in a tiny state park (the second smallest in California) right behind the Timber Cove Resort. 

The sculpture (also called "Peace Obelisk" or "The Expanding Universe") is one of several in Northern California by Italian artist Beniamino "Benny" Bufano and is an example of his anti-war viewpoint. The sculpture is shaped roughly like a missile, and was created around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was the final of his "projectiles of peace," completed just months before the artist died in 1970.

His first sculpture in the series was a 34-foot-tall monument simply titled Peace. It debuted at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Bufano wanted to build another, larger projectile of peace. In the 1950s, he traveled to the Soviet Union and proposed the idea to Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin, who declined the artist's offer.

But when Bufano was commissioned to create a sculpture in Timber Cove in the 1960s, he took the opportunity to create a towering monument to peace. The obelisk was built out of donated materials: redwood, steel, fiberglass, and mosaic tile. It took about a year to build the 68-foot body of the sculpture, but when it came time to place the head on top they found it was too heavy. For years, the head sat next to the base of the incomplete statue. In 1969, a special crane was brought in to lift the head into its rightful place, but it was accidentally placed backward. In February 1970, a second face was installed on the statue. Bufano died just a few months later in August.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the exoplanet (and, before that, eclipsing-binary) communities, transit-timing variations are described in terms of a quantity called O−C (pronounced “oh minus sea”), which is the difference between the observed transit time and the “computed” transit time. Right now, Abby Shaum (CUNY) and I are using this terminology in our manuscript about phase variations in coherent pulsators with companions, at the behest of Keaton Bell (CUNY). Okay fine! But O−C has this terrible property, which is that the C part depends on the period or frequency you assume. You can completely change the appearance or morphology of an O−C plot just by slightly tweaking the period. And there is no true period of course! There is just whatever estimates you can make. Which are, in turn, affected by what you use to model the O−C. So it is absolutely awful in every way. Not a stable observable, people! Not even .identifiable]]></summary>

Fröccs (roughly pronounced “frurtch") is a wine and soda water drink (it's always soda water, never fizzy mineral water) that's a summertime rite of passage in Budapest's ruin bars, café patios, and on many an apartment balcony or roof terrace. (Many people even have soda water delivered to their homes, à la the milkman of yore.) 

Drinking fröccs is a codified business. When it comes to ordering your glass, you have to decide if you are a "Mayor" (Polgármester), "Railway Watchman’s Mother-in-Law" (Bakteranyós), or a "Landlord" (Háziúr), to name just a few variations. The names represent the ratio of wine to soda water, measured in deciliters. While orders like the Mayor and Landlord correspond to respective ratios of 6:4 and 4:1, t…]]></summary>

The entire observatory is built around the Großer Refraktor (Great Refractor), an enormous cannon-like telescope designed by Friedrich Simon Archenhold. Unlike most other telescopes at the time, this one was freely rotating and made as long as possible to get the sharpest images it could.

The telescope, which is nicknamed the Himmelskanone (German for "celestial cannon" or "sky cannon"), was built for the 1896 Berlin Trade Exhibition, an event where new and revolutionary technology would be showcased. Unfortunately, the project took more time and money than expected, so it was completed late and without a proper building around it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some believe that these ruins gave their name to the nearby pit village of Bearpark.  The belief is the name is a corruption of the French term "Beau Repaire" the name given to the Priory.

Beaurepaire Priory was originally built by the Prior of Durham in charge of the Priory and Convent of Durham, Bertram de Middleton, in 1258 to be a country seat and his home in his retirement. It was visited by royalty on numerous occasions between 1296 and 1335, with visits by Kings Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III.

Over the centuries the priory was expanded several times. It took on a role similar to that of nearby Finchale Priory and acted as a retreat for the monks of Durham. The retreat was popular because, at just three miles from Durham City, it allowed the monks to attend daily mass easily.

The priory was heavily damaged following the nearby Battle of Neville's Cross and subsequently rebuilt and repaired by Prior Fossour. It suffered further during the British Civil War when the Priory was largely destroyed by the attacking Scots, with large assaults in 1640 and again four years later.

The park surrounding the priory supplied it with wood, coal, and building materials. It was also used as a stud for the prior's horses.

Most of what is left of Beaurepaire ranges from ankle-high to waist-high ruined walls.  However, there are a few sections that tower over visitors and with imagination it is possible to conceive that this was a once magnificent building.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Buddhism, the Five Hundred Arhats are the most loyal of the Buddha’s disciples, who attended the religion's first council at Rājagṛha (modern Rajgir) right after the Buddha's final nirvana to compile his teachings into scriptures. Several Japanese and Chinese temples are home to statues of the Arhats, which are said to bring good luck to visitors.

One of Japan’s three most popular arhat temple is Kita-in in Kawagoe, a quaint city about an hour away from Tokyo. Its famed sculpture garden contains a total of 538 statues, including the Great Buddha, Amitabha, Ksitigarbha, and the Bodhisattvas.

They were sculpted in the late Edo period, from 1782 to 1825, at the suggestion of a local monk named Shijo. They have since stood in the temple garden, collecting layers of moss and lichen.

Interestingly, the sculptures are not all serious and hard-faced. There is an endearing sense of humor to many of the arhats at Kita-in Temple, a touch of human nature, something even relatable to us living two centuries ahead of them.

For example, one arhat can be seen reclining and taking up his neighbor's space, who appears to be (understandably) annoyed but keeping it cool. Another arhat lies resting his cheeks on his hands, in a manner perhaps resembling that of a teenage girl gossiping at a sleepover. While some meditate solemnly, some are laughing, crying, sneezing, and there is even a monk who is definitely picking his nose.

Each of the arhat statues is uniquely sculpted, making it a fun experience to explore the enclosure and enjoy the multi-faceted essence of Buddhist art.]]></summary>

It had a 30-foot tower, walls nine feet and nine inches thick, and housed three large cannons and one smaller one. A few years later casemates were added, and by 1870, the fort got a major makeover, inspired by the threat of Napoleon III. A new battery was added, able to hold up to 175 soldiers and five officers. Most of the fort’s useful life was spent undergoing upgrades, and it only really saw active use during World War I. In 1929 it was finally …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing that physics and mechanical engineering students learn early on is that there are often analogies between charge flow and heat flow, and this is reflected in the mathematical models we use to describe charge and heat transport.  We use Ohm's law, \(\mathbf{j}=\tilde{\sigma}\cdot \mathbf{E}\), which defines an electrical conductivity tensor \(\tilde{\sigma}\) that relates charge current density \(\mathbf{j}\) to electric fields \(\mathbf{E}=-\nabla \phi\), where \(\phi(\mathbf{r})\) is the electric potential.  Similarly, we can use Fourier's law for thermal conduction, \(\mathbf{j}_{Q} = - \tilde{\kappa}\cdot \nabla T\), where \(\mathbf{j}_{Q}\) is a heat current density, \(T(\mathbf{r})\) is the temperature distribution, and \(\tilde{\kappa}\) is the thermal conductivity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometime around 1933, two teenage cousins, Harry Hall and Will Cubbon, paid a visit to a new friend of theirs named Gef. Gef lived in a remote, windswept farmhouse on the Isle of Man. He was very shy, and the cousins could hear and talk to him, but never saw their new friend. From behind a wall, Gef would guess heads-or-tails when a coin was flipped or play catch with a rubber ball through a hole in the attic ceiling.

But soon, Gef began misbehaving: spitting and threatening the boys that he would “wet on [their] head!” Gef, it turns out, was no normal boy—he was a poltergeist in the form of a talking mongoose.

Doarlish Cashen, the farmhouse where Gef resided, was in many ways the stereotypical haunted house. It was an ancient farmstead on a notoriously fairy-filled, desolate isle, sit…]]></summary>

U.S. Highway 6, named the "Grand Army of the Republic" highway in honor of the Union Army during the Civil War, was one of the earliest coast-to-coast numbered routes. It was extended into Nevada in 1937, the stretch from Ely (pronounced "EE-lee") to Tonopah following the Midland Trail, an early “national auto trail” also called the Roosevelt Trail.

The route of U.S. 6 in Nevada has gone largely unchanged since 1937. It crosses Nevada mostly to the south of US 50, and in the nearly 300 miles between the Utah state line and the California state line, there are only two towns with populati…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-30T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the township of Itakura, Gunma, a bizarre sculpture lurks in the sleepy, poorly-lit lobby of a local community center. 

An eldritch entity composed of countless coleopteran corpses in the style of Oogie Boogie, the Konchū Senju-Kannon is the stuff of entomophobic nightmares. Haloed by the iridescent sheen of jewel beetles’ carapaces and crowned with a longicorn cocoon, the goddess sits on a throne of creepy-crawlies with the mandibles of stag beetles jutting out in every direction. At her feet, a swarm of drone beetles make up the pedestal, giving a bronze-green luster to it.

Neatly composed of over 20,000 insect specimens, the Konchū Senju-Kannon ("thousand-armed insect goddess of mercy") was created over a span of six years by one Mr. Inamura, an Itakura local who pursued the hobby of insect collecting. In Japan, the collector's typical game consists of different kinds of beetles, such as the rhinoceros, stag, and longicorn, quite common in the countryside.

Bright green with tints of rainbow, the jewel beetle has been highly valued for its rare beauty since antiquity, most notably used in the eighth century to make the Tamamushi Shrine of Hōryū-ji. No doubt inspired by this National Treasure, the goddess of Itakura is also modeled after the Kannon statue enshrined at Tōshōdai-ji Temple.

Perhaps ironically, this particular statue is dedicated to all the lives of insects lost at the hands of mankind, be it a victim of pesticide or specimen-making. Known as mushi-kuyō, the practice of memorializing insects is not itself an uncommon tradition in Japanese Buddhism (as seen in Ueno and Kamakura) if not as elaborate as the Insect Goddess.

Depending on the viewer, the goddess may be breathtaking or stomach-turning, exquisite or eccentric, a work of goodwill or hypocrisy. Regardless of your opinion, she continues to sit in the shadows in a perpetual state of prayer, full of mercy towards the little creatures.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The key thing to make your code run faster is to avoid building large linear-algebra objects. For example, if you need to get the matrix product A.x, where A is a huge matrix and x is a long vector, and you only ever use the matrix A to do this one multiply by x, there is no reason to actually create A. Just create a function that evaluates A.x for any input x. That should be way faster, because of less memory allocation, and because you don't have to make the parts of the matrix that are all zeros (for example).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Jimbocho district of Tokyo is known for its decades-old cafés. Viennese coffee was first introduced to the Japanese public in 1953 at the Ladrio, one of the java joints situated in a narrow alley. The rich, potent concoction quickly became a favorite spot of countless authors, artists, publishers, bibliophiles, and college students, who liked it as it stayed hot underneath the thick layer of whipped cream as they sat discussing for hours on end.

That same year, the café opened a sister location right across the alley named “Milongo,” which advertised itself as an Argentine tango café. It may seem like a niche genre today, but post-war Japan was in the midst of a dance craze at the time. Its influences are also evident in some of the popular music of the later Shōwa era.

Milonga has maintained its musical theme over the years, even after the fever all but died out elsewhere. To this day, it keeps on playing Argentine tango music on vinyl, filling the warmly lit room with comfortable Latin crooning and phonographic crackles. 

The café underwent a major renovation in 1995 and renamed itself as Milonga Nueva: the new Milonga. It was now home to charcoal-roasted coffee and numerous brands of beer from around the world, even while the music remained. To this day, the interior is decorated with an impressive collection of vintage LP records, books, bottles and coasters.

In 2023, the Milonga Nueva had to relocate due to the original brick-walled building growing deteriorated from age. Fortunately, it did not stray much farther, spiritually or physically. Even though it's now housed in a newer building, the vibe hasn't changed drastically; Argentine tango still plays all day, and the menu boasts smoky coffee and a good selection of beer, along with its famous pizza, Japanese-style curry, and biscotti.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Eastern Europeans, arcades elicit a healthy dose of nostalgia—perhaps even more so than people from other places with a history of arcades.

In Eastern Europe, arcades survived well into the 2000s as a viable business model. Often in the form of mobile arcades that drove around to smaller towns in the summer. The Krakow Arcade Museum brings all of that back to life with a massive collection of over 100 vintage machines.

In communist Poland, a single arcade machine could cost as much as a new car and would cost about .50 Euros to play a machine. Despite that, they were massively popular. Most machines paid themselves off within a month and went on the make a profit after that. 

A lot of arcade machines lasted well into the 2000s in dedicated arcades or on game trucks that drove to smaller towns and villages.

Today, the Krakow Arcade Museum has collected over 100 games ranging from classics, such as Packman, to newer games, such as Dance Dance Revolution. At the arcade, you pay per hour of play. This way you do not have to worry about coins or credits, but can just play whatever you want.]]></summary>

Moss and ferns dot the sides of the sandstone, and gorges get narrower the further in you go, giving it a tunnel-like quality. Wildlife such as raccoons can be seen even during the day tucked away in the holes on the sides of the canyon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dunadd Fort rises tall from what is called Moine Mhor, meaning the "great moss" an expanse of flat boggy land at the southern end of Kilmartin Glen. The site was the center of power for the Gaelic kings of Dál Riata, who ruled Scotland from about 500 to 800. Dunadd is one of the few places referenced in early histories, with its first mention in the year 673.

It is obvious why Dunadd was considered a desirable position to build a fortification and why it went on to become the center of a kingdom. Standing in a natural boggy basin, the fort sits on top of the hillside, which was put to good use as part of the fort's natural defenses. To get to the citadel at the top level of the hill you have to pass through a narrow natural passage, as well as a series of terraces, each with the remains …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 1950s, the new West Berlin government called many famous architects from all across the world to come and rebuild the destroyed city. One of these architects was Le Corbusier. The Swiss-French architect, writer, designer, urban planner, and painter was then at the height of his renown. Le Corbusier, who was born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, had by then already designed several of these "Unité d'Habitation" apartment buildings. The first was in Marseille in 1952, followed by one in Nantes, France in 1955.

When he presented his plans for the Unité d'Habitation of Berlin to the West Berlin government, the building was deemed too large to be built in the city's center. Eventually, construction began in 1956 in an outer Berlin suburb known as Flatowallee. 

Le Corbusier and local authorities had more disagreements, however. The original plan of the building called for many community amenities, including such as a kindergarten on the roof and shops on the seventh floor. But those amenities were never built, and instead, giving way to more housing. 

The apartments were also altered from Le Corbusier's original plan. German building regulations required the carefully designed spaces to have taller ceilings--something that to Le Corbusier's mind disrupted the balance of the space. 

Eventually, a children's playground was added on the grounds and a laundrette, bank, supermarket, and post office were all crammed into the first floor. But Le Corbusier was already fed up with the project by then and refused to have any association with it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Moche civilization, also known as the Mochica culture, was an ancient civilization that thrived along the northern coast of present-day Peru from around the years 100 to 800. Renowned for their impressive artistic achievements, advanced agricultural practices, erotic pottery, and complex social organization, the Moche people left a lasting impact on the region's history.

Religion played a central role in Mochica society. They worshipped a pantheon of deities, with the "Decapitator" being one of the most prominent figures that was often depicted in their art. Ritual human sacrifices were performed to appease these gods and ensure agricultural prosperity and social order. 

Moche is also the name of a town located near the city of Trujillo on the northern coast of Peru. While this town is known for its renowned beaches along the Pacific Ocean, a hidden history awaits those who seek it. A pathway adorned with contemporary depictions of Mochica Gods, now winds its way towards these shores.

Embark on a unique journey where each deity comes to life through modern sculptures portraying eerie or awe-inspiring creatures. From the enigmatic half-man and half-crab, to the imposing humanoid evil-looking fish, a total of 10-20 statues bring their stories to life. Each statue is accompanied by informative details about the corresponding deity. (You can find a similar assemblage of statues in the town of Chiclayo, Peru, called the Paseo Yortuque.)

As you traverse this evocative pathway, you'll encounter illustrated arcs that add an extra layer of aesthetic detail. The route culminates close to the ocean's edge, offering a seamless segue for visiting the beaches of Acapulco or Playa de las Delicias.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Led by artist and stonemason Austin Emery, 'The Cornerstone' is a community artwork made up of numerous individual hand-carved stone blocks.

The blocks were created by public participants consisting of 100 children and adults from the nearby Whites Grounds Estates, as well as the wider community, in public workshops who sported goggles, mallets, and chisels for the effort. What makes the work more curious is that the stone blocks consisted of fragments from Southwark Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, and the Houses of Parliament, as well as bone fragments found on the foreshore of the Thames.

This is symbolic in the art piecing together aspects of London's history, especially that of Bermondsey, which was once a bustling area of commerce due to its proximity to the Thames. The idea was to create a piece of living art heritage for the communities from the estates around Bermondsey.

As a result, a quirky and eye-catching creation now stands as a sort of landmark in this rather touristic part of town, the artist having initiated the project with the goal of making a project further influenced by residents of the area.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go-en is a significant aspect of Japanese culture, a unique concept of relationship, causality, serendipity, opportunity, and fate. It's somewhat similar in spirit to the phrase "God willing" in monotheistic cultures, but more hopeful and associated with good luck in general. The word is also commonly used in romantic context, and many Shinto shrines are popular for their influence in en-musubi ("tying the knot").

Takagi Shrine in Sumida City, Tokyo, is one of the few shrines in Japan dedicated to Takami-Musubi, an androgynous deity of creation and birth, who was born as the second entity in the universe's history according to Japanese mythology. Because of their name, the shrine is associated with the concept of en-musubi, as well as, well, rice balls.

In Japan, rice balls are known as onigiri and omusubi, meaning "clasped" and "fastened," respectively. At Takagi Shrine, you can find them everywhere, piles of tiny pebbles with cute faces and seaweed wrappers drawn on them. Hidden like Easter eggs, even in the guardian lion-dog's mouth, the rounded triangles are easily distinguishable and can be also seen in the prayer boards, amulets, you name it. Visitors can also take a tiny "musubi stone" home upon purchasing a goshuin stamp.

Interestingly, despite the extensive musubi-inspired theming, the shrine's main subject of worship was not Takami-Musubi when it was established in 1468 AD. Prior to the Shinto-Buddhism separation of 1868, the shrine was managed by the adjacent Buddhist temple and originally known as Dairokutensha, dedicated to Dairoku-Tenma-Ō, the "Devil King of the Sixth Heaven."

Identified with the demon Mara, this Buddhist Devil is known as an evil tempter and deceiver of monks. In spite of that, there still are multiple Dairokutensha shrines across Japan. Some believe that they may have been influenced by Oda Nobunaga, the most infamous warlord of feudal Japan, who gave himself the moniker of the Devil King to instill fear into his enemies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coastal Peru is a landscape of deep-cut ravines and the glacial melt of Andes-spawned rivers cascading through narrow, arid corridors to a waiting Pacific Ocean. If you look at a modern road map of the country, you will see a network of highways cutting northeast through the mountains, linking the high plateau of the Amazonian interior to the dry cliffs overlooking the sea. 

These present-day roads mimic the footpaths of ancient people who migrated to South America and sought their own routes to the coast, finding fertile, protected valleys along the way where they created something spectacular. We don’t yet know exactly when these people first arrived in what is now Peru, but we do know when they built the civilization at Caral-Supe: 2627 B.C.

And that date is, in a word, stunning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since leaving my native Norway, I find myself constantly telling people about brunost. Pronounced “broon’ust,” it simply means “brown cheese.” But brunost is nothing like any other cheese.

The taste starts with a salty, rich caramel, and under the sweetness there’s a pleasant funk, courtesy of a mix of goat’s and cow’s milk. Eating it is momentarily overwhelming, as it sticks to the roof of your mouth before melting away. Its dense, sticky texture even requires a cheese plane, a special spatula-shaped tool for shaving off long pieces.

It used to be nearly impossible to get brunost outside of Norway, but in recent years, it’s become a craze in an unlikely place—South Korea. Brunost is now everywhere across the nation, from cafes to street food stands. Interestingly, Koreans have made br…]]></summary>

The grand home was the seat of the Montgomerie family, who held the title of Earls of Eglinton. The Montgomerie family was among William the Conqueror's most powerful allies. After his success at the Battle of Hastings, William rewarded the family with extensive lands across both England and Scotland. The original castle was burnt in 1528 by the Earl of Glencairn, who was also responsible for many raids on nearby Kilwinning Abbey during the same period.

In 1797, the earl began work on an extravagant new residence. The architect was John Patterson, who had trained under the …]]></summary>

During that trip, it became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, specifically the European Space Agency's Giotto. An illustration of Giotto appears in the middle of the comet.

Wiley Post had used his old but trusty Winnie Mae for both his round-the-world trips. However, Winnie Mae was now outdated, and Post needed a new aircraft for his Alaska-Russia venture. Struggling for funds, Post decided to piece together a plane that would suit his needs. 

Starting with a fuselage from a Lockheed Orion, Post added extra-long wings from a Lockheed Explorer. He then changed out the regular engine and replaced it with a 550-horsepower Wasp engine that was 145 pounds heavier t…]]></summary>

The tunnels are full of dining options and various shopping/service locations catered towards the employees of all the offices occupying the buildings above.

The tunnel system has been around for nearly a century. The earliest known tunnels date back to the 1930s. According to the Houston Chronicle, one of the first tunnels connected two buildings owned by former Texas Governor Ross Sterling: the Houston Post-Dispatch and the Sterling Building. The tunnel ran beneath Fannin Street. Around the same time, entertainment entrepreneur Will Horwitz had a tunnel connecting his three theaters, the Travis, the Texan, and the Uptown.

According to architectural historian Stephen Fox, the idea of a system of shared tunnels came about in 1956, when the Bank of the Southwest was linked to the 1010 Garage and the Mellie Esperson Building. As the city grew in the 60s and 70s, so did the underground tunnels.

Each section of the tunnels has its own aesthetic, often an extension of the buildings directly above, which vary wildly from haphazard and dingy to spacious and modern. The tunnels are only open during the weekday business hours.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-08-29T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nicknamed "the HydroCake" by the construction company Hydrostorage, Inc., this iconic water tower was built to provide support to the newly opened dairy processing plant, frozen food warehouse, and expanded bakery plant. And boy, does it do its job well - with the ability to deliver a whopping 250,000 gallons of water per minute.

But let's talk about the real star of the show here: the cake itself. Standing at a staggering 146 feet tall, this tower is like the world's biggest, baddest, most delicious birthday cake. And let's not forget the candles—10 in total, each representing five years of Publix history. And that eleventh candle in the middle? That's for the years to come.

This tower is made up of a whopping 2.25 million pounds of steel, secured by two tons of welding rods, and resting on a foundation of 170 cubic yards of concrete. It's like the Hulk of water towers—strong, sturdy, and built to last. And those candles are no slouches either. Each one stands at a towering eight feet tall and weighs in at a solid 250 pounds. That's like having 10 Shaquille O'Neals perched on top of your water tower.

But perhaps the best part of the Publix Birthday Cake water tower is the way it lights up the night sky. Every evening, the lights at the top of the tower turn on, and that center candle serves as an aerial blinker, like a delicious lighthouse guiding ships to safety. It's a sight to behold, and one that has served as an iconic beacon in the Lakeland community for years.

The tower has become a symbol of the community and a beacon of hope for those who call Lakeland their home. It's a structure that represents the strength and resilience of the people of Lakeland.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It might be a stretch to call this place a botanical garden. Bone menagerie. Pseudo-science workshop. Psychedelic trip through a macabre, outdoor fantasy world would all be more appropriate. But it’s well worth the €10 entrance fee, if only for the bizarre photos.

The island of Bonaire has long been a mecca for scuba divers, especially those who enjoy shore dives. With 63 official dive sites on the main island—marked with distinctive, yellow-painted rocks—and another 26 easily accessed from a boat on the adjacent island of Klein Bonaire, most people choose to spend their time diving and snorkeling along the southern and western coasts and enjoying the excellent seafood restaurants found in the capital of Kralendijk.

But the northern and eastern coasts of this boomerang-shaped island are known as the “wild side”. Windward and rocky, the wild side boasts a national park, blow holes, petroglyphs, and the Bonaire Botanical Garden. This is a privately-owned garden, so don’t expect a national park-caliber tour. Instead, you should expect the unexpected and take most of it with a grain of salt.

If you’re lucky, Manuel, the owner of the garden, will be there to take you on the tour. He will detail his inspiration for many of the art exhibits built from found materials and animal bones, share his beliefs on the healing properties of various plants, and extol the supposed virtues of drinking quantities of seawater daily.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduced in 1633, the Sangpyeong Tongbo coinage was first issued by a government famine relief organization called the Stabilization Office, or Sangpyeong-chong in Korean, during the reign of Emperor Injo. Variations of this coin would continue to be issued for years after this, up until 1884.

A small section in the Bank of Korea’s currency museum, dubbed the Sangpyeongtongbo Gallery, focuses on the history and many varieties of the Joseon dynasty’s most widely circulated coinage.

Reportedly, the Bank of Korea’s collection once possessed 3,137 different varieties, but it’s estimated that Sangpyeong Tongbo boasted over 5,000 varieties throughout its history, many now lost and undocumented. Originally minted at the Stabilization Office, the coins were later issued by other government offices as well, each variety bearing a different mint mark.

In the mid-18th century, other marks were also introduced, indicating the number of the furnace the coin was cast in. They were represented by a single Chinese character, such as those standing for the Chinese zodiac, the five elements, and the Thousand Character Classic.

The Bank of Korea also boasts a collection of cash-shaped amulets, including the so-called open-work charms. One is even shaped after a pair of fish (or maybe a fish cut open), a fanciful amulet you might not realize it’s even coin-shaped at first glance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Hoi An Ancient Town is a popular destination in Vietnam, with narrow bustling streets full of historic monuments and traditional lanterns, charming shops and restaurants, as well as beach resorts close by.

Among such vibrant places of interest, a small museum dedicated to local archaeology is not likely to attract crowds of tourists, especially when there are other museums focusing on Hoi An’s history and cultural lifestyles. Nevertheless, the Museum of Sa Huỳnh Culture offers a fascinating look into Vietnam’s Iron Age, which flourished in the region between the 10th century BCE and the 4th century CE.

Named after a small village in Quảng Ngãi Province where the first site was found in 1909, Sa Huỳnh culture is known for its ironware, gemstone beads, and terra-cotta burial jars, not unlike those found in the Philippines.

It is known that Sa Huỳnh, the Philippines, as well as Taiwan, Borneo, and Thailand, were connected along an ancient trade route. Sa Huỳnh is one of the few cultures that made ling-ling-o, a type of ancient ring-shaped amulet in the ancient Philippines, using jade imported from Taiwan.

Founded in 1994, the Museum of Sa Huỳnh Culture is home to nearly 1,000 locally sourced artifacts, the largest of its kind. One of its major highlights is the exhibit of burial jars on the second floor.]]></summary>

And given the adaptability of these flying mammals, it’s quite likely there will be bats wherever you are.

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”]]></title>

What is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? 

One is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. 

Similarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.]]></title>
