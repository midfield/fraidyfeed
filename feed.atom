        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nullarbor Roadhouse is one of the few resting places on the Nullarbor Plain, known for its vast, arid landscape in the region.

Originally operating as a remote outback station, the Nullarbor Station covered acres of land with paddocks of horses, sheep, and cattle grazing. As the infrastructure of Australia grew, a decision was made by the station manager in 1956 to begin selling petroleum to the hardy passersby who navigated the arduous gravel roads at that time. 

A small shop soon was then built, selling snacks and drinks and the Nullarbor Roadhouse then became a much-needed rest stop. In 1976, the Eyre Highway was completed and this allowed much easier access for those making the journey across the Nullarbor Plain.

At this time, a new roadhouse building was built and the same building has been restored with original artifacts to allow visitors to take a step back in time. The old building contains historic signs, original food and drink packaging, and an old petroleum pump, all of which have shown significant decay due to the extreme weather conditions here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally named Wat Kok Khwai, the Buddhist temple now known as Wat Yannawa or the “Boat Temple” was built during the Ayutthaya era, before the founding of Bangkok. It was merely a local place of worship until King Rama I granted it royal status and made the ordination hall known as subosot in Thai.

During the reign of Rama III (1824-1851), a defining feature was added to the temple complex: a viharn (monastery) in the shape of a Chinese junk. At the time, the junk ship was becoming obsolete and starting to be replaced by newer, more modern vessels. It is believed that King Rama III wished to preserve the image of the Chinese junk in the mind of his people.

Thanks to this unique feature, it was not long before the locals started to coin its nickname, Wat Yannawa (literally “boat temple”), which would stick and become its official name. With the two chedis designed to resemble masts, it also gained the nickname Sampao Chedi, the “Chinese junk with chedis,” as it looked more like a ship than a temple.

Today, besides the junk-shaped viharn, the temple complex contains multiple buildings enshrining images and a relic of the Buddha, effigies of Kuan Im, the goddess of mercy, and large paintings of the Loy Krathong lantern festival. In front of the “boat” stands a bronze statue of Rama III, looking proud that his image of the Chinese junk has lived on beyond his life.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beneath the streets of Windsor lies a time capsule, buried in 2011 and sealed for 50 years. Its contents encapsulate through images, information, and videos, what the town of Windsor was like in 2011. However, it's not the capsule that captures the attention of passersby.

Fixed within the pavement is a working clock, ticking away under the feet of pedestrians. It was installed alongside the time capsule below, it sits within the same space as a previous pavement clock, originally installed in 1950. Sir Cyril Dyson, jeweler and clockmaker for the queen, sunk the clock into the pavement outside his shop as a showcase of his skills. The original clock went missing in the 1980s following the closure of Dyson’s store.

The pavement clock of Windsor is thought to be one of a kind in Britain, and those brave enough to level their ear to the timepiece have reported the distinct tick-tock of its mechanism emanating from below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An hour and a half south of Washington, D.C. lies a small air museum with a remarkable collection, including one-of-a-kind airplanes.

Sidney Shannon Jr. was a businessman and pilot whose father was one of the founders of Eastern Air Lines. In 1950, Shannon founded Shannon Airport, an airport for general aviation (small, private planes) just outside of Fredericksburg, Virginia.

An air museum on the property was opened in 1976. From its beginning, the museum has housed a collection of rare aircraft from the "golden age of flight". Following Sidney Shannon's death in 1981, the future of the airport and museum was uncertain. For a while, the collection was moved to another museum in Richmond. In 2017, however, the museum was reopened and the collection returned to its original home.

Several of the aircraft on exhibit, including the Vultee V-1AD Special, are the only remaining example of their type. Other rare aircraft include a Pitcairn Mailwing PA-5 and a Bellanca CH-400 Skyrocket.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visiting St. Peter Stiftskulinarium is a spiritual and gastronomic pilgrimage.  Located within the expansive confines of Salzburg's St. Peter's Abbey, a 7th-century Benedictine monastery, its existence was first chronicled by Alcuin of York, a scholar and trusted advisor to Charlemagne.

Wandering these hallowed halls, one can’t help but imagine Mephistopheles talking shop with Faust, or Christopher Columbus raising a glass of Salzburg Stiegl beer before his historic voyage. While legends persist, the establishment’s age is undeniable. St. Peter Stiftskulinarium, mentioned in documents dating back to 803, claims to be the oldest known operating restaurant in Europe.

The restaurant’s grandeur extends across 11 dining rooms, each with its own elaborate design and tapestry of captivating anecdotes. From the opulent Baroque Hall to the intimate “citizens’ room” Prälatenstube, the establishment is certainly a feast for the eyes. With an 850-person capacity, it also offers ample opportunity for people-watching.

The Stiftskulinarium’s kitchen prides itself on serving upscale regional specialties, including the Viennese classic tafelspitz (slow-simmered beef in broth and vegetables) and Salzburger Nockerl a sweet dessert soufflé made with egg yolk, flour, sugar and vanilla. With changing seasons, the menu embraces diverse local flavors, showcasing fresh fish, game dishes, and often imaginative influences from Mediterranean cuisine.

As twilight descends, the restaurant’s renowned Mozart Dinner Concert takes place. Every night, the Baroque Hall’s high stuccoed ceilings are illuminated by candlelight across white gala tables. In collaboration with the Salzburg Concert Society, the dining experience features a three-course menu of authentic 17th- and 18th-century recipes accompanied by live musical performances featuring the work of Salzsburg’s most famous native, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Performers and stewards in fanciful period attire add to the time-warp flair.]]></summary>

In a rural town along the San Juan River in southeastern Utah, an esteemed botanist and local innkeeper got to talking in the summer of 1937. Together, the pair hatched a plan—to run the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. A journey like theirs had never before been attempted. The University of Michigan botanist, Elzada Clover, intended to make the first-ever botanical survey of the river and its environs. The innkeeper, Norman Nevills, wanted to commercialize trips down the Colorado River (despite never having run the river himself). The next summer Clover and Nevills, along with two other boatmen, a photographer, and botanist Lois Jotter, Elzada’s close…]]></summary>

The art was designed and constructed by local artist Brian Paskins and was unveiled to the public on January 31, 2002. The town sits on the tip of the North West Cape of Australia and is well known for the marine life found here, making it a popular spot for tourists snorkeling and diving on the Ningaloo Reef.  

Whale sharks are one of many species that can be found off the coast of Exmouth and this sculpture pays tribute to their migration to the reef between the months of March to June. They are the largest species of sharks and visit the Ningaloo Reef due to the mass spawning of coral which brings abundant feeding opportunities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many universities across the world have their own museums dedicated to a variety of subjects and collections. Regis College in Weston, Massachusettes has one located on the southern edge of its campus. However, this location is quite distinctive as it's one of the few museums in the United States dedicated to the study and collecting of postage stamps, also known as Philately.

Founded in 1961, the Spellman Museum of Stamps & Postal History, or the Cardinal Spellman Philatelic Museum is the oldest museum of its kind in the United States. It is also the second largest collection of philatelic material after the National Postal Museum operated by the Smithsonian. Its founder was Cardinal Francis Spellman, who served as the sixth Archbishop of New York from 1939 to 1967 and previously as the auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston from 1932 to 1939. He was also an avid philatelic.

Today, the museum contains over two million items including Spellman's personal collection, pieces from the former National Philatelic Museum in Philadelphia as well as donations from the general public.

Its principal mission is to preserve and promote knowledge of history, geography, art, culture, architecture, science, and nature through the story of stamps and postage.]]></summary>

Kelp is common along temperate shorelines around the world. For millennia, this large brown algae has been vital to coastal Indigenous peoples. In Washington State and British Columbia, kelp is a traditional food source, a focus for commercial cultivation, and habitat for critically endangered and threatened species like rockfish and young salmon. It’s hard to overstate kelp’s value. For the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe, says shellfish biologist Annie Raymond, “you can’t quantify how important this biodiversity is, culturally.”

Despite (or because of) our familiarity with it, however, advertisement largely remains an underappreciated art form. The Ad Museum Tokyo was established in 2002 to turn people’s eyes to the fun, creative ideas that lie in ads.

Set in chronological order, the museum starts off its permanent exhibition with a variety of business tricks from the Edo period, the last of Japan's feudal periods, circa 1603-1867. It suggests that the world's first marketing genius may have been Takatoshi Mitsui, a claim supported by famed management consultant Peter Drucker.

But their system has some pathologies, which we discussed last week. I think I know how to solve some of them. My document is reporting those thoughts.GaiaGaia
Writing like this reminds me of graduate school: One of my advisors (Blandford) often encouraged me to write up thoughts, ideas, projects, and proposals, even when we had no intention of submitting them anywhere.

The architect Dal Nagle designed and built it in 1968 for Sam Bell, owner of Bell Brand Snack Foods. He wanted a futuristic-looking house that could withstand naturally occurring rock slides, earthquakes, and waves.

The original name was the Bell Pavillion, and you could access it from the cliffs via a nearly vertical tramway that ran almost 300 feet down the cliff. It was also used as a guest house, offering a 180-degree view from Torrey Pines State Park to La Jolla.

The house is currently abandoned, and its cliffside tram hasn't run in years. Though it sits in a state of disrepair along the San Diego beach, the sturdy concrete structure remains intact.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know the feeling. The door opens onto a white expanse. The light is overwhelming; you can feel it in your head and instinctively raise a hand to cover your eyes. Then the white fades out to the edges. You might see green on the trees, or the blue of water, or the gray of a motel parking lot. It’s summer. There’s a breeze. And you have a whole day and night ahead of you.

This is how we at Atlas Obscura think of the beginning of summer—blinding, then full of opportunity and the potential for adventure. To celebrate that feeling and the potential it carries, this year we’re presenting our first-ever season-long special section: Summer of Wonder.

For the next three months, we’re going to be exploring three themes that capture some of the magic of being outside in the summertime:


On the Road: Road tripping and roadside attractions, modern and historical

Summer Nights: Starry skies, fireflies, and nostalgia

Go Wild: Encounters with the natural world (with a preview of one of Atlas Obscura’s big new projects)


Summer of Wonder will include stories that explore overlooked corners of history, food, and the natural world, as well as recommendations that can help you make the most of your escapades—from itineraries and roadside geology, to stargazing and recognizing some of the creatures you might meet (or dream of) along the way.

Charge your battery or fill up your tank. We’ve got miles ahead of us.]]></summary>

It was a place to sneak away to with friends in spring to play in the flowers until the early 2000s. The property is now called Parson Reserve and is a part of the DNRT Trust. The first daffodils were planted on the property during World War II and now there are thousands of them throughout the woods.

The trails are open year-round but the best time to see the flowers is in the spring (April). The daffodil field is up a steep wooded trail and hidden from view of the road. The trails DNRT keeps up the trails and they are lightly marked so it's easy to find the way. People aren't allowed to walk or pick the flowers anymore, but there are narrow walking paths through them.]]></summary>

So they made it their mission to seek out what lay beyond these limited search results. And what they found was a world brimming with everything from Pakistani hot chicken and Uzbek dumplings to Turkish flatbreads and roast brisket on rye.

“There's this multiculturalism of different kinds of restaurants and people just wanting to try other people's food,” says Azad, one-third of the team of food bloggers known collectively as Muslim Foodies. Since 2017, Azad, Choudhry, and Baksh have reviewed around 370 New York area halal restaurants for their blog and gained an international…]]></summary>

This wasn't just any juice stand. It was Gibeau Orange Julep, a towering dome run by a family that’s slung their orange juleps—a creamier take on squeezed citrus, thanks to the addition of powdered egg—since the 1930s.

"Most people spend, like, a year planning that," he laughs. "I just go."

Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life

By Dacher Keltner

In January, Atlas Obscura spoke with Dacher Keltner, a leading expert on the biology of human emotion and a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, about the science of awe and how it impacts our experience of the world. His book takes a closer look at how this phenomenon has shaped human stories across cultures and time—and how it may play a role in your summer adventu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The coast-to-coast road trip, that American essential, turns 120 this year. In 1903, Horatio Jackson and Sewall Crocker became the first people ever to drive a car from one side of the United States all the way to the other.

Cars were an exciting novelty at the time, and their numbers were exploding—from 8,000 in 1900 to 32,920 in 1903—but many still considered the “horseless carriage” a passing fad. There were few suitable roads, let alone a nationwide road network. So theirs was an adventure like none before. And it all started with a $50 bet.

This map is from the 1907 edition of the Automobile Association of America’s Blue Book. It shows the routes of all the cross-country car trips completed until then: no more than 11 in total—and strangely, all duos. (The Jackson-Crocker trip is …]]></summary>

Others stake their spots along OC’s narrow beaches, pitching enormous umbrellas and spreading out their chairs and blankets. There’s no question about it: the season of “shoobies'' has begun.

At first, the bodies are easy to overlook. But as summer progresses on Tuckernuck Island off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, more and more victims turn up. Their mangled corpses litter the roads and driveways. Despite their headless state, these victims are easy to identify. They are Narceus americanus, the American giant millipede. And no one knows what is killing them.

For decades, scientists have tried to find the answer to the question of why the headless millipedes turn up by the hundreds every summer on Tuckernuck. This phenomenon, on this scale, happens nowhere else on Earth. Identifying the culprit has implications beyond this small, sandy island: whatever animal is ultimately responsible, the answer may reveal a bran…]]></summary>

Various take-homes include that we need to mitigate lots of stellar noise, and that we care deeply about the covariance (as a function of separation in time) of adjacent measurements. I advocated that we split our ten-year survey into two or three surveys, of varying length. In the first, we learn about the stars, and in the last, we go to town on the very most promising targets. There was general agreement that this is a good idea. But now we need a very specific plan for what this means. As my loyal reader knows, in my view, the decisions must be based on repeatable operations, so that we have some hope of learning statistical things about populations in the end.]]></summary>

The picture shows some solutions to a relatively low-degree Diophantine equation (no more than degree 4, and probably even just degree 3), and the arrows show how a solution can be modified to create a new solution. The coefficients are integers, of course. … Continue reading A Diophantine puzzle]]></summary>

My mind was blown by Ben Lakeland (Exeter), who showed  data of the Sun, and then showed that, from these images, he can predict the magnetic-activity-generated RV signals in simultaneous EPRV measurements of the Solar RV. That's pretty exciting. He also showed that much of the time, the RV variations are dominated not by magnetic activity . If we are going to beat one meter per second, we are going to have to correct for convective shifts. Somehow!?Terra HuntingSolar Dynamics Orbiterper se]]></summary>

I've drawn pictures like this, but I hadn't worked out the axiomatization of all possible pictures, which is really clarifying. It's also good preparation for Schubert calculus: If you consider the case where your ground ring is a field, this is the recipe to assign a permutation to a pair of complete flags.

Could I make a notational suggestion? You call your modules M_i, M'_j and M_{i,j}. If you called them X_i, Y_j and Z_{i,j}, not only would they be more visually distinctive, but you could make it mnemonic -- X_i on the x-axis and Y_j on the y-axis. This would be particularly nice because you use the variables i, i', j and j' later, and it surprised me that i and i' went with M while j and j' go with M'.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The news that Arif Ahmed is to be appointed the UK’s first ‘Free Speech Tsar’ — a position that apparently comes with “the power to investigate universities and student unions in England and Wales that wrongly restrict debate” and to “advise the sector regulator on imposing fines for free speech breaches” — is disappointing for various reasons. One of them (not the most important one) is that it suggests Britain’s capacity to name things continues to decline. To see this once-great country reach for a foreign title that not only originates with one second-rate empire trying to recall the glory of the Romans but that was first popularized as a job-title within the administrative apparatus of another is really quite sad, given that England has so many equally preposterous but largely home-grown (or at least Norman French) titles available right on its own doorstep. It’s a scandal, really. A kind of Tsargate, if you will.
Here I present a few alternatives of my own, along with some excellent suggestions from others following up with me about this on social media. As an alternative to “Free Speech Tsar”, consider one or more of the following: The Duke of Discourse. Warden of All Chit-Chat. Equerry of Arguments. Gold Stick To The Point. The Earl of Axiom. The Keeper of the King’s Premises. The Wheedle Beadle. Chief Constable Counterexample. The Postillion of Positing. The Justiciar of Just One More Thing. The Marquess of My Question is More of a Comment. The Archbishop of Banterbury. The Lord Privy Sealion. Groom of the Discourse. Chancellor of the Factchequer. Red Herring Pursuivant. Master of the Eyerolls.
As should be clear, the capacity exists within the UK to develop an entire peerage system of Free Speech aristocrats of all ranks. I strongly encourage Rishi Sunak to implement just such a scheme as soon as is practicable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 4.2-1 of the survey package has hit CRAN! There are three major changes.
First, when you ask for influence functions for an estimate, in order to get comparisons between subpopulations or something, you get an influence function for each record in the dataset – if there are missing values, the influence function is zero (a bit like the way na.exclude works).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The benefits of your Zettelkasten highly depend on the longevity of each note. Since the Zettelkasten as life-long companion and comrade in the battle for and against knowledge is a long-term endeavor, it is crucial that you create notes and structures that will last a long time. The minimum goal should be that they last a lifetime, so they are optimally designed for yourself. Ideally, they last forever, so future generations can benefit from your work as well.
One of the major benefits of the Zettelkasten is that you can transcend time to a degree. You can connect your current ideas with thoughts that you have had or read about 20 years ago.
