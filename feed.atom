        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tennessee may be largely whiskey territory, but in recent years, a small number of local producers have been concentrating on a far more ancient elixir: mead. In 2019, Ross Welbon, a beer brewer and beekeeper, and Dru Sousan, a bartender with a long history in the local restaurant scene, opened up Nashville’s first meadery.

All of the meads here come from Honeytree Meadery’s own apiary, which is spread across two locations holding more than 30 bee colonies. Each glass contains notes of the honey used to produce it—from a milder wildflower to fragrant orange blossom—while some contain custom infusions of aromatics such as fresh ginger or pineapple and sage. Welbon, ever the IPA-enthusiast, adds his own flair with a dry-hopped variation.

As a bonus, the meadery has one of the best backyard patios in town, complete with a roaring fire and beeswax artworks by Randy Purcell. It’s the perfect spot to kick back with an order of tacos from Alebrije, the truck perpetually parked outside. Named for a Mexican cryptid, the business is the creation of chef Edgar Victoria, who hails from Mexico City. Victoria sources masa from small-scale producers for his tlayudas, huaraches, and tortillas. Check their Instagram to keep an eye out for specials, like tamales made with blue conico corn masa.]]></summary>

On the lower floor of the Penn Museum, down an elevator beside the café and through two locked doors, her lab’s shelves are stacked with the skeletal remains of everything from llamas and cattle to pigs, fish, and guinea pigs.

This isn’t just any cabinet of curiosities: It’s the Center for the Analysis of Archaeological Materials (CAAM), and its osteological library is a key tool in Moore’s mission to unpack our historical eating habits.

“Look at that rough break,” she says, holding up a cow’s tibia from the 18th century. “That shows that this animal has been butchered and prepared for meat in a very informal, non-market-based way.” She notes that bones from later centuries often sport cleaner cuts, showing that the meat was sawn car…]]></summary>

There’s a comfortable rhythm to the evening: guests stagger in roughly an hour before service to sip bourbon-spiked Fruit Tea Punch in a chandelier- and velvet-bedecked parlor. 

Gradually, everyone takes their seats in the main dining room, where Surti holds court over an open kitchen. Over the next couple of hours, a procession of eight to 10 dishes emerge, each accompanied by a short introductory story by Surti. As guests nibble on, say, a dish of chevdo, a chaat-like snack mixture with peanuts and roasted chickpeas, he’ll explain how his mother used to pack bags of the stuff for family road trips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situated a safe distance from the freewheeling mania of Broadway, Nashville’s honky tonk ground zero, Santa’s Pub is blissfully free from bachelorettes and bullshit. The owner, nicknamed “Santa” for his Kris Kringle-worthy beard, is something of an icon around these parts. 

Gussied up with Christmas lights, North Pole-centric paraphernalia, and a decade’s worth of Sharpie bathroom stall graffiti, this converted double-wide trailer is a dive bar stripped down to its essence. Don’t even think about asking for a cocktail—the bartenders stick to dirt-cheap beers, which suits everyone just fine. You’re not here for fussy drinks; you’re here for the vibes. 

Santa’s Pub is the type of watering hole where just about everyone is a regular—and those that aren’t will feel like it after an hour or two. The crowd is a mix of crusty old-timers, twentysomethings downing PBRs, and warmly welcomed travelers. 

On any given night, half the room is probably in a band—a fact that comes in handy when it’s karaoke time. Expect to hear some killer country music covers, all without paying a cover charge. If you plan on taking your turn at the mic, know that Santa takes the stage rules seriously: “No Beer, No Cussin', and No Cigarettes on Santa's stage!” Sing a song that’s too vulgar and expect to be booted off.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perched at what feels like the gateway to East Nashville, this diminutive house of pain provides hot chicken–seekers with a spice challenge they won't soon forget. The interior is simple, with nostalgic flare and additional seating out back. The menu is equally spartan, sticking to a succinct list of bone-in poultry parts, along with both catfish and whiting filets, all flawlessly seasoned and fried to an audible crunch. 

While Nashville has no shortage of restaurants serving excellent renditions of its famous chicken, Bolton's has a particularly storied legacy. Bolton Matthews, who co-founded the restaurant with his wife Dolly in 1997, was the nephew of hot chicken legend Bolton Polk, who worked his way up through the kitchens at Prince's Hot Chicken Shack. Before he passed away, Polk left his secret recipe to Matthews.

In an oral history interview with Southern Foodways Alliance, Dolly said of customers demanding their chicken, “They were banging on the door... Says it gives them a rush. They can breathe better. They can function better at work because they’re more alert.” 

It’s easy to see how one bite will wake you up. A word to the wise: imagine spice levels here running large. As in, mild is really medium—so on and so forth. Don't try to be a hero when you order or you'll end up crying in front of every diner in the restaurant.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first Anglican church in (then) Bombay, the St Thomas Cathedral is the historic center of Mumbai. While it was built in December 1718, it was finally consecrated as a cathedral only in 1837.

The St Thomas Cathedral is recognized as the "Zero Point" of the city of Bombay, as distances along all major roads were measured from here. Of the original 16 markers, 11 are still found in their original location (though broken or dilapidated), and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) restored all 16 in 2022.

One of the city's major railways and the headquarters of the Western Railways of India, the Churchgate railway station was named after the old gate, which directly led to the St Thomas Cathedral. Demolished in 1860, the gate was one of three that fortified the city of Bombay. It wasn't until a decade later in 1870 that Churchgate was declared a station.

The church is dotted with epitaphs for martyred soldiers and a prominent memorial for the first Bishop of Bombay, the Right Reverend Thomas Carr, and is populated with multiple stained glass windows designed by Victorian artists from England.]]></summary>

These are both over a hundred years old and are two of the city’s oldest remaining buildings. One is a Korean restaurant and the other is the Ulaanbaatar City Museum. 

This small but charming museum showcases Ulaanbaatar’s history from a nomadic encampment to a modern metropolis. Previously known as Urga and Ikh Khuree, the communist-led government gave the name Ulaanbaatar, or “red hero,” to honor Mongolian revolutionary leader Sukhbaatar. 

Exhibits include historic maps, paintings, artwork, and photos depicting Ulaanbaatar’s history from the past to the present. There are even Lego replicas of city landmarks. Toward the exit is a life-sized cardboard cutout of Öndör Gongor, the famous two-meter-tall giant.]]></summary>

Like most international borders, Turkey’s are the result of geopolitical accident, not of aesthetic or geometric design. A more pertinent query: How rectangular is Turkey? Is it, perhaps, the most rectangular country in the world?

To answer that question, you’d have to find a dataset that minutely describes the borders of all countries on Earth and devise an algorithm that compares each country’s shape to an optimum rectangle with the same area.

That’s exactly what Australian geo-statistician David Barry did. His conclusion: Turkey is only the 15th most rectangular country in the world. The winner: Egypt.

Some look to the stars on June 24, the day in 1947 when a pilot claimed to see "flying saucers" over Mount Rainier, while others await first contact on July 2, the day that same year when something crashed in the New Mexico desert near Roswell. But for those who believe the truth is out there, the goal is the same: to raise awareness that humans may not be alone in the universe. To mark World UFO Day 2023, we explored the Atlas Obscura archive for stories of science, mystery, and why we are obsessed with the unexplained.

Originally, the path was used by migratory elands, elephants, and the indigenous Khoi people, who called it T'kanna Ouwe or Gantouw.

The English explorer, author, and artist Thomas Baines first traveled to South Africa in the 1840s. In one of his later accounts of traveling through the country, he described this pass. "At the first part of it, the road is not very steep," he wrote, "but as soon as the traveller enters the hollow way of the Roode Hoogte (the Red Heights) the difficulty of the ascent begins." He described the "barren, reddish, clayey, ferruginous earth" and the

Not long after its opening, the Monte Sano Hotel became one of the top spas in the nation with registered guests including some famous names like the Vanderbilt family, William Waldorf Astor, Helen Keller, and Jay Gould. While operating it was known as the epitome of class and extravagance in Huntsville. It closed in 1900 but reopened in 1917 before closing once again and being torn down for salvage in 1944.

All that remains of the hotel is the brick chimney with little to show of the extravagance of its heyday.]]></summary>

From Degthai, which serves fiery tom yum noodles that would feel right at home in Bangkok, to killer tamales, sopes, and more at Tacos Y Mariscos El Amigo, the options verge on overwhelming. One fan favorite that never fails is Edessa’s, which packs in regulars nightly despite its strip mall parking lot digs, thanks to ample portions of Kurdish and Turkish dishes.

Co-owner Mesut Kelik is just one of more than 15,000 expats who make up Nashville’s Kurdish diaspora community—one of the largest in the world. For centuries, the Kurds have existed across the borders of multiple nations, a cultural and geographic diversity reflected in their cuisine. Edessa is named in honor of an ancient Mesopotamian city in what is now Turkey, where Armenian, Arab, Kurdish, and Turkish peoples all coexisted. 

Everything on the expansive menu here is made and presented with care, from the clay pot kebab, a sumptuously seasoned lamb stew poured tableside from an earthen vessel, to the su boregi, a many-layered appetizer of generously buttered, whisper-thin dough oozing molten cheese. The spoon-tender lamb shank is a particular highlight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes of green cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves hit your palate first, balanced by a restrained sweetness. Made with impeccably steeped black leaf tea, The Horn's chai is to the sugary chai mix served at many American cafes what a Milanese master barista's espresso pull is to the free, stale drip coffee you might find in an office. And while we can't fully condone the playful sign on the wall declaring this, “The only Chai that matters in Nashville,” it is a cut above.

The Horn has offered Nashville’s thriving community of more than 3,000 Somali refugees a taste of home since 2014, when Hassan Rasul opened the café with his sons, Ahmed and Zakariya. Each morning, the Rasuls lay out an assortment of sweet and savory treats, including malawah (lacy crepes), nafaqo (crispy mashed potato patties stuffed with egg), and mandazi (fried puff pastry).

The real stars here are the sambusas, the Somali cousins of samosas, which come fried to a pillowy crunch. You can't go wrong with the expertly seasoned traditional beef or veggie fillings. That said, the Rasuls also offer a rotating selection of Deep Southern riffs, including a Nashville hot chicken–inspired number and a “Smokin’ BBQ Chicken.” Most unexpectedly delightful of all might be the “Cheesy Breakfast” option, which tucks an egg-and-cheese into a flaky triangular pocket.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The watchful eyes of Dolly Parton preside over the disco ball-bedecked interior of East Nashville’s oldest dive bar. Her face, drawn, collaged, and printed in Mattel-pink is everywhere between the graffiti-plastered walls and under the strings of Christmas tree lights. One especially large cardboard cutout, a gift from local artist Brett Douglas Hunter, has been repeatedly stolen and returned with great drama to the bar.

Dino’s, which has been serving cheap beers and bourbons until the hazy late-late hours of the night since the 1970s, feels like a timewarp, even if it’s had a few subtle, behind-the scenes touch-ups over years. 

In 2015, Nashville restaurant duo Miranda Whitcomb Pontes and Alex Wendkos stepped in to run the joint. Luckily, the pair knew what made Dino’s so special in the first place and chose not to mess with it too much. The vibes remain impeccable and the cheeseburger is as good as when Anthony Bourdain dug it. Order yours “Animal Style,” with plenty of mustard, pickles, sauce, and onions, plus a fried egg or bacon, if you’re feeling it. Don’t skip the fries.


Like any great dive, Dino’s hits best long after its competition calls it a night. Come hang with other East Nashville industry types getting off their shifts until 3 a.m. seven nights a week. Or if you prefer to drink under the harsh light of day, stop by Dolly’s Lemonade Stand, a giant lemon crowned by a sculptural rendition of the country diva, that serves as a satellite bar Thursday through Saturday. 

In 2022, not long after her namesake lemonade stand opened, Parton herself swung by. She left a signed photograph that says, “Dino’s, I will always love you. Love, Dolly.”]]></summary>

Mann was born on May 4, 1796, in Franklin, Massachusetts, to a relatively poor farming family. As a teenager, he usually received no more than six weeks of schooling per year. However, he made extensive use of the Franklin Public Library, the oldest in the nation, and enrolled in Brown University graduating in three years in 1819 as a valedictorian. He practiced and studied law in the area and was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature in 1827.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crescent Mill was probably the earliest mining infrastructure built in this part of Nevada, in the late 1860s. It was possibly located here due to water availability from Crescent Spring, and this spring still fills a water tank at the site.

The mill was intended to process ore from local silver strikes, but it initially shut down in 1867 after only 10 days of operation. With new financial backing, it re-opened and ran from 1869 to 1871, with some desultory activity thereafter, but as was so often the case the grade and volume of ore was inadequate to repay the investment.

The most prominent remnant is the chimney for the smelter, but there are fragments of other ruins in the vicinity. The area now lies at the extreme southwestern corner of Basin and Range National Monument. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.]]></summary>

But if you look closely, you will see people, not roller coaster cars, traversing the tracks in this park. In fact, Pohang's Space Walk was designed to be enjoyed on foot.

Korea's largest walkable art installation began development in 2019 by Pohang's city government in partnership with two German artists, Heiki Mutter and Ulrich Genth. Visitors brave enough to traverse the 717 steps will be treated to spectacular views of Youngil Bay and Youngildae Beach.

But Pohang's seaside location is not the only feature that makes it the perfect home for the Space Walk. POSCO, Korea's largest steel manufacturer, is headquartered in Pohang, where the 317 tons of steel used in this art piece were produced. The Space Walk is expected to become a permanent feature of Pohang's skyline as a special nod to the impressive steel manufacturing that takes place in the city.]]></summary>

Designated as Pennsylvania’s “most historic bridge” in 1938, it is also registered on the National Register of Historic Places. Built by David Stoner for $1,544, this 100-foot long and 15-foot wide bridge crosses over Marsh Creek and is a beautiful place for a walk and picnic (and it may even be haunted).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The National Blue Army Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima is nestled away on 150 acres of scenic farmland in New Jersey. It was built in 1978 and is dedicated to the message of Fatima, reportedly delivered directly from the Mother of God to three Portuguese children in 1917.

The Blue Army was founded in 1946 by Harold Colgan, a parish priest of St Mary in Plainfield, New Jersey. Colgan had fallen critically ill and was hospitalized. In the hospital, he prayed to Our Lady of Fatima that if she cured him, he would spend the rest of his life spreading devotion to her. Colgan recovered and began preaching about the Virgin Mary shortly after.

Towering 130 feet above the shrine is a bronze statue of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, with the roof representing her mantle flowing over and protecting her children. Sister Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, the last survivor of the original three children that the vision of Our Lady of Fatima was brought in as a consultant on the shrine.

There are many bronze statues dotting the grounds. Including an exact replica of the Chapel of Apparitions at Fatima, one of few such replicas in the world.

There is plenty of parking and please be respectful of the grounds.]]></summary>

You probably haven’t ever heard of the small city of Visoko in Bosnia. I certainly hadn’t until I started writing this book. For a long time it was a place that rarely popped up in international news. And even when it did, it usually only concerned one local resident, Adnan Nević, who became notable for being recognized by the United Nations as Earth’s official sixth-billionth human. Otherwise, it never really made much of a dent in global news coverage. Fortunes changed for the city in 2020, however, when Novak Djokovic, at the time the world’s top-ranked tennis player, started making pilgrimages there so h…]]></summary>

By locating the direction where the signal was largest, he discovered that it came from the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

With this first measurement, the field of radio astronomy came into existence. The name "Jansky" was given to the unit of radio flux density.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Đi ăn nhậu tối nay không?” is a phrase you’ll hear often throughout Vietnam. In literal terms, it translates to “let’s go eat and drink tonight,” but the use of the word nhậu evokes something deeper. To nhậu is to come together over plentiful food, typically eaten with your hands, and drink, typically generous amounts of beer. It’s the quintessential act of daily celebration, for no reason at all, that often lasts for hours and sometimes includes spontaneous sidewalk karaoke. 

This is the ritual on display at Nhớ Tuyết, which literally means “missing or remembering snow,” though it’s really named after the owner, whose name is Tuyết. Come as the locals do: with a big group of friends. And enjoy a vast selection of seafood ranging from clams in lemongrass broth, to scallops topped with scallion oil and crushed peanuts, to colossal river prawns all cooked via your preferred preparation, whether that’s salt-toasted or tossed in a wok with tamarind sauce. 

Beyond the seafood, Ms. Tuyết is known for her proprietary recipe for pâté, which comes in a thinner-than-usual texture with a sheet of burnt rice for scooping up as sort of a dip. There are also plenty of options for vegetarian diners, including an off-menu tofu in salted egg sauce. Your meal here will typically come with a full case of beer. At the end of the meal, they’ll count how many cans are left and charge accordingly.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first thing you encounter when you stumble on Bún Riêu Gánh is the colossal pot of red-orange crab broth simmering right there on the sidewalk. The name of the venue alludes to the gánh, or a wooden yoke traditionally used by street vendors to carry their goods, to which the pot is attached. From this pot, brimming with seafood and herbs, the shop’s owner, Mrs. Mai Thi Lien, ladles each bowl to order. 

A four-decade-old mainstay located near the bustling Ben Thanh Market, the restaurant’s namesake noodle soup, bún riêu, combines rice vermicelli noodles, or bún, with riêu, or a crab paste which is typically combined with pork, shrimp, and prawns to create a solid, meatloaf-like consistency. Also in the bowl are heaping chunks of tofu as well as huyet, or coagulated pork blood, while a side plate of herbs includes perilla leaves and basil. 

Though the dish is believed to have originated in northern Vietnam, it’s become one of the most popular noodle soups throughout the entire country. Here, Mrs. Lien serves her bún riêu with an accompanying dipping cup of tamarind fish sauce with sliced chili and pure shrimp paste. The use of tamarind is distinctly southern: twirl up the noodles with a piece of crab paste and dip it all into the sauce for a pop of tangy brightness.]]></summary>

During a trip through Europe in 2015, he snapped tons of photos with a pocket camera. But when he got home, he was disappointed. Nothing he’d captured did the trip justice: His photos were crooked, dark, or taken without a thought for composition.

He started watching YouTube photography videos, upgraded his camera, and practiced relentlessly. His skills grew quickly, and so did his sense of fulfillment. In 2018, he quit his job to become a digital nomad and pursue photography full-time, capturing the Milky Way and other natural wonders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Vietnamese food debates usually revolve around whose pho is best, there’s also a fair amount of polarizing discourse surrounding cơm tấm, or broken rice, as everyone feels strongly about their favorite rendition. 

Perhaps best described as an everyday meal of the people, this culturally significant dish is centered around its most humble ingredient, the rice. During the brutal French colonial period, a time of hunger in Vietnamese history, people began cooking with the rice that had been broken during the milling process. As such, it’s become a symbol of Vietnamese resilience and resourcefulness. 

This is the origin of cơm tấm, which is the namesake dish at Cơm Tấm Nguyễn Văn Cừ, a beloved institution that’s been selling it since 1968. The rendition here is traditional: a couple scoops of the broken rice along with sides of sườn nướng (marinated pork chop), bì (shredded pork skin), chả trứng (egg and meat loaf) along with pickled vegetables. Fish sauce, with or without birdseye chili, is poured over the top and adds depth of flavor. 

The big differentiator here is the larger-than-typical size of pork chop, which is prepared on the grill out in front of the nondescript storefront. It comes with a higher price tag (a little less than $7), of course, and while that’s earned it some detractors, it nevertheless remains packed for lunch daily with a mostly local audience.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the bustling city of Gwangju in South Korea's southwestern corner, tucked away in the city's historic Yangnim-dong neighborhood, a traditional Korean home boasts rare architecture in a calming atmosphere. Known as a hanok, the home was first constructed in 1899. The wealthy landowner, Jeong Nak-Gyo, and his family commissioned the house and were the first to live in it. 

Throughout the Japanese colonial period in South Korea from 1910-1945, many similar homes with Korean architecture were destroyed. This house adopted a Japanese-style garden during this time period but was able to maintain its distinctive Korean buildings.

The home was later purchased by its most famous resident, Lee Jang-Woo, in 1959. Lee was a prominent philanthropist and education advocate for the Jeolla region. Along with his legacy of founding kindergartens, middle schools, high schools, and universities across Jeolla, he has also left behind this remarkable architectural site for visitors today to enjoy. Under Lee's care, additions were made to the house including men's quarters, servants' quarters, and a storehouse, all in keeping with the traditional Korean style.

The Japanese-style garden was converted back to a Korean-style garden in 2009 for the Gwangju Design Biennale. The original women's quarters and gates built by Nak-Gyo are also still intact.]]></summary>

The park also highlights the practical applications of plants in sustainable technologies.

One of the pieces of equipment on view is an algae-based photobioreactor near the park's entrance. In the device, a series of tubes cultivates algae that can be used in everything from power generation to carbon sequestration.

“I knew my mom was going to kill me,” recalls Pittas. “So my friend told me, you should pray to Agios Fanourious. And I was like, who?”

This was the first time Pittas had heard of St. Fanourious, the Greek patron saint of lost things. She spent the next week praying fervently. “I happened to be in the kitchen at church, and I went into a cabinet to get something. And there was the Bible, waiting for me,” she remembers. “I don’t even know why it would be in there! Or why I would have gone into this cabinet at all."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set within a narrow wet market on Tôn Thất Đạm street, Ănăn (literally “eat, eat”) is a casual fine dining Vietnamese restaurant that combines traditional flavors and ingredients with modern techniques in creative, whimsical dishes. Opened in 2017, it’s the brainchild of chef Peter Cuong Franklin, a chef-auteur who traded in a career in investment banking for life in a kitchen, earning acclaim at Hong Kong’s Chôm Chôm before moving back to Vietnam, a country he once fled as a young refugee. 

Franklin calls his cooking “new Vietnamese” cuisine, riffing off the “new American” and “new Scandinavian” food movements that have taken off in the west. At Ănăn—Ho Chi Minh City’s first Michelin star restaurant—his freewheeling approach is evident in dishes like the Da Lat Pizza, a twist on an open-faced rice paper street food from Franklin’s hometown of Da Lat, and the Banh Xeo Taco with beef, reimagining Vietnamese crispy crepes in a hand-held format with meat cooked in Vietnamese bo kho (beef stew) seasoning. 

There’s more to love than just the food. The restaurant spreads out across five levels of seating including a charming rooftop deck offering sweeping views of the District 1 neighborhood. Located on the third floor, the on-site cocktail bar Nhau Nhau (“drink, drink”) turns out specialty drinks like a Phojito—a mojito infused with classic pho spices like star anise and cinnamon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dedicated to the history of medicine and its transmission in the city of Toulouse, this museum houses a collection of instruments, paintings, and documents covering seven centuries of local and global history. With the Museum of Medical Devices, it shares a wing of the Hôtel Saint Jacques, a former hospital active since the 1100s with impressive architecture overlooking the river Garonne.

The museum was founded in 1983 by Pr. Jean-Charles Auvergnat, who wanted to give the public an overview of the historical, scientific, technical, and artistic sides of medicine. The basement is dedicated to the history of the faculty of Toulouse, and how it was taught to students through the years. At the same time, the upper level showcases a former pharmacy with beautiful woodwork from the 19th century. The alliance of majestic architecture and high ceilings with old-fashioned museography gives a certain charm to the museum.

There are several rare and surprising pieces, such as face moldings showcasing skin diseases, an 18th-century oil painting of a patient suffering from a gigantic hernia, and an abortion table from the Napoleonic era.]]></summary>

A product of French colonialism, coffee is widely consumed by Vietnamese people, who congregate at the dozens of cafes on every city corner to re-energize, reconnect, and take respite from the heat. It’s a part of Vietnamese culture to take one’s time over coffee, which is brewed via a single-serving, slow-drip metal filter called a phin. 

A small roaster with two locations in Saigon (one in District 1 and one in District 2), Hue Cafe offers all the classic styles of Vietnamese coffee: black, with condensed milk, blended with coconut and ice. But the standout is salt coffee, a specialty from the cafe’s namesake, Hue, the former imperial capital located in central Vietnam. The drink involves whipping cream into a salty fluff to accentuate the natural sweetness of the coffee. 

Simple pleasure and relaxation is the essence of Hue Cafe, whose best location is on the shady, tree-lined strip of Xuân Thủy in the expat area of District 2. Order your coffee and enjoy it outside where all the regulars gather around on plastic stools and watch the bikes go by.]]></summary>

Construction began in 1924, and was completed in 1929. At the time of its opening, it was the tallest building in Latin America, and the largest concrete-framed building in the world. Although today it seems modest when compared to other huge buildings in the capital, the building designed by Italian businessman Giuseppe Martinelli carries with it tons of history and various curiosities.

The news of the construction of the tallest building in the city brought terror to the people of São Paulo at the time. Still accustomed to smaller buildings, with up to four floors, residents of the region feared that the construction…]]></summary>

Chinese mitten crabs are a delicacy among some seafood lovers: deeply savory, with a distinctive tinge of sweetness. Diners crack the shells open and eat the meat piping hot, dipped in rice vinegar and soy sauce with sliced ginger. The unique flavor of the crabs, most of which are grown in farms on China’s Yangtze River, is crucial to their popularity. When it comes to seafood, research shows that consumers prioritize taste above all else—including health benefits and environmental sustainability.

In the lobby, glass panels line a wall, each highlighting a significant achievement in food-production history, from the advent of deep-frying to the invention of canning to the development of pasteurization. This timeline is a good introduction for what lies farther inside: a company that’s creating 3-D printed foods.

The two-time Democrat Senator for Minnesota was on the campaign trail, and was due to appear in Duluth that evening for a debate, but made a detour to Eleventh to attend the funeral of Martin Rukavina, a steelworker whose son Tom, served in the Minnesota House of Representatives.   

The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, the fiery senator was described by The Economist as the soul of the Democratic Party, fighting for progressive causes, no matter the odds. Despite his leftist populist leanings, Wellstone garnered respect and admiration from bot…]]></summary>

No wonder the mansion became famous for being haunted, inspiring legends, and terrifying local children. It’s Casa de Dona Yayá, the house arrest of an orphan with a tragic fate.

A residence where important clans from São Paulo's past passed, the house had the traditional Melo Freire family as its last residents: the politician and farmer Manuel de Almeida Melo Freire, coming from Mogi das Cruzes, moved there in 1921 with his wife and four children. And it didn't take long for serial misfortunes to happen under that roof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Model Trains Station in Taylors, South Carolina, is indeed a unique destination. They are located in a restored industrial park and to begin with, it is a spectacular place, the restoration is gorgeous. It's noticeably industrial but fully functional as a mixed-use space with restaurants, event spaces, and more.

They feature over a dozen full displays of miniature train layouts. You could honestly spend days peering at these tiny worlds, seeing new things every time you look. There are hidden bits and little jokes in every display. It's extremely kid friendly, they even have several interactive setups specifically for children to operate. They also have a party room where they host birthday parties.

Speaking of setups to operate, getting to play with the trains is not just for kids. They have dozens of spots where you can interact with the displays and even operate the trains themselves. There is an in-house repair shop and watching volunteers repair the trains is as interesting as the displays themselves.

The volunteers are so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the various displays and will take you all around pointing things out and telling you about the history of the place and the trains. They will give you as much or as little of a guided tour as you wish.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On 27 acres along US Route 2 west of Bangor, you will find Camp Etna, home to the Etna Spiritualist Association.  It has been an American gathering center for mediums, healers, and others for close to 170 years.

American spiritualism emerged in the late 1800s. Some early practitioners were proven as frauds, but the movement grew in the American Northeast. Records of meetings officially begin in 1876 but the camp’s history dates back to the 1840s. By 1876 spiritualists would arrive every summer for meetings and lectures from the leading thinkers of the day, with an entry fee of ten cents a day. The camp was born as some attendees put down firmer roots. The peak of the camp was in the early 1900s, with more than 130 cottages, with thousands attending summer camp activities. 

The Etna Spiritualist Association was born in September 1919. The camp also was involved early in the women’s rights/feminist movement, with female camp members visible in many issues.

Prominent visitors have included Harrison D. Barrett, the first president of the U.S. National Spiritualist Association, and U.S. Senator Margaret Chase Smith. The camp was given a Maine Governor’s Day proclamation in 1911. 

In the camp, there is a large memorial stone for Mary S. Vanderbilt, who died in 1911. Her grave and headstone are in Barrett Square. Mary Drake Jenne worked with them from 1902 until Harrison passed to spirit in 1911 and Mary Vanderbilt in 1919. Mary Drake Jenne continued to be a worker for Spiritualism until her death in 1946.

Visitors are welcome to park, explore, and even take the short downhill walk to Etna Pond to the north. There are many cottages throughout the camp, approximately 50, in various states of repair, centered around the camp green.

In order to stand out from its competitors, a Walk of Fame was installed inside. Some peculiar prints are to be found here, boxer Julio César Chávez left his right fist, for example. A TV presenter known mononymously as Facundo, famous for his provocative, often controversial gonzo reporting style, left one hand doing the ILY sign, while the other raises its middle finger. These make a fair amount of sense, but there are some that require more explanation.

The subject had been taught in Edinburgh since 1583, and in 1818, Playfair Observatory was built on Carlton Hill by the Astronomical Institution of Edinburgh. King George IV was sufficiently impressed with astronomy in Scotland that, when he visited in 1822, he designated Carlton Hill as the Royal Observatory. The first Astronomer Royal for Scotland, who managed the observatory, was Thomas Henderson. Appointed in 1834, Henderson was also known for being the first astronomer to measure the distances to stars using parallax (the slight shifting of the position of nearby stars relative to background stars seen when the Earth was in different locations in its orbit).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone who has studied the assassination of President Lincoln or understands the background of the phrase “His name is mud (Mudd)” will understand the irony of this bench which is located across from the house where President Lincoln stayed before the Gettysburg Address.

In 1865, Samuel Alexander Mudd Sr. was an American physician imprisoned for conspiring with John Wilkes Booth in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.

“His name is mud.” is spoken of one regarded unfavorably and inaccurately associated with the 1865 Dr. Samuel Mudd, who treated John Wilkes Booth after Booth shot Lincoln.

But the good news is while the initial thought might be “How inappropriate!”, this bench was actually placed with noble intentions to honor Gettysburg resident Samuel A. Mudd, who passed away in 2006. A member of the St. James Lutheran Church in Gettysburg, he was very involved with community service at the neighborhood, borough, and county levels.

In 2006, Dr. Mudd was awarded the John Andrews Memorial Award for Community Service by Main Street Gettysburg. He was a founder of  From the Ground Up, a group of dedicated volunteers who collect litter throughout the borough. He was also one of the founders of the Hazel Alley Residents Association, a group dedicated to working with Gettysburg College students living off campus to create a safer, more cooperative, neighborhood. Dr. Mudd also contributed his time to the Seeds to Success program run by SCCAP. He served for many years on the Borough's Planning Commission.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<div type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>About two years ago I wrote  entitled “A Return”, upon moving to Princeton for a year (I was a Presidential Visiting Scholar at the Physics department). I reflected upon the fact that it was a return to a significant place from my past, where I’d been transformed in so many ways. Princeton was the first place I visited (not counting airports) in the USA, the location of my first postdoctoral appointment (at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS)), and its was there that I did a deep enriching dive into the hubbub of Theoretical Physics, at one of the very top places in the world to do so.<a href="https://asymptotia.com/2021/08/26/a-return-4/">a post</a></p><p>After that, I moved West, to Santa Barbara, where my next postdoc position was at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), now called the KITP. I was very lucky to be able to go from one top place to another, and (as I’ve recently talked about in a BBC interview ) additionally, my field was in a delicious turmoil of activity and discovery. I was able to be a part of the maelstrom (the “Second Superstring Revolution”, and all the gifts it gave us, including better understanding of the role in quantum gravity of extended objects beyond strings (such as D-branes), the physics of quantum black holes, the tools to unlock the holographic nature of quantum gravity more generally (through AdS/CFT), and so on. (I've blogged about many of these topics here, so use the search tool for more.)<a href="http://asymptotia.com/wp-images/2023/06/SB_coast-scaled.jpg"><img alt="Coastal view from UCSB campus" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-20071" height="223" src="http://asymptotia.com/wp-images/2023/06/SB_coast-300x223.jpg" width="300"/></a><a href="https://asymptotia.com/2023/02/03/the-life-scientific-interview/">here</a></p><p>I’ve been known to say that Princeton was the place where I found my physics voice (Edward Witten was a key guide at that time). Well, to continue the theme, Santa Barbara (with its wonderful research group made up of people from both the KITP and the wider Physics Department) was the place where I started to learn how to use that voice to sing (with the guidance of Joe Polchinski (who sadly passed away a few years ago)).</p><p>Well, as you may be guessing after that long introduction, I’m doing “A Return” again, but this time not with some boxes and suitcases of things for a year’s stay: I can now announce that I’ll be leaving the University of Southern California (USC) and (as of 1st July 2023) joining [...] <a class="continue-reading-link" href="https://asymptotia.com/2023/06/25/a-return-again/"> Click to continue reading this post <span class="meta-nav">→ </span></a></p><p>The post  appeared first on .<a href="https://asymptotia.com/2023/06/25/a-return-again/" rel="nofollow">A Return (Again)</a><a href="https://asymptotia.com" rel="nofollow">Asymptotia</a></p></div></div>]]></summary>

Accompanied by over 600 Barbies, Lego, and train sets, it will elicit a feeling of shock and awe from the visitors.

If not though the sheer size of the day toy collection or the fringe memorabilia of movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Nightmare Before Christmas; the fascinating background stories and anecdotes delivered with humor by the owner will definitely deliver.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Oil was first discovered in southwestern Ontario in 1857 and is being pumped from the ground to this day. That pre-dates discoveries in Alberta by more than 50 years.  

James Miller Williams the father of the petroleum industry in Canada, established the first commercially successful oil well in 1858 and igniting the first oil boom in North America. (Take that J.R. Ewing!)

The Oil Museum of Canada is located on land that was designated as the First Commercial Oil Field National Historic Site of Canada in 1925.  The museum itself was opened to the public in July 1960. On site, you can see the small pumpjacks toiling away.  Locals may refer to them as a donkey pumper, nodding donkey, pumping unit, horsehead pump, rocking horse, beam pump, dinosaur, sucker rod pump, grasshopper pump,  or jack pump.

You will certainly get a whiff of the oil smell now and then....and some other smells as the site is located in a delightfully rural location.]]></summary>

The name comes from the fact the Border Reivers of the Johnstone Clan once hid stolen cattle in this hollow. These Reivers were referred to by their enemies as "devils."

The area is beautiful, giving views over the valley below, made all the more atmospheric when the cloud is low and the weather is gloomy.  At these times you can almost imagine the moos of the hidden cattle in the valley below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On any given day, visitors to the Tower of London can vary from several hundred to well into the thousands. Many come seeking to get a glimpse of the Crown Jewels or perhaps they desire to witness the location of where executions took place firsthand. What the latter may not be aware of, is the vast majority of public executions took place outside the walls of the tower, just a few yards away, on a grassy knoll near Tower Hill Underground Station.

Less than two dozen individuals met their maker at the end of the executioner's axe on Tower Green. These included the two wives of King Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and Catherine Howard, as well as Lady Jane Grey, who was Queen of England for only nine days. As compared to the estimated 125 mortals who lost their lives across the road on Tower Hill. The disparity in numbers is because executions at the Tower of London were reserved for individuals of high rank or who possessed popular support.

At the western edge of a green space known as Trinity Square Gardens, a scaffold was erected from the 15th century to dispatch of individuals who held an air of status and were found guilty of high treason or other offenses against the crown. It operated for nearly four hundred years, with the last public execution taking place in 1747, that of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, a supporter of the Stuart family's right to the throne.

Today, visitors can find a small cordoned-off area, just to the left of the Grade I-listed Merchant Navy Memorial, First World War Section. Here, you'll find a list of names, beginning in 1381 and ending in the mid-1700s. These include participants in the following rebellions: Peasants' Revolt, War of the Roses, English Reformation, as well as the Jacobite Uprising. Thousands of eager onlookers would gather to witness these public displays of execution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Magnesium-bearing deposits (magnesite, or magnesium carbonate, and brucite, or magnesium hydroxide) were discovered here in the late 1920s. The minerals are used in making refractory (high-temperature) ceramics and in chemical manufacturing, notably Epsom salts. It was a quiet niche market.

Then came World War II. High-performance aircraft were critical to the war effort, and magnesium was a key component of light, high-strength aircraft alloys. It was feared that the Axis powers were way ahead in magnesium technology. Hence a crash program for magnesium production was initiated, and it used these magnesium minerals as ore.

The raw ore minerals were shipped to a newly opened plant in Henderson, Nevada, just outside Las Vegas, for processing into magnesium metal. Hydropower was available from the newly-finished Hoover Dam, as the electrolytic process for magnesium separation requires a great deal of electricity. It's analogous to aluminum in that respect.

The shipping route was very circuitous as there was no direct rail link. The ore was first trucked to a railhead at Luning, Nevada, some 32 miles west (the rails have since been torn up). It then went north to the transcontinental route outside Reno, eastward to Salt Lake City, and finally southwest to Las Vegas on the rail link to Los Angeles.

By 1944 enough magnesium metal—more than 80,000 tons—had been made for the wartime demand. The mine has continued producing magnesite and some brucite ever since, however, for those other applications, and is now the only producer in the United States. It is also said to be the oldest continuously operating mine in Nevada.]]></summary>

Hoping to invoke the sights, sounds, and smells of old Cuban Key West (Cayo Hueso), you will see a cigar factory, a sightseeing bus, stores, a boxing gym, cafés, and street scenes that were all originally created as woodcarvings by the noted folk artist.

One notable exception was the Norfolk & Western Railway, which crisscrossed the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia. It was there that a self-taught photographer would snap some of the most evocative and dramatic photos of steam railroading in its final days. 

O. Winston Link was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1914. Link began dabbling with amateur photography as a teenager. Although he completed a degree in civil engineering, he soon found himself working as a commercial photographer, where he further developed his skills through on-the-job training.

In 1955, while on assignment in Virginia, Link became captivated by the Norfolk & Western Railway's steam locomotives. Recognizing th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Asociación México Japonesa (Mexico Japanese Association) was established in 1956 as a result of efforts from Mexico's Japanese migrant and Japanese descendant communities, looking to establish tighter relationships between both countries and cultures. The current location was opened three years later thanks to the donation of its terrain by San Siro Matsumoto.

Its initial cultural offerings for the non-Japanese population included gardens, language lessons, and the establishment of a restaurant. They would later be joined by other lessons in subjects like ikebana and origami, a minimarket, and the Manga Museum.

This museum was established thanks to a donation of almost 20,000 volumes from a museum of the same name in the city of Kyoto. This means that the vast majority of the material available is exclusively in the Japanese language. The volumes in Spanish and English are limited to a mere couple of shelves.

Another bookshelf features a selection of volumes for sale, most of these also in Japanese. For the fans who have actually learned the language, this Museum represents what might be Mexico City's most important collection.]]></summary>

For ice core “librarian” Jørgen Peder Steffensen, who oversees the chilly archive, the cores are a time machine. “All those annual layers of snowfall are just in one undisturbed sequence back in time,” Steffensen tells Hakai Magazine. “The deeper you go, the farther back i…]]></summary>

Designed by priest Louis Vallet and completed in 1924, Da Nang Cathedral is the only Catholic church in the city that dates back to the French colonial era. Its built-in solemn Gothic style, but its adorable, candy-pink façade softens the imposing impression.

While tourists, knowingly or not, refer to the cathedral simply as the “Pink Church,” the locals of Da Nang have another nickname for it: the Chicken Church. It comes from the metal weathercock that stands atop the building, representing the Gallic rooster as well as referencing the Biblical episode of St. Peter’s Denial, in which the crowing of a rooster plays a significant role.]]></summary>

Known as "America's Oldest Gas Station" Reighard's is made of cinder blocks with hardened concrete shingles and took advantage of being along the rail line. In the late 1800s, George Hinkle sold kerosene, then lamp oil, and after seeing the advent of horseless carriages, began selling gasoline.

Hinkle purchased petroleum products from Samuel S. Reighard, an oil merchant. Shortly after switching to gas, Hinkle sold the station to George D. Reighard, a son of Samuel Reighard. Martin Oil Company purchased the station in 1978 and continues the tradition of full service.]]></summary>

What sits atop the plinth, however, is not a statue of the father of utopian socialist theory; instead, a giant silver apple with the countries of the world etched into its reflective surface sits in his place.

A bronze statue of Fourier's likeness did once stand proudly atop the monument. The thinker and writer gained notoriety throughout the early 19th century for proclaiming what were, at the time, radical notions: he questioned the cult of industrial labor, espoused socialist ideals, and coined the term "feminism." One of his less radical views—again, given the time—framed Jews as regressive and uncivilized. Ironically, during the Occupation of 1942, it was Nazis who…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The city of Kupferberg ('Copper Mountain'), renamed 'Miedzianka' when the territory passed from Germany to Poland after World War II, was one of many prosperous mining towns in the mountains of Lower Silesia. As the name indicates, it was originally copper that was mined in this area—until the Soviets discovered after their occupation in 1945 that the local mines were also a rich source of uranium.

The Soviets quickly fenced off the area with barbed wire and forced local Poles to work in the uranium mines with no knowledge of the actual dangers. Officially, it was called a "paper factory," and miners suffering from radiation poisoning were formally ignored. Anyone who attempted to reveal the true nature of the mines near Miedzianka was promptly 'disappeared' by the Communist government and never seen again.

After about 600 tonnes of uranium were shipped from Miedzianka to the Soviet Union, the local mine was considered to be exhausted, and the extensive tunneling underneath the town had left the ground unstable. The town itself was then torn down in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and most of the residents were forcibly resettled to the nearby city of Jelenia Góra.

Today, Miedzianka only exists in the form of a few scattered buildings, a church, and a resurrected form of its once-famous brewery along one surviving mountain road. The surrounding fields and forests are filled with the overgrown ruins of houses, factories, and cemeteries that used to form part of the city. Information boards on what was formerly the main square tell the story, accompanied by numerous photos, of what was once the bustling city center of Kupferberg/Miedzianka, now almost completely forgotten to the passage of time.]]></summary>

Speeding towards Rasalhague and the other stars that make up the "Serpent-bearer" is Voyager 1, the farthest human-made object in the universe. It’s currently 14.8 billion miles (23.8 billion kilometers) from the Sun, and still speeding away at roughly 38,000 miles per hour (61,000 kilometers per hour).

That’s too far to observe Voyager 1 twinkle in the night sky, but you can turn the tables and see what it sees as it looks back at us. Via NASA’s Eyes website (and app), you can pay a virtual visit to where the spacecraft is now and explore its vantage as it hurtles towards the ed…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fisherman's House ("La Casita del Pescador" in Spanish) is a small "capricho" construction in the northern part of Retiro Park in Madrid. It was conceived as a personal whim of the king who saved Retiro Park. The house was destined to offer his majesty a place to rest and is located on the central island of a pond where, back in the day, you could even fish.

After the War of Independence, the park was badly damaged and was rebuilt by King Fernando VII. During this Renaissance, exotic and beautiful constructions such as the Persian Hall and Fisherman's House were created. Isidro González Velázquez designed this house and surrounded it with a pond for anglers to enjoy. The house has a striking pinkish body, adorned with Pompeian-style paintings and frescoes and with niches, where Roman busts once stood.

This type of construction had its predecessors in the so-called 18th-century pavilions that were prominent in English and French gardens. In Spain, these curious structures appeared in important gardens at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century.

For years, the Fisherman's House remained abandoned and was eventually used as a Tourist Information Office. It is now the Municipal Center for the Adoption of Pets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1889, a rakish Neapolitan pizzaiolo by the name of Raffaele Esposito gifted three of his pies to Queen Margherita of Savoy, the beautiful Piedmontese wife of King Umberto I. As the story goes, he fashioned one with the colors of the freshly unified nation of Italy’s flag and named it, of course, pizza Margherita. A plaque in Naples proudly declares where the queen’s meal allegedly took place. There’s just one catch to this familiar tale: None of it is true.

In her latest book, National Dish: Around the World in Search of Food, History, and the Meaning of Home, Anya von Bremzen goes on a multi-year quest to parse the myths and misunderstandings swirling around canonical foods like pizza Margherita. In the process, she “crushes” bowls of noodles with a ramen otaku in Tokyo, learns to ma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The modern Polish city of Kostrzyn nad Odrą lies directly on the Oder river, which has formed the border between Poland and Germany since World War II. Prior to 1945, the city was mostly inhabited by ethnic Germans and called "Küstrin" (also listed in some places as "Cüstrin"), but the German residents were forced to leave as a result of the border changes after the war. Ethnic Poles settled in their place, although not in the strictest geographical sense: the historical city centre of Kostrzyn/Küstrin was so throughly destroyed in the war that it had become uninhabitable, so the incoming Poles built what amounted to a new city center about 1 km (0.6 miles) to the northeast.

The historical city center, once a densely-populated, fortified settlement on the Oder River, was left to fall into ruin, and was eventually torn down entirely. Today, the historical center is a free public park that has been largely reclaimed by nature. The foundations and cellars of the pre-war buildings are still visible, the main sights (like the church, city hall, and market square) are all labeled, and the original streets are still signposted, as if directing tourists around a ghostly city that still exists among the ruins.

There is a small, free museum near the former city center's entrance (next to the old border crossing) as well as a larger paid, seasonal museum in the "Filip Bastion", one of the surviving fortifications on the eastern edge of the former city center. There are few restrictions in the park and it's possible to explore the city ruins to your heart's content.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Japanese idiom nureginu has been in continuous use since the Heian period (794-1185) and means "false accusation" or "frame-up," while its literal definition is "wet clothes." Though the word is frequently used today, its etymology remains rather obscure even to native Japanese speakers. Still, it is no doubt an idiom suggesting the existence of some sort of story behind its origin.

Legend has it that, during the reign of Emperor Shōmu (724-749), a nobleman named Chikayo Sano was appointed as the governor of Chikuzen Province (today Fukuoka) and came from Kyoto to Hakata, bringing his daughter Haruhime and his second wife. Envious of her stepdaughter's beauty, Sano's wife decided to frame her up and ruin her life. She bribed the local fisherman and bought his still-wet kimono, then hung it up in Haruhime's room.

When Sano came back home that night, his wife told him that Haruhime has stolen the fisherman's kimono—or, according to a variation of the story, is having an affair with him—and upon seeing the wet kimono in her room, Sano became furious and killed her in her sleep. A year later, the ghost of Haruhime appeared in Sano's dreams, claiming her innocence. Realizing his irreversible mistake, Sano turned his back on the world and spent the rest of his life as a monk.

Today, on the site of the Nureginu-zuka or the "Tomb of the Wet Kimono" stands a basalt stele, with three Sanskrit letters and the date 1344 inscribed on it. Originally standing beside the west gate of Shōfuku-ji Temple, it was first relocated to the Mikasa riverside during the Edo period, and then moved again to its current place in 2001. There is also a relief depicting the legend on the nearby Ishido Bridge.]]></summary>

An unassuming pile of rocks marked by a simple metal plaque can easily escape your notice.

However, this pile of rocks represents by far the oldest still-standing human-made structure in the city of Helsinki. It is a Bronze Age burrow grave of an unknown individual. The grave is estimated to be over 3,000 years old.

The choice of the location and the amount of effort needed to make it tell us that its occupant must have enjoyed a special status in his community in their lifetime. Unfortunately, very little else is known about this burial site.]]></summary>

The structure featured Wright's very first perfectly flat roof, and was the only boathouse he ever designed. However, a lack of budget on the students' part led to it never being built. While Wright did finish the plans, it was never built in Wright's or even Beye's lifetime, and for a long time it remained the only unbuilt building in Wright's famous Wasmuth Portfolio, a German book containing multiple works of his that first skyrocketed his popularity across the world.

Luckily, in 2007, construction began on this beautiful structure, with the assistance of one of Wright's apprentices. Today it not only serves its original purpose as a place for a boating group (The West Side Rowing Club nowadays), but it also holds weddings and tours, of which there is more information on its website. It's a hidden gem in the shadows of other Wright-designed buildings in Buffalo, like the Darwin D. Martin House.]]></summary>

I got my first telescope for Christmas when I was nine or 10. Growing up, I would spend hours and hours out in the back garden, staring up at the stars and planets in the shadow of our very conventional two-up, two-down, semi-detached house in Colchester, some 50 miles northeast of London. I would stick it out for as long as I could, until I got so cold that I had to come in. Ever since I've always had a telescope.

As I got older, I still carried on looking through telescopes, but the band started taking off in the 1990s, so that took up most of my time. Once I wa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tenugui is a sort of traditional Japanese towel, literally meaning “hand wiper,” but often used for other purposes than simply wiping one’s hands. Historically, it was an all-purpose piece of cloth; some wore it as a scarf, some wrapped bento boxes with it, while it was also used in place of a belt, bandage, apron, and diaper.

 One of Japan’s oldest continuously running businesses, Eirakuya was originally established in 1615 by fabric merchant Hosotsuji Ihe’e, a favorite of Oda Nobunaga—one of the most illustrious figures in Japanese history. The shop’s name derives from Eiraku Tsūhō, a Ming dynasty coin that widely circulated back then, so common that Nobunaga adopted it as one of his crests. Men of the Hosotsuji clan also wore the coin crest to show their loyalty to the samurai warlord…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana, who would later come to be known by the name of Sor (Sister) Juana Inés de la Cruz (Sor Juana for short), was a 17th-century writer who made an impact not only on the literature but also the religious establishment and feminism of New Spain, now Mexico. At the time, religious women were practically the only ones allowed to receive an education, so she joined a nunnery in her mid-teens in 1667.

Two years later she would enter Mexico City's Convento de San Jerónimo, where she remained cloistered until her death in 1695. From this convent, she wrote a large number of poems and philosophical treatises, many of which advocated for women's rights, which was a rarity at the time, especially for someone embedded in the patriarchy of Catholicism.

Sor Juana's impact continues to be felt to this day, and her habit-clad face has appeared on Mexican banknotes since the 1970s. A take on this same portrait is found in the Porrúa bookstore in the city's historic center.

Librería Porrúa was established in 1900 by the three Porrúa brothers who immigrated from Spain. Their flagship bookstore, where this mosaic is located, was opened in 1910; although the building dates to the 18th century. Their 1914 Mexican poetry compilation is considered the first modern book entirely edited and printed in the country.

Combining the heritages of Sor Juana (who was considered Criolla, or entirely of European descent) and the Porrúa Brothers, this mosaic can be seen as a tribute not only to literature in Mexico, but also to Spanish-Mexican culture. Unveiled on November 12, 2020, the mural sits on shelves 4.8 meters tall and 3.6 meters wide, and is made out of books and artists' charcoal.

The date choice was not coincidental, as this was the 372nd anniversary of Sor Juana's birth. November 12 was also chosen as Mexico's National Book Day in 1980, again in honor of Sor Juana's importance, making this tribute doubly significant.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes referred to as the Oratorio dei Morti di Peste del 1630, this chapel was erected in memory of those that died of plague in the year 1630. 

The history of this church goes back to the year 1044, when a deed was drawn mentioning a church dedicated to San Lorenzo, which indicated that this church was one of the oldest in existence at the time. Unfortunately, the original structure was destroyed to make place for a new fortification during the 16th century. While the old one was being destroyed, a new one was being constructed. Completed by the end of the 16th century, the new church of San Lorenzo alla Boccola is the very same structure that has survived to this day.

History, however, took a sharp turn during the next century. An outbreak of plague that had spread throughout Europe finally reached Italy and, between 1629 and 1631, this pestilence claimed at least 280,000 lives—with some estimates putting the figure to 1 million.

In memory of those that died of plague, the Oratorio dei Morti was built next to the church of San Lorenzo alla Boccola. Above the door, it is believed that a semi-circular lintel used to frame a fresco by Vincenzo Bonomini. However, by the beginning of the 20th century, all that was left of this artwork were faint blotches, and it was decided that a new fresco should replace it. A young artist by the name of Emilio Nembrini undertook this mission, and the new fresco was unveiled in 1936.

The new monochromatic fresco is dominated by two main figures, Death and the dead, which are standing on each side of a slate that bears the following text: “resting here from the church move the bones of our brothers pray to their souls solace light and peace.” Although punctuation is not present, the meaning is quite straightforward.  To complete this somber composition are leaves, wreaths, skulls, and reclining pillars.]]></summary>

Doctors have a lab coat and a stethoscope, fireman have a yellow hard hat, and so on. However, many of these stereotypes change over time, to the point where the old ones are no longer recognizable. The wizard-like robes and pointy hat of the astronomer is one such getup. 

The Sternenwächter, or the Astronomer, is a statue that was built by Christine Gersch in 2005 on a small square in Berlin that was named after the 18th-century astronomer Caroline Herschel. She is known for her many discoveries, star catalogs, and for being the first female scientist to get a salary for her work. (She and her brother William's former home in England is now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy.)

The statue represents an old depiction of an astronomer, who walks around with blue robes and a pointy hat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just south of the Trans-Canada Highway and overlooking the Blackfoot buffalo jump is the Saamis Teepee.

Designed for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary as a symbol of Canada's Aboriginal heritage, it was moved to Medicine Hat in 1991. It stands over 20 stories high and was designed to withstand extreme temperatures and winds.

During a January 2007 windstorm, a portion of the teepee was damaged. Upon further inspection, it was discovered that extensive weathering was partially to blame. After repairs were complete, the Saamis Teepee now stands approximately 15 feet (four meters) shorter.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Henry "Box" Brown was an abolitionist born into slavery during the early 19th century. After his wife and children were sold away to a North Carolina plantation in 1848, Brown sought to free himself from his bondage.

Armed with only some water and a manual drill, he squeezed into a three-foot-long, two-foot-tall shipping box with only three air holes. He endured a 27-hour trip via wagon and steamer until he arrived safely in Philidelphia, Pennsylvania. Brown would go on to travel throughout New England to speak of the evils of enslavement. 

Along the Richmond Canal walk rests a steel reproduction of Henry's box, memorializing the stories of those who sought freedom from Richmond's slavery.]]></summary>

The castle is somewhat mysterious, with little suggesting why it was built at the bottom of a hill or what it looked like, while the medieval village lies undisturbed beneath a field where a rare breed of goat calls home. In the Second World War, the Alvis Company built a tank testing track on the site running parallel to the River Sowe.

Bagot's Castle is also home to a number of Bagot goats, one of the oldest known breeds of goat in Britain. These small black-and-white goats have been roaming the hills of this area for more than 600 years.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Famous Polish composer and politician Ignacy Paderewski died unexpectedly in New York City in 1941. He had wanted to be buried either next to his wife in Paris, or in Poland, but at the time both were occupied by the Nazis. President Franklin Roosevelt had Paderewski's body interred inside the USS Maine Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery "until Poland is free."

The war ended, but Poland still wasn't free; it was occupied by the USSR. Paris was free, but apparently, that destination wasn't appealing to the custodians of Paderewski's corpse. It stayed in Arlington until after the Berlin Wall fell in 1991, when it was finally returned to Poland. Paderewski's ashes were interred in a crypt at St. John's Archcathedral in Warsaw.

But his heart stayed behind. He loved the United States so much that it was decided that his heart should remain here. It was extracted from his corpse and placed inside a bronze version of his head, which was then relocated to the Our Lady of Czestochowa Cemetery in predominantly Polish-American Doylestown, Pennsylvania. It's been there ever since.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cerveno is a tiny rural village located in Valcamonica that dates back at least to the 14th century. The first mention of Cerveno was in a medieval treaty stating that this village sided with the Ghibellines. Although the fortunes of this village waxed and waned through the centuries, the one thing that remained constant was its vineyards. A network of narrow roads snakes through the estates surrounding Cerveno. Some estates consist of vineyards and other crops, while others are completely covered with vineyard lines. Unsurprisingly, the art of wine-making is an integral part of the village’s identity.

Approaching Cerveno from the north, there is a gigantic horizontal lever press (Torchio a Leva Orizzontale) nestled between the vineyard and some ancient buildings. This is a working press…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transporter bridges are rather unusual bridges. They don't have an elevated road or walkway crossing over a river, chasm, or any other obstacle. Instead, transporter bridges use a moving platform suspended under a boom to transfer people, vehicles, or other things from one end of the bridge to the other. They are usually built in locations where a normal bridge may not be functional for various reasons. For example, a drawbridge may not be practical in some locations with ship traffic, or if not enough space is available on either side of a riverbank for approach ramps leading to a standard road bridge, a transporter bridge might be a more practical alternative.

Transporter bridges are also relatively rare. The United Kingdom currently has only three transporter bridges designed to carry vehicles, and the Warrington Transporter Bridge is one of them. The bridge was constructed in 1916 to connect two different parts of the chemical and soap plant operated by Joseph Crosfield & Sons. (This bridge was actually the second one built in Warrington over the River Mersey; the first bridge was built in 1905 but was later demolished in the 1960s.)

The steel bridge, which spans a section of the river that is 61 meters wide, has a height of 23 meters and a total length of 103 meters. The bridge was originally used to transport railway vehicles from one side of the river to the other but was later modified in the 1940s to transport road vehicles.

The bridge ceased to be used in 1964. It became a listed structure in 1975, which protected the bridge from demolition, but the bridge has been slowly decaying since. However, the people of Warrington are very proud of their bridge, and a group named the Friends of Warrington Transporter Bridge (FoWTB) formed in 2015 to raise awareness about the bridge as well as to work with Warrington Borough Council to try to restore the structure.

The Warrington Transporter Bridge may still be non-functional, but it has become one of the defining symbols of Warrington.]]></summary>

Long before the Battle of Gettysburg occurred, dinosaurs roamed the area and left their mark. Located on the bridge are three dinosaur footprints.

On one side is the print of Anchisauripus sillimani, a two-legged lion-sized meat eater. On the other are the prints of a dog-sized plant eater, Atreipus milfordensi. The bridge was made in 1938 from sandstone or siltstone taken from the Trostle Quarry in Adams County, Pennsylvania.

There is nothing to indicate they are there so enjoy hunting for dinosaur tracks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Towards the back of the biodiversity hall at the Australian Museum is a rare taxidermy specimen of an adult female thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus). With her golden fur and iconic rear stripes she stands tall beside a small, damaged pelvis of a dodo bird in an extinction display. This individual specimen was registered by the Australian Museum in 1902, 34 years before the last known individual thylacine died in captivity at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart. Upon close inspection, the taxidermist's stitching is visible along the marsupial's stomach and tail. These marks were made over 120 years ago.

Thylacines were once found across mainland Australia and New Guinea, but evidence suggests that its range was restricted to Tasmania around 2,000 years ago. Considered a pest by European settlers, thylacines were falsely believed to kill livestock. From 1888-1909,  a government bounty led to their depletion in the wild. As the species became rare, specimens became valued by zoos, museums, and private collectors. According to the International Thylacine Specimen Database, over 750 individuals are in collections spread across 23 countries.

From around 1999-2005, the Australian Museum was involved with a thylacine cloning project and scientists extracted thylacine DNA from preserved specimens in its collection. Although the Museum no longer participates in this project, it is an active area of research in Australia.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Decatur Waterworks was originally built in 1907 and supplied water to the city of Decatur until the 1940s, but had been utilized as a public park since the 1930s, when many amenities like benches, grills, and a stone bridge that crosses over Burnt Fork Creek were added. This same bridge is now part of the trail that connects Medlock Park and Mason Mill Park.

By 1939, the waterworks contained two storage tanks, an office building, two aeration and solid removal tanks, and two dams, one on Burnt Fork Creek and the other on South Peachtree Creek. By 1941 the city had outgrown the water capacity of the waterworks, so the property was leased out to Dekalb County. Dekalb continued to operate the facility and sold water to Decatur. Using the revenue from this venture, they funded a county-wide water treatment plant in Dunwoody, which is currently called the Scott Candler Plant.

The waterworks supplied the Naval Air Station (now Peachtree Dekalb Airport) during World War II. During this time absolutely no recreational use was allowed. When the war ended the waterworks was given back to the city of Decatur and acted as a backup for their new system. While the waterworks were in use, the park was not being maintained or publicly used.

By the early 1950s, the waterworks fell into a state of disrepair due to lack of use. Residents of nearby neighborhoods in the mid-1960s complained of flooding, and in response both dams were broken and the reservoirs were destroyed.

The Decatur Waterworks was declared a historic site in 2006 and shortly after this, the construction of a trail began in 2008. This trail has received funding from the PATH Foundation and has since been completed.]]></summary>

For much of 20th-century American history, restaurants, bars, and even impromptu potlucks provided safe spaces for the LGBTQ+ community. While specific foods or drinks were never really the point of these spaces, there’s a lot we can learn about queer history through them.
Vegetarian fare sustained lesbian protesters in the 1970s, while tea and community could be found at clandestine queer hangouts in the 1920s. Early LGBTQ+ cookbooks sought to normalize queer joy and, in some cases, fund further activism. This Pride month, here are a few of Gastro’s favorite stories from the archives about LGBTQ+ culinary change-makers.

For starters, this puddingstone is 370 million years old and strangely evocative of a human profile. The surrounding area is dotted with engraved stones bearing the poems of Emile Verhaeren.

According to legend, Satan was enraged at Saint Remacle building the Abbey of Stavelot. To prevent the inauguration, he set out from the Pyrenees with a huge rock on his back, with the aim of throwing it at the church. But on the way, he met a poor man who told him that the road was still long. Discouraged and furious at not being able to arrive in time to spoil the festivities, the devil dropped his stone, which sank into the ground.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heilstatte Grabowsee was established by the German Red Cross in 1896, originally designed as a test facility. It was theorized that the fresh air in the region would aid treatment for respiratory issues like tuberculosis. Eventually, the hospital grew in size to well over 300 patients.

The hospital was seized by the Soviet Army during World War II, and was used as a military hospital. 

Since then, most of the buildings have remained abandoned, but the set has found a second life as an occasional film set, having had scenes from Heilstatten and The Monuments Men filmed on site. Recently, the owners of the site have made tours available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dalt Vila is the Eivissa walled old town with origins that date back to pre-Roman times. It has a labyrinthine framework of narrow streets and picturesque squares. If instead of going up the steep slopes and stairs that lead to the highest point of the promontory where the cathedral is located, you wander through the adjacent streets, you can find something hidden and often overlooked by tourists. A small exhibition that recalls Hollywood's Walk of Fame, but in this case, it is a wall of a house where some concrete plates with handprints (or footprints) of some celebrities, not only about cinema, are hung.

Many of the celebrities on the wall hail from German-speaking areas. There are plaques of Germans like the singer Sandra Schwarzhaupt or the actor Fritz Wepper, the Swiss football player Fritz Kün who printed his feet, the filmmaker Fritz E. Maeder, the Austrian actor Ulrich Reinthaller, and Dutch actor Frijda Nelly. There are also representatives of Spain like the sculptor Miguel Ortiz Berrocal, businessman Enrique Sarasola, and the popular actor Penelope Cruz.

The origin of this concentration of celebrities maybe it is due to a local initiative and after continued by a program on German television in the 1990s from the channel SAT1 hosted by Margarethe Schreinemakers, which reached an audience of millions every week between 1992 and 1996 with her talk show Schreinemakers Live. It seems that one of the activities of the show was to appear with these celebrities in Ibiza, many of them linked to the Balearic Islands, to leave their immortalized prints.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situated in a valley in the Tuscan countryside, the striking vaulted interior of this crypt is hiding in  plain sight. Records show that a monastery has existed on this site for more than 1,000 years. The space passed through various religious orders over the centuries, including the Carthusian monks of San Galgano at Monte Siepi in the 1400s and later the Augustine Order.

The crypt itself most likely dates all the way back to the Benedictine Order in Giugnano, which occupied the area around 1075. This burial ground was passed over in later iterations and has decayed spectacularly with the passing of time. Traces of frescoed walls can still be seen, as can the four original naves and the remnants of ornate stone carvings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Memorial Lakes are a group of three clear blue alpine lakes that are not far off from the popular Ribbon Creek Trail. Despite this the lakes remain under the radar for most hikers and tourists visiting Alberta's Rockies. But aside from its beautiful view the lakes are also known for a tragic series of events in the summer of 1986 that gave them their name.

Hikers at the third lake may notice a large brick cairn on its shore, dedicated by the Alberta government, that lists the names of 13 people along with a quote. On June 6, 1986, a Cessna carrying wildlife biologist Orvall Pall, who was monitoring Bighorn sheep populations, and pilot Ken Wolff crashed into a forested section of Mount Kidd, killing both. Following the Cessna's noted absence, friends of the pilot hastily took off in their own Cessna to search for the missing plane. Only hours after the initial crash, the Cessna searching for Ovrall and Ken crashed into the side of the nearby Mount Lougheed, killing all three onboard.

In the following days, several search groups were organized to look for the two missing planes numbering in the hundreds, joining in these efforts included the Canadian air force and multiple other government agencies. Despite the difficult weather, the wreckage of the second plane was found on June 9th. Finding the first plane remained more difficult, due to the forested area it crashed concealing the wreckage. On June 14, a Canadian air force DHC-6 Twin Otter, searching for the first plane crashed onto a cliff on Cox Hill killing the eight people onboard and starting a forest fire, which hampered early efforts by personnel on the ground who witnessed the crash to reach the crash site.

An investigation into the third crash found that a visual illusion caused by the sun gave the illusion that the surface of the mountain was smoother than it actually was, it is possible that this same illusion could be to blame for the two other crashes as well. The wreckage of the first plane was found on June 18.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sava Centar is a prominent convention and cultural center located on the right bank of the Sava River, in the municipality of Novi Beograd. It is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city as it is a very wide, peculiar building clad in glass panels, which has lent it the nicknames of "crystal palace/castle" and such.

Historically, the Sava Centar has hosted a wide range of events, including business conferences, trade shows, domestic and international concerts, ballet and dance performances, theatre plays, art exhibitions, and more. It is home to many of the most monumental political conferences that occurred in the former Yugoslavia. Today, it is still open to the public, who can go in to see its wondrous retro interior in a massive building that will leave you in awe of its uniqueness on every floor.

The construction of the Sava Centar began in 1976 and was completed in 1979. It was designed by a team of Yugoslav architects led by Stojan Maksimović, taking on a Yugoslav modernist or Brutalist style that was popular at the time. The complex was originally built to host the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as well as various other large-scale conferences, cultural events, and performances.

Nowadays, Sava Centar is a must-visit due to its 70s interior, which has been largely untouched as if to capture the vibrant and prosperous Yugoslav past of the city. There is a beautiful and very iconic world clock that you must see in the lobby, as well as admirable conference halls where history was born. There are areas of exquisite metalwork as well as a blue-stained glow from the main windows next to plants, quaint bar areas, stalls, and little local indoor clothes shops.]]></summary>

Every year in May, the village hosts the British Asparagus Festival with Morris dancing, asparagus songs, demonstrations of traditional asparagus-tying, and guest appearances from Gus the Asparagus Man and Eve, the Asparagus Fairy. Anyone wanting to know what the future holds seeks out Jemima Packington, the world’s only “Asparamancer.” Packington makes her predictions by throwing asparagus spears into the air and interpreting how they fall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technically speaking, Vatican City and San Marino are not the only countries that exist within Italy. In fact, there is also the Order of Malta, a Roman Catholic lay religious order that functions as a sovereign entity of international law, albeit without a physical territory.

Established as an offshoot of the medieval Knights Hospitaller, the Order of Malta was, as its name suggests, originally based on the island of Malta, which was given to them in 1530 by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The island was invaded by Napoleon in 1798, then taken over by the British Empire in 1814, leaving the Order of Malta without any territory.

The order was disbanded but restored in 1834 under the new name Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta. Its new headquarters was placed in Palazzo Malta in Rome, a 16th-century building owned by the order since 1630, and it was granted extraterritoriality in 1869 alongside its other headquarters, Villa Malta.

Today, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM) is recognized by over 100 countries as an independent sovereign entity, maintaining diplomatic relations with them. It has its own passport, coins, and stamps, and Palazzo Malta's extraterritoriality continues to this day, functioning as the de-facto capital of the Order of Malta.]]></summary>

One such palace (Lofen) was in Utrecht, Netherlands. In 1253 the city suffered a fire that lasted nine days, during which it is believed Lofen was destroyed. The location became the property of the chapter of the Dom Church.

Many iterations of development are believed to have occurred; the major ones presented as architectural rendering when touring the site.

On August 1, 1674, a storm hit Utrecht. Some say a hurricane but others a tornado which seems more likely as the destruction was very selective. The nave of the cathedral that occupied that site at the time came crashing down, largely destroying the church but leaving other buildings of the complex intact. Towers of 5 other churches and all but 2 windmills in Utrecht did not survive the storm. 

The nave was never rebuilt, but the basic structure of the area is currently represented using different colored bricks to indicate the footprint of the nave and its supports. This area is now an open pedestrian walkway. 

However, near the center of this is a secured stairwell providing access to some of the original underground support structure of the nave as well as piles of holy stonework presented as rubble. The tour includes a CGI recreation of what it would have been like being inside the nave during its collapse, it's fairly terrifying.

Though it is believed several people were killed during the collapse, only one skeleton remains and is also presented in this underground tour. Nobody seems sure as to who this was, which is odd as there is a headstone is right there! Most theories involve a patron of the church.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-20T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Located in the Seobinggo district of Seoul, the National Museum of Korea boasts a huge, impressive collection of ancient artifacts. Not only does it have thousands of items from Korea’s past dynasties—from Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo to Balhae to Yi of Joseon—it also exhibits a number of antiquities from Mesopotamia, Central Asia, India, China, and Japan, as well as the Greco-Roman world.

One of the non-Korean artifacts is a well-patinated bronze Corinthian helmet, dated to the 6th century B.C. It is an impressive antiquity on its own indeed, but it may be somewhat peculiar that it has its own exhibit space, considering how it is not the only Greek artifact at the National Museum, and that it quite possibly has more interesting items in its collection.

Then, why does it have a whole room for itself? The answer lies in its history—not all the way back to Corinth in the 6th century B.C. but to Berlin in 1936. That year, world-renowned marathoner Son Kee Chung, alternatively Sohn Ki-jung (1912-2002), won a gold medal at the Summer Olympics, breaking the record of that time.

The winner of the 1936 Olympics was to be awarded the helmet, found in Olympia and purchased by the local newspaper, but the IOC decided that it was too valuable an item to be given away. More unfortunately, Son had to register and run not for Korea but for Japan—as Korea was occupied by the empire at that time—a status he was vehemently against.


It was not until 1986, at a reception in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Olympic Games, that he finally received the helmet. Until then, it had been displayed at the Charlottenburg Museum despite its rightful owner’s continuous efforts to have it back.

Out of respect for the artifact’s historical value, Son donated the Hellenic helmet to the National Museum in 1994. The Korean government designated it as its 904th National Treasure, the only Western article to be given the honor.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(author's website pdf , arxiv version ) is just a spectacularly good review article about fluid mechanics (broadly defined to include a bit about foams and viscoelastic systems) and food/drink.  The article is broadly structured like a menu (drinks & cocktails for multiphase flows; soups & starters for complex fluids; hot entrees for thermal effects; desserts for viscous flows; coffee for granular effects; tea for suspensions and mixing; and dishwashing for flows at interfaces).  

I know I'm a particular niche demographic, in that I'm a scientist who likes cooking and actually had mech-e training in fluid mechanics, but trust me:  this article is just excellent, touching on a ton of interesting phenomena that you can play with in your own kitchen, while making connections to cutting-edge ongoing research.

An extremely important 1-ton sculpture, sometimes referred to by archaeologists as an “Earth Monster” or Monument 9, was repatriated to Mexico from a private collection in Colorado in May 2023, according to an announcement from Mexico’s Consul General in New York. The monument features the head of a front-facing creature with a gaping mouth: a supernatural being that represented the living, animate earth to an ancient culture in Central America and Mexico.

This sculpture was reportedly found at the base of a hill at Chalcatzingo, an archaeological site some 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Mexico City, and dates to roughly 600 B.C. Chalcatzingo is closely related to Olmec cult…]]></summary>

“It has to be at least six layers,” insists Charlotte McGehee, co-owner of Bakery Bar and Debbie on the Levee, two bakeries in New Orleans, Louisiana, that specialize in the locally famous doberge (DOH-bash) cake.

“In my opinion, fewer than six is just a regular ol’ layer cake,” she says. “You miss out on that feeling of your fork working through each alternating texture, and the nervousness you get because you don’t want that beautiful tower of cake to topple before you make it to the bottom.”

One of the most popular destinations in Vietnam today, it is home to the Imperial City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993, as well as the Thiên Mụ temple complex and numerous mausoleums of Nguyễn emperors.

Almost across the Perfume River from the Thiên Mụ temple, however, there is also an unusual historic site overlooked by most visitors. Walk along the narrow residential alleys of the Trường Đá village and it will soon reveal itself all of a sudden, at the end of the street: the Tiger Arena, a huge enclosure surrounded by 16-foot-tall walls.

While it may look like an ancient Roman arena, the site once held mortal combats even more intriguing and perhaps cruel than gladiatorial games. Hổ Qu…]]></summary>

The tri-border point, or Dreiländereck as it is called in German, marks the point where Germany, France, and Switzerland intersect. The marker itself is built to resemble a futuristic rocket, with one of the three country flags on each of the wings. It is located on a piece of Swiss land approximately 150 meters (495 feet) southeast of the actual point where the three borders intersect.

What makes this tri-border point rare compared to most is that there are no passports or visas needed to cross it, or any other border in that location, given that all three countries have a free travel agreement.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every Christmas season, the owner of this house, a harpist for the Pacific Northwest Ballet Orchestra in Seattle, hauls these figures over from a storage facility and carefully installs them in the yard. After a few days, they are ready to entertain local neighbors, offering them the most enchanting, cheerful, and, of course, wild, holiday experience ever created in a garden lawn.

These figures were originally designed by none other than Maurice Sendak, the author who is known for his whimsical children's books, such as Where the Wild Things Are. They were used as lobby displays for the Pacific Northwest Ballet's production of The Nutcracker, which was performed from 1983 to 2014, and of which the sets and costumes were designed by Sendak himself. Since 2015, PNB has done George Balanchine's version, with art by another children's author, Ian Falconer.

Besides the iconic Sendak sculptures, this display is sure to please you during the holidays. From the enormous 15-foot Nutcracker to the lovely ornaments on the tree, this is a unique holiday experience unlike any other in the Seattle suburbs. If you look closely at the house's roof, you can even see a cutout of the Wild Thing from Sendak's iconic book. And, of course, the house even features the original stage props that were used onstage prior to their retirement.

Even though this Nutcracker production no longer performs, its spirit lives on in this magical holiday wild rumpus, preserving a large part of Seattle's own holiday history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Hitler had elaborate military bunker complexes built throughout Masuria (then part of Germany, now part of Poland) in order to keep a closer eye on the war effort. While Hitler and his inner circle based themselves at the infamous Wolf's Lair, the Nazis' Supreme Military Command was located at a separate site called "Mauerwald" (now Mamerki) just 20 kilometers to the northeast.

The full Mauerwald military complex consisted of nearly 250 separate buildings and bunkers constructed in the forest just west of Mauer Lake (now Mamry Lake), the majority of which remain abandoned and freely accessible in the woods. The heart of the compound, however, is now confined within the Mamerki Bunker Museum, which seeks to preserve the core bunker structures. The museum is complete with underground tunnels and exhibitions on the Nazi war effort, including full-size recreations of daily life in the bunkers and other scenes.

Adding to the location's lore, Mauerwald is also one of several locations theorized to be a possible hiding place of the Amber Room. Erich Koch, purportedly the last person to have known the room's fate, was brought to the site in the 1970s as part of the search, and ground-penetrating radar has also been used since 2016 to search for hidden chambers. Although the search has proved fruitless so far, the sheer size of the complex suggests that it may still have additional secrets to reveal.]]></summary>

Meanwhile, in Thailand, the kingdom of Ayutthaya was in desperate need of military reinforcements as the Toungoo dynasty of Burma continued its invasion. Sharing common interests, the king welcomed hundreds of masterless samurai to his army as mercenaries.

At the same time, unrelated to the Burmese-Siamese Wars, many Japanese merchants came to Ayutthaya to export high-quality swords while importing Thai silver, ceramics, and leatherware. It was not long before a Japanese village was formed on the southeast side of the Chao Phraya river, opposite the Portuguese settlement.

It is generally believed that the Japanese population in Ayutthaya was around 1,500, while som…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silver was discovered in Ophir Canyon in the 1860s, but early mining efforts were defeated by the very hard rock which was unexpectedly expensive to drill and mill. After the discovery of a new orebody in the Murphy Mine, the only significant producer, a revival followed beginning in 1872 and lasting into the 1880s. However, activity had largely ceased by 1890 and the post office closed in 1893.

Ruins of the mill and a brick-and-stone building that was probably the store still can be seen, as well as several roofless stone cabins. The portal of the Murphy Mine itself remains open, although entering it is hazardous. Unfortunately, several years ago the Forest Service razed some of the remaining stone buildings as public hazards.

After the turn of the last century, there was only small-scale and intermittent activity on precious metal extraction. In the mid-20th century, however, tungsten deposits were discovered and worked near the canyon mouth. This lasted until the mid-1960s when the tungsten market collapsed due to the removal of the strategic-metal subsidies.

Little is left of the tungsten operations. A mill for tungsten to the south of the canyon mouth survived till the early 2010s but has since been torn down. A cemetery from the early days is preserved on the north side of the canyon mouth.]]></summary>

An opening under the water allows sunlight to come up from below, illuminating the water and revealing the beautiful turquoise color you see throughout the Amalfi Coast. The effect is haunting and lovely.

Buy a ticket to Grotto dello Smeraldo in Amalfi, then take a boat from the Amalfi Harbor and disembark at the grotto shore; a guide in a large rowboat will give you a tour of the cave, pointing out interesting rock formations and, at the end, a small nativity scene that has been placed beneath the water by divers. The nativity is lit artificially from above, and looks quite creepy through the green water.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As you walk along Avenida de los Castillos in Alcorcón (south of Madrid) you will discover a set of 16 concrete sculptures created by Spanish sculptor Carlos Armiño which are the main decorative element of Parque de los Castillos. The collection is called El refugio de la vida (the shelter of life).

Armiño has his work on display in other parts of Alcorcón but it is here in the park that his best pieces can be admired together with the nearby Castillos de Valderas. Armiño spent months working on these pieces which were eventually acquired by the Alcorcón city council and carefully placed in the Parque de los Castillos in 2005.

Carlos Armiño began his artistic career as a painter before shifting his focus to sculpture, a task to which he has devoted himself for years. He masters different shapes depending on the materials he works with. Considering that these 16 pieces would have to endure the harshness of both summers and winters in this part of Madrid, he decided to use concrete for the pieces on display at this park in Alcorcón but he has also worked with iron and wood, the latter being his great passion.]]></summary>

In Europe, that imbalance is 10 to one: For every 10 streets named after men, there’s only one named after a woman. The most popular person in European street names is a woman, though: the Virgin Mary, in a wide variety of appellations.

146,000 Streets in 17 Countries

So says Mapping Diversity, a project that analyzes representation in street names across Europe. Its researchers analyzed close to 146,000 streets in 30 major cities across 17 European countries. More than one-third (nearly 53,000) were named after people, with just under 48,000 named after men, and just under 4,800 after women—less than 10 percent of all streets named after people. (About 0.5 percent were named after …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the buildings in Novi Beograd's Blok 28 were designed by architect Ilija Arnautović and constructed from 1970 to 1974. Among them are the two parallel apartment buildings known locally as the "TV set building" or "TV building," giving a loose translation. In you next venture to Belgrade's western neighborhood, you will not miss this gem when you are met with what looks like a gigantic beige wall with a sea of little TVs plastered to it.

Hilariously, on the creation of the building, Yugoslav president Tito expressed the following to Arnautovic: "I'm glad that you have decided not to build residential buildings higher than ten floors. This is good, because it is not easy for those who have to walk when the elevator breaks down. I am now also looking at those solitaires that have been built. There are very beautiful ones - most of them. There are also a few that, let me tell you, I don't like at all. For example, the ones with windows that look like a television." 

Today, the building is an object of debate amongst Belgraders. Some like it, some don't - the latter due to the fact that it looks especially cramped and uncomfortable to live in. Either way, Arnautovic's Blok 28 is home to a lot of unique buildings, with this one considered one of Novi Beograd's major symbols.]]></summary>

"Desire is nothing new,” says Michael Bronski, a historian at Harvard University and author of A Queer History of the United States. “There’s no reason to think that everything that happens now in terms of desire and sexual activity didn’t happen back then.” The challenge for historians is finding these long-lost stories—from times when society demanded they be hidden.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On November 19, 1985, the Geneva Summit brought President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev together for the first time. The leaders had gathered in Geneva to ease tensions, draft a roadmap for peace and future diplomacy, and, as Reagan suggested, to consider an alliance in case of an invasion by space aliens.

They had also gathered to eat. On the eve of November 20, a petite soufflé of lobster, suprême of chicken Périgourdine, and an endive salad with mousse de fromage and avocado preceded pear sorbet, petit fours, and coffee. Waiters walked the Summit dining room pouring a 1983 Silverado Chardonnay, a Stag’s Leap Cabernet Sauvignon of 1974, and, notably, a 1982 Iron Horse Blanc de Blanc to pair with each course. Ever since, every administration has poured…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cosmic Cavern has known many names: Moore's Cave, Mystery Cave, Maple Springs Cave, and Johnson Cave, to name a few. Stumbled upon in an attempt to mine lead, the cave was instead mined for calcite. (Model T Ford gear shifts were made of calcite from Cosmic Cavern.)

The cave contains many unique features, including the longest known soda straw in the Ozark Mountains, at nin feet long. One of the two bottomless lakes is the largest cave lake in the Ozarks. A cave diver attempted to find the bottom by throwing his air tank down a crevasse and shimmying further. While he survived the attempt, he did not manage to find the bottom, and no more cave dives were permitted.

But what makes the cave so unique is the secret area discovered in 1993 via dynamite. A hole in the cave suggested another room behind the end. This hypothesis was correct; the new chamber held untouched features and an additional bottomless lake. This makes a great comparison between what man's effect on the cave ecosystem looks like. The first part of the cave is covered in soot, invasive algae, and broken formations.  The new chamber is pristine, with some features completely transparent.]]></summary>

, a collaboration between folks at Ohio University and Argonne, is a neat combination of  and (-enabled) resonant x-ray absorption.  The authors bring an STM tip (an extremely sharp metal tip) down to within a nm of the sample surface, so that electrons can tunnel quantum mechanically from the sample to the tip.  Then bang the sample with x-rays that are resonant with core levels of particular atoms in the sample.  In this case, one sample consisted of iron-containing molecules.  The x-rays could kick electrons out of the iron atoms where they are then detected by the tip, allowing atomic-resolution mapping of the desired atoms.  (It's a bit more subtle than that - see Fig. 2j - but that's basically the gist.…]]></summary>

Recently celebrating its 25th anniversary, the garden was championed by the Friends of Mallory Square, and opened in September 1997 to celebrate the men and women who have had the greatest impact on Key West.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behind Fergusson College in Pune, there is a beautiful hill with lots of walking trails. The hill is called Fergusson Hill or Hanuman Tekdi, because there is a temple of Lord Hanuman on the top. A short distance from it, along the walking trail is an old stone monument that towers over the lush green landscape. The monument commemorates the establishment of The Servants of India Society on 12 June 1905 by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent leader, and social reformer.

Along with him were eminent citizens like Natesh Appaji Dravid, Gopal Krishna Deodhar, Surendra Nath Banerjee, Anant Patwardhan, and others. The purpose of starting this organization was to bring about social reforms in the country, thereby uplifting the people. The primary goal was the promotion of social and human development.

 The society was founded on the belief that for the development of the country, there should be a group of dedicated, selfless, and intelligent people who will dedicate their lives to the service of the nation. The society organized events and campaigns that focused on eradicating social evils like discrimination, oppression, poverty, domestic abuse, etc. There was an emphasis on nation-building activities such as education, sanitation, health care, upliftment of the underprivileged sections, etc. The society worked to unite people of different ethnicities and religions for welfare purposes.

In recent times, on the occasion of the centenary ceremony in 2005, the monument was renovated and a tree plantation drive was carried out. The monument stands as a proud reminder of the efforts taken by the citizens toward the betterment of society.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the small town of Cheverie, Nova Scotia, you will find an odd-looking brick structure near a salt marsh trail. This is the Camera Obscura which was built in 2012 by architecture students from Dalhousie Univerity.

The style of the structure is a construction technique called Guastavino, which is named after a Spanish architect from the late 19th century. And keeping consistent with that period, the camera uses the same "old" technology and works as it would have during that time.

The design of the exterior has three overlapping arches. Walking through the darker interior, you will see closed doors. This area is officially the large-scale pinhole camera, that you enter and close the doors behind you for the full effect. When you look up, there is a reflected and upside-down view of the cliffs across the water, and on the concrete floor below you is a real-time projection. 

The small community you drive through to get to the camera obscura is quite beautiful to pass and the structure itself is quite amazing to see.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not far from Ihk Tenger, the fenced-off Mongolian presidential palace, is a site of Bronze Age petroglyphs. These are barely visible on the rock cliffs, but you can climb up the stairs to get a closer look.

Motifs in Mongolian rock art include human figures that appear to morph into large winged birds, enclosures filled with dots, and horses traveling along trails. The rock art was first recorded by the Soviet scientist A.P. Okladnikov in 1960. In addition to the Bronze Age art, there are ink paintings that date back to the 13th century featuring inscriptions in Mongolian, Chinese, and Tibetan.

The other attraction here is the many ovoo, structures adorned with ceremonial silk scarves, or khadag. The ovoo are littered with offerings and represent a resurgence of traditional Mongolian shamanism.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even in the ritzy Ginza district of Tokyo, quaint Shinto shrines aren’t uncommon; most of them, however, are placed on the rooftops of tall department store buildings and can hardly be viewed from street level. Hōdō Inari Shrine is a rare exception, but it’s almost as hard to find—perhaps even harder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rain Westgard’s coworkers are emotionally needy, and she’s fine with that. They are also clever, gregarious, and can weigh upward of 5,000 pounds. As a rhino keeper at Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park near Orlando, Florida, it’s up to her to keep them physically fit, psychologically healthy, and otherwise entertained.

“There's a lot of job security with white rhinos,” says Westgard, who has worked with them at Disney for 10 years. “They require a lot of care.”

It’s also a weighty job. There are only 27,000 rhinos left on Earth, and three of the five species are considered critically endangered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one time Patricia Arquette actually tried to work for a private investigator, as a side hustle early in her acting career, her wire came loose and fell out. Years later, the Academy Award–winning actress is getting a second chance at the gig in High Desert, a comedy series that debuted May 17, 2023, on Apple TV+. In High Desert, Arquette plays Peggy Newman, a former drug dealer–turned–Pioneertown Old West reenactor. Faced with foreclosure on her late mother’s home, Peggy starts moonlighting as a gumshoe, scaling the titular region of Southern California in search of curious clues to peculiar cases—all while fighting her own battle with addiction and mourning the loss of her mother. It’s funny, poignant, and, like the High Desert itself, just the right amount of weird.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your first clue that Redheaded Stranger is no ordinary taco joint is perched on a corner barstool. He’s a giant stuffed giraffe with braided pigtails and a T-shirt that reads “NO FUCKIN’ CHIPS,” and his name is Willie—in honor of Mr. Nelson, of course.

Your second clue is that for years, the not-so-secret order here was the Crunchwrap. “My mom's favorite restaurant is Taco Bell, so I grew up eating a lot of [Crunchwrap Supremes],” says chef Bryan Lee Weaver. The restaurant initially kept it off the official menu out of low-key fear of litigation.

“We ran it as a special and it sold like crazy, so we just kind of kept doing it.” Unlike the fast-food iteration, Redheaded Stranger’s versions include fillings like house-made green chile pork and whipped feta.

Sometime between then and today, the city’s Broadway took a turn for the wild. Nowadays, most locals give the neon-drenched street a wide berth and complain that the area has become something of a parody of itself—a relentless bachelorette party and booze-fueled musical carnival, all rolled into one strip. 

Come nightfall, “Nashvegas” fills with roving packs of women donning sashes, cowgirl boots, and hats. Many of the bar-venues boast a loose celebrity tie-in, from Justin Timberlake’s Twelve Thirty Club to Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville to Kid Rock’s thunderous, multistory Big A** Honky Tonk Rock N’ Roll Steakhouse.

Opened in the fall of 1994, this oddity in Ottawa's Wellington West shopping district has been helping adventurers not die while doing awesome (dangerous, fantastic) things for almost 30 years. Long enough, in fact, to be one of the first small businesses in Ottawa to have an online presence.

World of Maps supplies travelers and curious minds with early cartographic facsimiles, maps of the Milky Way galaxy, and even a flat-earth map for those always questioning reality. A sliding wall showcases the most popular maps for easy perusing.

Maps aren't the only treasures to find inside. Shelves are teeming with books on niche topics like ink-making, foraging, and how to read the night sky, while funky globes spin and illuminate the shop beside old-style navigational tools like compasses, sextants, and "the eye of time." Even professionals can find something inside, with air and nautical charts, logbooks, and topographic maps.

Really just a great place to get lost in.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep in the far east of Catholic Poland are two historically Muslim villages with histories dating back to the Middle Ages. Kruszyniany and its smaller sister village, Bohoniki, are the last Polish villages still inhabited by the Lipka Tatars, a Muslim Turkic people who originally came to Europe in the 1200s. The Tatars joined the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in every major military campaign of the time, notably the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, and as a reward for their loyalty, the Tatars were granted the right to settle in eastern Poland.

Over the centuries, the Tatars adopted the Polish language and integrated into Polish society while maintaining their distinct religious and cultural identity. Despite their religious differences with the Polish state, they were considered full citizens who had earned their place in Polish society on the battlefield. After World War II, however, the resulting border shifts in Eastern Europe resulted in these Tatar communities being splintered between Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus, with only the villages of Kruszyniany and Bohoniki remaining within Polish borders.

Today, Kruszyniany is the center of Poland's original Tatar community, and its modest yet impressive Green Mosque attracts visitors from all over the country who are interested in learning more about Poland's Muslim minority. The mosque is maintained by descendants of the original Lipka Tatars who are enthusiastic about sharing their unique history and culture with their fellow Poles and with the rest of the world. Across the street is also a restaurant (Tatarska Jurta) serving traditional Tatar cuisine with English- and Polish-language descriptions of Tatar dishes.

Kruszyniany's smaller sister village of Bohoniki, about 30km to the north, also boasts a traditional wooden mosque maintained by Tatar-descended locals who are happy to explain their history and religious customs to curious visitors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most denizens of the summer night sky are easy to find: There’s the bright stars Vega and Arcturus, the constellation Cygnus the Swan, the Big Dipper. But one of my favorites is a little harder to see, and worth the effort and the small amount of equipment you’ll need to do it. The Beehive Cluster, also known as M44, is as much a harbinger of summer as the sound of wind chimes and katydid calls.

This week, the Beehive is joined by the planet Venus, shining bright in the western sky after sunset. The pairing is a great introduction to celestial companions you might not otherwise see—and to some equipment you might want for the rest of your summer stargazing.

The Beehive Cluster is found in the constellation Cancer the Crab, in its “chest,” according to Ptolemy. It is also known as Praes…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Botanical Gardens of Paris are full of meticulously sculpted but ominous statues, such as that of the lion devouring a child. Created by the same sculptor or animalier, Emmanuel Frémiet, Dénicheur d’Oursons is another, and perhaps even more brutal example of this trend.

At first glance, it seems like a heroic statue of a mostly-naked huntsman wrestling with a ferocious bear in an almost Herculean manner, but if you look closer at it, you’ll notice a grotesque trophy hanging from the hunter’s belt: a dead cub. Once it’s been noticed, the implication is clear. The human invader murdered the mother bear’s little baby, and she is attacking the man in fury.

The huntsman has stabbed the bear in the neck, but it does not seem to stop the maddened animal. The strength put into its bearhug is deadly—and the "cub snatcher" hangs loose in its arms, facing the same fate he forced the poor child into. It's all very realistic despite its dramatic nature, from the man's musculature to the bear's furious fur.]]></summary>

Christianity appropriated the symbol around 324, when the first known labyrinth appeared in a cathedral in Algeria. The intricate designs, which vary from church to church, are thought to represent an internal pilgrimage.

The Womanspace labyrinth and gardens are free and open to the public daily during daylight hours. The 11-circuit design is modeled after the Chartres Cathedral labyrinth in France. Its many turns reflect the journey of life, with its change and transition, rites of passage, and cycles of nature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An avid baker and native of Grand Isle, Vermont, Donna Sue Shaw started to offer homemade treats to the public from a shed in her front yard during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was Shaw's hope that passersby would use the shed as a place to stop and refuel as they traveled along the bike trail that traverses the island. Although she initially envisioned the bakery as a diversion, her pies were so good that it quickly became a destination in and of itself. 

Shaw sources most of her ingredients locally and sells her wares on an honor system. There is no cash register, rather a paper log, Venmo QR codes, and a bird house where you can leave cash to pay for whatever you take. Along with sweet and savory pies, she sells granola, local maple syrup, cookies, scones and cakes, all made from scratch in her home kitchen.]]></summary>

Measuring around 12 feet long, five feet wide, and five feet deep, the Doctor’s Bath could accommodate several patients at any one time. It features a number of channels that allow the basin to fill up with seawater when the tide reached a certain level, before the water actually got as high as the bath itself. 

Thalassotherapy, or seawater therapy, became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Swimming or wading in the ocean, seawater pools, and heated saltwater baths were common.]]></summary>

The gallery was designed by architects Jim Torosyan, Aslan Mkhitaryan, and Sargis Gurzadyanand. The first part was built in 1971-1980, the second in 2002, and additional elements are still in process. In front of the gallery is a cozy park with statues, where you can just sit and enjoy the art around you or visit one of many cafés around this magicial place.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Theatro Municipal de São Paulo, or the Municipal Theater of São Paulo, is located in the city center of Brazil's largest city. In the early 20th century, the elites of São Paulo wanted a venue to welcome the greatest performers of the day, from opera sopranos to ballet dancers. The Theater was, and still is, one of the main architectural and cultural landmarks in the city.

Construction on the building began in 1903 and its design was largely inspired by the Opera Garnier in Paris. Architect Ramos de Azevedo designed the massive theater with the help of Italian architects Cláudio Rossi and Domiziano Rossi. The theater eventually opened eight years later in 1911, and today is located in the city center, next to the Anhangabaú Valley.

Later, the Carthaginians made the island their base of operations for the conquest of ancient Hispania. Both the Phoenicians and Carthaginians buried their dead in places not far from their settlements. So while the walled city of the living grew,  today known as Dalt Vila, some 550 yards away on the nearby hill of Puig des Molins, the city's necropolis also grew. The name Puig des Molins can be loosely translated to "Windmill Hill," so called because windmills covered the hill as far back as the 15th century.

Today, the Puig de Molins Necropolis archaeological complex is adjacent to an accompanying museum highlighting the site's history. The necropolis is one of the largest in the Mediterranean. Estim…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Clifton Suspension Bridge is one of Bristol's most recognizable landmarks, but not many of the people who walk across it don't know about the 12 vaulted chambers hidden below the Leigh Woods Tower.

In 1831, the young engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel was awarded the contract to build the Clifton Suspension Bridge, intended to be the highest and longest bridge in the world. Immediately, the project was plagued by problems and was eventually abandoned altogether in 1853. Brunel died in 1859, leaving the bridge only half completed. His plans and drawings of the Leigh Woods abutment were lost, and the 12 enormous vaulted chambers inside were forgotten. 

The bridge was later completed in 1864, but it wasn't until the early 21st century that the chambers were rediscovered. A builder carrying out some repairs on the bridge found the mysterious vaults in 2002.

Today, the vaults are now open to visitors between April and October each year. Two of the biggest chambers can be explored as part of a guided visit, where it is possible to see stalactites almost 23 feet long and squeeze through a small passageway into an enormous cathedral-style hall with amazing echoing acoustics.]]></summary>

Thanks David!

About the Schubert calculus:  you won't be surprised that this is how I came to think about this.

And about the new notation:  I'm sold, and I've made the change.  (In the process, I noticed a number of small mistakes.)    I had earlier learned from you the importance of wisely choosing names and notation, and this very much applies here.]]></summary>

You are right!  The source of my cognitive error is that I wrote those complexes with subscripts rather than superscripts (for which the convention is that the d's would be *decreasing*, but I didn't say that).  I've now fixed it, by (i) making the subscripts superscripts as they should have been, and then (ii) having w degree-decreasing as you said.  Thanks!]]></summary>

The seating area was carved on-site in 1810 by convicted laborers. It was created for Elizabeth Henrietta Macquarie, the wife of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, who served as Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821.

Perched at the end of the peninsula that became known as Mrs. Macquarie's Point, it was a frequent resting spot for the Governor's wife.

The pliability of churned, frozen cream makes it a great raw material to build upon—whether it’s covered in torched meringue to form a spiky, flaming mountain in Baked Alaska or shaped into a bombe floating in a sea of blackberry sauce to evoke a luminous, floating moon in Clair de Lune.
Beyond ice cream’s shape-shifting abilities, it can also hold seemingly endless colors and flavors. I’ve had purple ube ice cream, red bean ice cream—both delicious—and even an unfortunate batch of cream-colored, wiener-studded Nathan’s hot dog–flavored ice cream that I can’t in good conscience recommend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This small but mighty waterfall is located in the rugged rainforest of the Catlins Conservation Park, deep in the south of New Zealand. It's off the beaten track adventure and a must-see in the region.

Although Koropuku Falls is marked on local maps, the unofficial Koropuku Falls Walk that brings you to the base is listed only on a select few. And it’s not only the fantastic view of the waterfall that makes this area worth visiting, it’s the walk itself. 

Many walking tracks in New Zealand are constructed and maintained by the Department of Conservation (DOC), and must meet a standard width for consistency. But here, you'll be walking single file as the winding path meanders intimately through the bush, bringing you up close and personal with the best of NZ native fauna and flora. 

Lush ferns, mosses, lichens and native birdlife are abundant, even the tracks footing is made from pungas (native tree ferns) or nearby rocks from the stream. This magical walk offers a chance to experience being part of the bush, without disrupting the surrounding area. 

The unique track was hand-made by two local men, Wayne and Peter, and is a labor of love spanning over 20 years. There is even a bench dedicated to their wives for the amount of time they've spent here. They still maintain the track to ensure safety and enjoyment. 

The Catlins region has a rich Māori history, with abundant fresh seafood and forest food sources being a draw card for the first Polynesians. The remnants of their habitation are still found in the place names. In te reo Māori, Koropuku means lump or swelling.

The good news is you can walk the track any time of the year. It offers a refreshing walk in the cooler months, or a reprieve from the heat in the warmer weather, with a secret beach and swimming area at the base of the waterfall.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Victorian era, a stint inside Ruthin Gaol was a fate close to death. Today, a visit serves as the perfect afternoon for fans of the macabre.

Ruthin Gaol was built in the late 18th century to replace a smaller "correction center" that was forced to modernize because conditions were so poor. It was expanded over the years and continued to function as a prison until 1916. After, the site became a makeshift munitions factory during World War II before eventually being partially converted into a public library and office space. Today, a large chunk of the building serves as the only purpose-built Pentonville-style prison (a prison that focused on isolating inmates in individual cells) open to the public as a heritage attraction.

Visitors are free to explore the cramped cells, where inmates spent the vast majority of their days alone, and witness the various forms of punishments dolled out for bad behavior. These ranged from a stint in the dark cell to a machine with a crank-shaft handle that prisoners were forced to turn thousands of times, despite it not actually serving any purpose.

Visitors will also learn stories about some of those who once inhabited these walls.]]></summary>

The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”]]></title>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Garza (Crane) surname is one of the most representatives of the Northern Mexican city of Monterrey and its metropolitan area, the country's second most-populated. This can be seen in the municipalities of San Nicolás de los Garza and San Pedro Garza García.

Many families originating in Monterrey, therefore, share the Garza name, and it was one of these that established Xicotepec's first permanent cinema, the Cine Garza. Monterrey is the capital of the state of Nuevo León, so the seal of this state was prominently added to the facade of the theater. The cinema started its operations in the 1950s, while three decades later, in 1986, a restaurant called La Choza (The Hut) also opened in the town.

In the mid-2000s, after the Cine Garza lay abandoned for a few years, La Choza occupied the building, where it is still located as of early 2023. The cinema's lobby is now the restaurant's waiting area, all seating was removed to make way for the tables and chairs, leaving the stage where the screen was located as the main architectural heritage is still present in the restaurant.

The stage is still used for the occasional show as well as events such as book presentations. For the most part, however, it is merely a decorated feature that diners can enjoy while tasting some of the local Xicotepense delicacies served here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away in one of Adelaide’s side streets lies the Royal Instituttion, formerly the Adelaide Stock Exchange. Within its walls is something that is often walked passed, missed, or forgotten about. Upon arrival at the Royal Institute, enter through the front entryway, turn to your left, and walk towards the main staircase. Atop the staircase is the oldest and perhaps the most valuable Morris & Co. stained glass work in Adelaide, also the only Morris & Co. stained glass window not within a religious building in Adelaide, which is often referred to as the “City of Churches.”

William Morris famously known for his London-based textile company, Morris & Co., was commissioned for several stained glass windows for the city of Adelaide. Almost all of them were located within churches and commissioned for religious reasoning. His work within the Royal Institute remains as one of his most valuable works to date, somehow surviving two fires during the 20th century, in 1938 and 1982 respectively, the stained glass window still stands in the main stairwell where it was originally commissioned.

The window was commissioned by Sir George. A. Brookman, an early mining mogul of South Australia and Western Australia, to commemorate the Australian Federation, an important moment in Australian history, in which the Australian colonies were joined together as a nation in 1901.

The window features six stained glass panels, with the lower three depicting the British Empire. Life-sized figures represent Australia and India on the left-hand side, Africa and Canada on the right, and Britannia in the center. Based on designs by British painter, Edward Byrne-Jones, a painter, designer and a founding partner of Morris & Co., the three upper panels represent morning, noon and evening. Upon closer inspection you’ll notice the central figure of Britannia is holding a wreath that frames the word ‘FEDERATION’, a nod to when the window was made.]]></summary>

Beyond the metropolis, the Sierra Madre Mountain range surrounds the city, including the famous El Cerro de la Silla, a hill shaped like a horse saddle. 

Mother nature's creations and man-made inventions influence the city below. However, there is one imposing figure whose inception is a little more unclear, perhaps the most revered of them all, and the mother of all Mexico's mothers: a 40-foot-tall sculpture of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

At her feet lie flowers and other tributes by those who have come to pay their respects. Onlooking drivers see her as they pass by on the busy main avenue where she stands. Immediately behind her, in line with the traffic, t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Poem Tree stood, for close to 450 years, on Castle Hill, at Oxfordshire’s Wittenham Clumps. In the 1840s, the tree was furnished with a carving by Joseph Tubb who etched the words of his 20-line poem into the beech.

As up the hill with labr'ing steps we tread / Where the twin Clumps their sheltering branches spread / The summit gain'd at ease reclining lay / And all around the wide spread scene survey / Point out each object and instructive tell / The various changes that the land befell / Where the low bank the country wide surrounds / That ancient earthwork form'd old Mercia's bounds / In misty distance see the barrow heave / There lies forgotten lonely Cwichelm's grave.

Around this hill the ruthless Danes intrenched / And these fair plains with gory slaughter drench'd / While at our feet where stands that stately tower / In days gone by up rose the Roman power / And yonder, there where Thames smooth waters glide / In later days appeared monastic pride. / Within that field where lies the grazing herd / Huge walls were found, some coffins disinter'd / Such is the course of time, the wreck which fate / And awful doom award the earthly great.

Inspired by his admiration for the surrounding landscape and its history, the careful process of carving this poem, from memory no less, is said to have taken Tubbs two weeks over the summer.

Though already 300 years old at the time of Tubb’s carving, the tree’s continued growth and development caused the poem to slowly become distorted as the years passed. With the foresight to know this unique poem had little time of legibility left, Henry Osmaston, a geographer in the area, took a rubbing in 1965 for posterity.

This rubbing was later recreated, alongside a transcription of the poem, on a stone close to the tree. Though placed in 1994 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the carving, the stone now stands as a memorial to the lost tree and poem, since the beech collapsed in 2012.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Small Shinto shrines aren’t a rare sight in the streets of Japan, typically consisting of a torii arch, an offertory box, and nothing much more. At first glance, Takao Inari Shrine in the Nihonbashi-Hakozakicho district of Tokyo seems like one of such shrines, with no attending priests, no amulets nor fortune slips to be seen, which are otherwise common in places of Shinto worship.

Nearly blending into the wall of an office building, the inconspicuous shrine recently underwent refurbishment work and boasts an ultra-modern, almost LEGO-like torii arch made out of a steel frame, as well as a painting of colorful clouds on the ceiling. The small sanctuary in the center is guarded by statuettes of kitsune, foxes serving the god of prosperity, Inari.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[San Pedro de Rocas is a fascinating and historic monastery in Galicia, Spain with a rich history that spans more than a millennium. The structure is a stunning example of ancient monastic architecture and dates back to the 6th century. Situated in a remote forested valley near the town of Esgos, the monastery's founding is shrouded in mystery. According to an inscription on a stone recording the monastery's founding, a group of religious men founded the monastery in 573. The monastery has also been linked to a Spanish knight named Gemodus, who, in the 9th century, is said to have revived the religious center. 

Since the 6th century, the monastery has undergone many changes and additions, becoming a vital center of religious and cultural life in the region for many centuries. The monastery is famous for its rock-cut architecture and intricate carvings, which are considered some of the finest examples of Romanesque art in Galicia.

One of the most intriguing features of San Pedro de Rocas is the tiny, rock-cut burial niches carved into the walls.  Another highlight is a faded fresco of a world map featuring the apostles. Located in the church, the map depicts the known world in the late 13th century. The fresco has been dated between 1175 and 1200. A unique example of medieval art, the map is said to share similar cosmological views with the maps seen in contemporary medieval manuscripts. The fresco is a remarkable work of art and a testament to the importance of San Pedro de Rocas in medieval Europe.

Visitors can explore the site, which includes a church, cloister, and living quarters, as well as a nearby museum that showcases the history and culture of the region. San Pedro de Rocas is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in architecture, history, or religious art.]]></summary>

The Scientists Coaxing Back Nature with Sound

by Katherine Latham, BBC Future

Palmyra Atoll, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, is a quiet place—too quiet. Eight vital species of seabirds disappeared from the island when it was overrun by rats. Now scientists hope to lure the birds back with a continuous soundtrack of familiar bird songs, one of many such efforts to use sound to restore the natural world. "Healthy island ecosystems are deafening," Alex Wegmann, lead scientist for The Nature Conservancy, told BBC Future. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Northern Albanians once lived by their own tribal code according to the Kanun, a set of customary laws established by the Kanun of Leke Dukagjini, a 15th-century nobleman. Among its 1,262 articles, the Kanun permits blood feuds (gjakmarrja), in which a person is entitled to "an eye for an eye" in the form of murder as retribution for killing or dishonoring a family member in the name of justice. It was not uncommon for these feuds to last years, spanning several generations and resulting in the deaths of multiple men—and sometimes even women and children as collateral damage—on both sides.

Beyond the Middle Ages, Kanun law persisted in parts of Albania, despite being outlawed by communist dictator Enver Hoxha. To this day, scattered blood feuds reportedly still exist, with some individuals isolating themselves at home in their villages, living in constant fear of eventual retaliation by a family scorned long ago by one of their ancestors. 

During feuds, male family members would confine themselves in towers called kullas to give themselves a defensive advantage over the opposing clan. The men would remain here until the ensuing feud was over, that is, until all males who posed a direct threat were killed, or until reconciliation was achieved, possibly with the help of a council of elders.

The kulla is located just off the main road in Theth, beyond the lineup of guesthouses. There are no designated opening hours, but locals in one of the neighboring houses will open the tower on request. At the time of writing, the admission fee is 200 leke.]]></summary>

Fakes are quite prevalent in those places, poorly made and artificially aged, and not only that, far more expensive than they should be. When it comes to ancient ceramics in Hội An, Vietnam, however, you may rest assured that you're in good hands. Not only are they genuine pieces of 15th-century China, but they also come with an intriguing provenance.

Located a little off the bustling streets of Hoi An Ancient Town, Nam Trân is a small family-run shop that offers a wide array of antique ceramics, particularly those recovered from a local shipwreck, which still lies about 25 miles off the coast.

        <updated>2023-06-09T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revered poet Antonio Machado was a member of a group of Spanish writers conventionally known as Generation of ‘98, influenced by the grim social and cultural ramifications of the historical crisis caused by the Spanish defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898, which changed the shape of the world at large, including the United States of America as we know them.

Between 1919 and 1932, a few years before the eruption of the Spanish Civil War, Machado spent time in Segovia as a French teacher while he wrote controversial letters to a mystery lady, or maybe not such a mystery! Most claim that it was always postmodernist poet and playwright Pilar de Valderrama, whom he addressed as “Guiomar.”

Today, Segovia’s visitors can explore the curiosities that still inhabit the hostel/apartment Machado rented during those late years. The home is also quintessential of the Castilian lifestyle in provincial towns at the time. It's a multi-sensory experience that combines the traditional smell of old local wood exposed to the seasonal rigors, vintage books (including all Antonio Machado’s works in their original Spanish versions as well as translations into other languages), and reminiscent fabrics, all of it inundated with sunlight coming from every corner of the extremely narrow space.]]></summary>

Enter Turquet’s octopus (Pareledone turqueti), a cephalopod with a four-million-year pedigree that makes its home in the icy waters around Antarctica. Recent DNA analysis shows that two distinct populations of this species, one in the Weddell Sea and the other in the Ross Sea, mated about 125,000 years ago.

This could only have happened if the massive ice sheet that now separates those populations wasn’t there at the time. So yes, it did collapse. And that’s bad news, because it increases the likelihood that it will happen again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 19th century, James Braidwood established what many believe to be the first firefighting brigade in Britain. Because of haphazard and shoddy architectural construction, Edinburgh was prone to constant outbreaks of fires. In 1824, the city fell victim to two such infernos that decimated large portions of the Old Town. Braidwood was appointed by the city council to spearhead what was to become the world's first municipal fire department.

At the age of 24, he was already working as a firefighter, driving the engines that were employed to put out fires. He also worked as a surveyor, giving him expertise in building materials and construction that allowed him to incorporate this knowledge into new fire-fighting techniques. In his capacity as a fire chief, he hired men who had experience working in the fields of building manufacturing, as well as mariners. Both professions had an understanding and practicality that could be incorporated into fire-fighting techniques that are still utilized today.

Unfortunately, he was killed while fighting a fire in his new home in London. In 2008, a statue was erected in the city of his birth, not far from the site of one of the city's most disastrous fires and home to the first fire station. The monument was created by Glaswegian sculptor, Kenneth Mackay, and a plaque reads:

"This statue is dedicated to the memory of James Braidwood, a pioneer of the scientific approach to fire-fighting. It also recognizes the courage and sacrifice of fire-fighters, not only in Lothian & Borders Fire and Rescue Service, but all over the world."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are days when Amadou Ly barely sees the sun. ALF Bakery, located on the subterranean level of Manhattan’s Chelsea Market, opens at 9:00 a.m., but Ly’s day starts hours earlier, in the dark, in his glass-walled work station in front of a piano-sized machine called a dough sheeter.

Lamination, the practice of incorporating layers upon layers of whisper-thin butter into dough, is at the core of much of what Ly does—and it is not a process that can be rushed. Invented in Austria as early as the 13th century, laminated dough took Paris by storm in 1839, when a Viennese artillery officer by the name of August Zang set up a bakery in France. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, humidity, or timing can ruin a batch of croissants in an instant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few sights are as mesmerizing as that of bakers methodically rolling fresh croissants each morning in this glass-encased kitchen hidden in the lower level of Chelsea Market. As with the best Parisian bakeries, ALF releases fresh batches of pastries and breads throughout the day, meaning the kitchen team works near ceaselessly from before dawn until after the bakery closes at 6 p.m.

New York has no shortage of bakeries, but none are quite like this one. In a landscape dominated by brand-name bakers who churn out thousands of loaves, ALF Bakery—short for “Amadou Ly Fancy Bakery”—is a scrappy, independent operation whipping up absurdly high-level baked goods.

The mastermind behind it all is Amadou Ly, who originally hails from Senegal and Togo, journeyed to Barcelona to study chocolate, P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Video Games, a defunct casino building, definitely stands out in its environment. The castle features a stone exterior, an arched wooden door, a looming knight statue, turrets, and other cliché castle features. Even in its decades-long stretch into neglect, it’s standing strong, and it holds a kind of kitschy allure in its rural South Carolina surroundings. Located right off the highway in the tiny, unassuming town of Blacksburg, South Carolina, it's a weird setting for an even weirder story behind the Castle Video Games building.

Gambling was supposed to be illegal in South Carolina. In fact, gambling was clearly banned in South Carolina, in written law, since 1802. But in 1986, a scheming politician snuck an amendment into a bill that very subtly made gambling legal through the permission of video gambling. Apparently, the state itself didn’t even realize that this had happened until three years later, in 1989. 

Naturally, upon realizing that gambling was accidentally legal again, the early 1990s saw a boom in video poker. Gambling arcades popped up all around South Carolina, located conveniently close to state lines (across which gambling was still actually illegal). Video poker machines were everywhere during this time—you could find people chasing losses in restaurants, gas stations, bowling alleys, and corner stores.

But, of course, all good things must come to an end. In 1999, the South Carolina Supreme Court canceled video poker and banned gambling (again). At the time, it was reportedly a $2.8 billion industry. And just like that, the lights went out at Blacksburg's Castle Video Games. The castle is still there, in pretty great condition, serving as a weird reminder of the time when video poker reigned supreme over the state of South Carolina.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just west of Glasgow's centrally located George Square and City Chambers (where you can visit the building's ornate, marble-clad staircase) is the Merchant City neighborhood. The 30-square-block neighborhood is bounded by Ingram Street to Argyle Street and Queen Street to High Street. Architecturally, the neighborhood is most known for its former 18th- and 19th-century warehouse buildings that have now mostly been refurbished into boutique hotels and upscale retail shops.

In Merchant City, at the intersection of John and Ingram Streets, sits a towering white building known as Hutchesons' Hall. This building once served as both a hospital and school for boys and is named after the two brothers, George and Thomas Hutcheson, who founded it toward the middle of the 1600s. The likelinesses of the two brothers can be found at the entrance of the building. Most local residents, as well as visitors, wouldn't know that these statues have been accidentally switched!

The mix-up happened when the building was undergoing renovation at the beginning of the 1800s. During the construction project, the statues were put into storage. Once the renovation was completed, the best were dusted off and reinstated. But unbeknownst to the workers, the two brothers were returned to the incorrect plinth.

This was not the only error the builders made. George Hutcheson the elder brother was born in 1580 and died in 1639. Unfortunately, a mathematical error was made and the date of his passing was inscribed as 1663—miscalculating his age by nearly three decades! Even though these blunders have been identified, they remain uncorrected to this day.]]></summary>

What about those giant fruits you spot from the bus on the main road of Konagi in Japan? Or the whimsical tin horses that gallop alongside a highway in Western Australia? Destinations are great, but summer road trips are made all the more memorable by the head-turning wonders along the way: outrageously big objects, mesmerizing gas stations, puzzling signs, and more. You may stop for a closer look, you may not, but you won’t forget the sight.

There are headstones dedicated to people who died of old age, disease, war, accidents, and other tragic circumstances. But, in the Church Hill Cemetery in Framingham, Massachusetts, there is one remarkably unusual grave that's dedicated to two men from the 18th century who were both killed after being struck by lightning at the exact same time.

There is not much information regarding the backgrounds of John Cloyce and Abraham Rice but it is known that Rice was a Cornet in the British colonial cavalry before the time of his death. According to accounts, on June 3, 1777, several men congregated around a metal fence to see a horse that a local Framingham preacher, Peter Parker, was interested in purchasing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the southeast corner of Spain, the small city of Elche in the province of Alicante is famous for the UNESCO-inscribed Palmeral of Elche, a 10th-century manmade oasis that boasts some 45,000 date palms spread out between 67 orchards. But the Palmeral oasis is far from the only wonder the medieval Arab inhabitants of Elche left behind. Nestled in the city's center, buried underground is an elaborate medieval bath complex known as the Arab Baths (Baños Árabes) or Hammam.

While it's not the only bath complex in Elche, the Arab Baths (built around 1150) are the most remarkable and important in the city, situated close to the medieval mosque and main gate of the town. Today, the baths are located beneath the La Merced Convent (or "Convento de la Merced"), which Clarissa nuns occupied until the city moved the sister into a new convent in 2004.

Since the 13th century, the baths have been repurposed many times. Most recently, the sisters housed a convent store and storage room in the medieval baths. Despite this, the bath themselves have remained remarkably unaltered and are a rare architectural example of Islamic public buildings from the former Islamic territory of Al-Andalus.]]></summary>

The display pool harnesses one of the many hot springs in the area. Gently spilling over a moss-covered rock hill, the water steams into a touch pool, where one can feel the heat of the springs.

The 147 degrees Fahrenheit means the water must be tempered in a bathhouse before bathing. Past the display spring, and up above the bathhouse row, the Hot Water Cascade violently gushes on the side of a cliff. 

Both cascades are must-sees at the national park.  One can even collect the spring water from one of the many public fountains, some tempered, to drink later. Many think the 4,000-year-old water has healing powers.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 30, 1999, the people of Minsk gathered by the Svisloch River for a festive event commemorating the second anniversary of the Mir radio station, featuring a concert by Mango-Mango. 

However, a thunderstorm erupted accompanied by heavy hail. In a rush to seek shelter from the weather, around 2,500 young individuals, crowded into the underpass of the Nemiga metro station. Poor design and the absence of handrails led to individuals slipping on wet tiles. Unaware of the unfolding danger, the pushing crowd sparked a stampede, with the intervening policemen only managing to stop a portion of the crowd.

The stampede resulted in the tragic loss of 53 lives, including two heroic police officers, Foreman Vladimir Govin and Senior Sergeant Gennady Ryabokon. Additionally, over 250 people suffered injuries of varying severity. 

In remembrance of the lives lost in the stampede, a memorial was built outside the Nyamiha metro station. The memorial is a symbol of collective mourning and a solemn dedication to never forget the lives tragically taken too soon. It offers a place for contemplation and paying respects to the victims.]]></summary>

This episode of The Atlas Obscura Podcast transports listeners to the historic Tabor Opera House in Leadville, Colorado. Today, Colorado is a hub for music and performance, but long before anyone appeared live at Red Rocks or made The Fillmore shake, there was the Tabor – which not only staged high dramas, tragedies, and tales of star-crossed lovers…it also inspired an opera of its own.

Host Dylan Thuras explores the story of the Tabor’s enigmatic founder, Horace Tabor, who went from rags to riches in the blink of an eye thanks to the Colorado Silver Boom. Tabor’s meteoric rise brought wealth, political power, and a scandalous love affair with a divorcee 24 years his junior, the famed beauty Elizabeth “Baby Doe” McCourt. But it all came crashing down as quickly as it began, when Horace – and Baby Doe – lost everything, were forced to sell the Tabor Opera House, and died penniless.

Decades later, when the Opera House was threatened with destruction, a Leadville woman named Evelyn Furman came to its rescue, preserving the theater for future generations. Furman also introduced the theater and its fascinating “ghosts” to two American songwriters, who were inspired by the Tabors’ story to pen the opera “The Ballad of Baby Doe.” “The Ballad of Baby Doe” has since become one of the most popularly performed American operas, and the Tabor Opera House – today undergoing extensive renovation – continues to inspire.]]></summary>

So, when he recently glimpsed a very large, rare Wels catfish in the waterways of Utrecht, a small city 25 miles south of Amsterdam, van Rooijen felt some of the old excitement of reeling in a big catch.

This time, though, instead of hauling the trophy fish to shore, van Rooijen courteously rang a virtual “doorbell” on the catfish’s behalf, prompting a worker to open a canal lock and allowing the fish to pass through the waterway unscathed. van Rooijen will do this repeatedly throughout the spring and summer months, and sometimes he’ll go onto Facebook to tell his friends about it. These days, it's safe to say van Rooijen is the one who is hooked…]]></summary>

Singular not only on Pinta but the planet, this last of the Chelonoidis niger abingdonii was dubbed “Lonesome George” and transported to the Charles Darwin Research Station on the nearby island of Santa Cruz, for the safety of the individual and with the aspiration to preserve the subspecies.

Over decades, George was monitored by multiple teams of scientists and tended by park ranger Fausto Llerana; in 1983 Llerana, who had developed a passion for tortoises as an adolescent, became the tortoise's primary caregiv…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/silver-sands-nashville"/>
        <updated>2023-06-07T21:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For more than 70 years, regulars have been lining up here five days a week from morning until the tail-end of lunchtime for the classic meat-and-three. Sophia Vaughn, the third woman in her family to run the place, makes everything from scratch daily. Offerings vary depending on the day of the week, but always consist of soul food classics, made with immense care. 

By her own account, Vaughn wakes up at 2 a.m. and starts cooking an hour later in order to have everything ready for the first breakfast customers. Silver Sands Cafe has weathered more than its share over the years, including a tornado in March 2020 that threatened to put it out of business right as the COVID-19 pandemic ramped up. An outpouring of support from the local community helped keep the restaurant afloat.

While part of that loyalty is due to Vaughn, who calls customers her “babies” and knows many by name, much of it is simply because the food is phenomenal. Chitterlings, neck bones, pig’s feet, and other slow-braised cuts are front and center here, along with pork chops, fried catfish, and other rib-sticking fare. The oxtails are tender enough to yield to the gentlest tap of a plastic fork and come swimming in a deeply savory, collagen-rich gravy. 

Don’t sleep on any of the sides, from the collards speckled with generous shards of ham hock to the slightly sticky, impeccably cooked okra to the mac n’ cheese, which has just the right kick of sharp cheddar. After you’ve crafted a plate with a main meat with two sides, they'll ask if you want “hot water” or “flat,” which refers to two different types of cornbread—the former is a torpedo-shaped, skillet-fried cornmeal dumpling; the latter is an oven-baked buttermilk cornbread.

Pay at the front to receive your parcel of treasure, then grab a booth and obliterate it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The M/V Sophie C. makes its waterfront deliveries to the residents of New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee every mail season since 1892, which only lasts from June to September. The seasonal homes across the eight islands are typically starting to close after Labor Day, so the mailboat doesn't have to worry about issues with lake ice.

The mail boat first launched in 1945, and was named after the owner of the Winnipesaukee Flagship Corporation's mother. In 1969, the Sophie C took over the seasonal postal route charged with delivering mail to residents on the western side of Winnipesaukee. 

The Sophie C. stops at Weirs Beach twice a day for passengers and cargo. On the boat, you can purchase historically authentic postage stamps, depicting the vessels. Bear Island has its own outpost on a channel, where the mailboat can be spotted and traditionally waved to as it passes through.

The big sibling vessel to the Sophie C, the well-known Mount Washington Ferry, was used in 1945 by the U.S. Navy in World War II. The Boston Ship amd Engine Works built the Sophie C to temporarily fulfill the need for a ferry service, then adopted the permanent mail route when the Mount Washington returned from its military application.]]></summary>

Some people speak of the night as the time when the stars come out. But they are always out. We are always surrounded by them and among them, even though the star closest to us, the sun, outshines them. I prefer to think of the night as the time when the sun lets its fellow stars have their turn.

Upon closer inspection, the mural incorporates various mediums to convey the artwork to a group of people that often are unable to partake in art appreciation, the visually impaired.

The mural resides on the side of Lighthouse for the Blind of Fort Worth, whose mission is to empower individuals who are blind and visually impaired to live their highest level of independence.

Auditory devices (usually found at crosswalks) provide audio descriptions, railings include Braille, high-contrast colors, a miniature 3-D model of the entire mural to allow individuals to take in the whole wall at once, and a website accessible by QR code that provides detailed descriptions.]]></summary>

Humans have been raising the young of other animals since long before recorded history. We’ve raised them for food, for friends, and for fun. These days, we’re raising a greater diversity of species, and for a greater diversity of reasons, than ever before. In large part, this diversification is motivated by a better understanding of our impacts on, and interdependence with, all the ecosystems of our planet.

Realizing that we’ve already driven many species to extinction, we design captive breeding programs to try to save the endangered ones. Finding that industrialized farming of m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps one of the last things a visitor might expect to encounter in Eureka, Illinois — a small town of about 5,000 between Peoria and Bloomington — is a four-foot by five foot, 2,200-pound chunk of the Berlin Wall. And yet there it is, a focal point in the Reagan Peace Garden on the campus of Eureka College.

Along with a bronze bust of Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States, the worn gray slab of concrete and rebar commemorates Reagan’s historic commencement address on campus on May 9, 1982, the 50th anniversary of his own graduation from the school. It also recalls Reagan’s 1987 exhortation to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall.”

The 33-inch bust by renowned sculptor Lonnie Stewart sits on a pedestal with quotes from Reagan's 1982 speech, including: “Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with conflict by peaceful means.”

The garden was donated by former Eureka College board chairman David Vaughan and his wife, Anne Vaughan, in 2000.]]></summary>

In under 15 minutes, we’ll take you to an incredible site, and along the way you’ll meet some fascinating people and hear their stories.

What is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? 

One is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. 

Similarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.]]></title>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wait, basketball was invented at a McDonald's!? No, not at all. Well, sorta. I don't know, let me explain: In December of 1891, James Naismith was responsible for the physical education of a group of young men attending the School for Christian Workers in Springfield, Massachusetts. Decembers in Massachusetts are really cold. It was Naismith's job to keep these young men active and engaged within the confines of a modestly-sized gymnasium.

As destiny would have it, he would discover the solution in a pair of peach baskets. 

The School for Christian Workers and the building it occupied would undergo several name changes over generations. The school itself would eventually go on to become Springfield College and move about a half mile down the road. The building, though, the geographical epicenter of the game of basketball, stood on the corner of State and Sherman. But in 1965, it was torn down to make way for a parking lot.

Thirty years later, in 1995, a McDonald's was built on the land. The McDonald's stands to this day at 782 State Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, marking the hallowed ground of the first buckets ever sunk in the history of the universe. In 2010, a monument was erected across the street at Mason Square, commemorating the invention of what is objectively the greatest game ever invented. The monument includes a sculpture depicting an adult passing a basketball to a child, surrounded by plexiglass displays illustrating the history of basketball. 

So, if you happen to be rolling through Springfield, you can drop in and grab a Big-Mac and just consider that you are standing on the spot where James Naismith first unveiled the game that would go on to become one of the most widely appreciated sports on the planet.]]></summary>

In that story, life started long ago on some planet Eden, which then via panspermia seeded life onto thousands of planets in Earth’s stellar nursery. One of those other planets reached our current advanced level probably at least a hundred of million years ago, after which it enforced a policy preventing any part of it from expanding to colonize the universe.

They’re seen in Namibia and Angola, too: fairy circles. They got that name in 2000, in a paper published in Basic & Applied Ecology by Thorsten Becker and Stephan Getzin. The German scientists described them as “circular or sub-circular patches devoid of any vegetation,” but “fairy circles” carries a little more magic.

Their round shape, uniform size, and lack of obvious explanation have made them a longstanding mystery of the natural world. “One of the [other] key signatures of fairy circles is that they have a so-called spatially periodic pattern,” says Getzin, of the University of Göttingen. In other words, the circles are more or less evenly spaced out amo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switzerland is known for several literary pilgrimage sites for fans of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He traveled here when he was 19 years old, and it is said that some of the Alpine villages he visited served as inspirations behind some of Middle-earth's iconic landscapes, such as Rivendell and the Misty Mountains. But the country has another can't-miss to offer to The Lord of the Rings enthusiasts, if not personally associated with Tolkien like the others.

In the winemaking village of Jenins stands a familiar-looking building, a leaf-covered cottage with a green round door. This is the Greisinger Museum, home to the largest Tolkien-related collection in the world.

Starting off as the private collection of Bernd Greisinger, the construction of the museum took place between 2008 and 2013 when it opened to the public. All of its rooms are inspired by and themed after Middle-earth locations. For instance, one of them copies the interior design of Bag End, the iconic home of Bilbo Baggins.

The museum's collection consists of more than 25,000 items, including a myriad of movie memorabilia and hundreds of original paintings by such renowned artists as Alan Lee, Roger Garland, and Ted Nasmith. It is also home to a copy of every impression of the UK first editions of The Lord of the Rings, as well as that of The Hobbit from 1937 to 1999, some of them very rare and signed.]]></summary>

The common tern was the first summer resident to arrive at a seasonal colony, and the scientists monitoring the site celebrated. Soon, more terns joined OH1, and nesting season was officially underway.

Then, within days, uninvited guests started showing up. Young gulls of different species began to loiter in the area, “just looking for a place to hang out,” says biologist Archer Larned, coastal bird habitat coordinator at the Maryland Coastal Bays Program (MCBP). Eventually, more than 100 of the noisy, pushy teenagers threatened to transform the terns’ breeding colony into their own s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driving down a gravel road in rural Missouri, the last thing you would expect to see are several pair of shoes dangling above your windshield, but this is exactly what you will encounter while driving down this rural Perry County road. 

The tree is just on the north side of the roadside ditch on County Road 324.  The origins stem from a trip taken in the early 2000s by the landowners to the state of Nevada where they encountered a similar tree with many pair of shoes dangling from the branches.

The man chose a tree close to the road on his property and flung a pair of shoes in it. At family gatherings, he encouraged his descendants to do the same. Now it has become a point of curiosity.

There are so many shoes in the tree it would be difficult to count. Some people make a wish before throwing their shoes, others write messages on their shoes like "self-doubt," "weight troubles," or a bible verse. The various types of shoes in the tree show a variety of footwear worn by the throwers. There are football cleats, running shoes, work boots, and basically anything that can catch itself on a branch in the tree.  Then there is the act of throwing, which is the best for getting the shoes attached without spending all day throwing them up in the air only to see them fall back down.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For at least a decade, a giant Buddha statue has watched over a stretch of U.S. 101 in Redwood City, California. The statue is not part of a temple complex or a garden. Instead, it is perched on top of a concrete shelter filled with dumpsters, in an office parking lot.

Its origins are a mystery, but it must have been quite the feat to transport and situate the massive statue on top of the concrete shelter. It faces away from the parking lot and gazes out over the freeway.

Despite the unusual location, the statue has become a site of worship. Visitors leave gifts along the statue's base, ranging from bottles of water to sticks of incense. Most drivers rushing through their commutes below likely have no idea that the watchful Buddha is sitting in such a humble spot.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking through the bustling Cape Town waterfront, you will see many old and new buildings, many of which have a maritime history. Perhaps one of the most important of these buildings is a tiny unsuspecting tower with a large ball on top of it. 

This tower, aptly called the Time Ball Tower, is an 1894 time device similar to the one in the Greenwich Observatory in the United Kingdom, which was used to give a visual signal of the time to ships in the bay, as this was much more accurate than an auditory signal like those of the noon gun, simply because sound travels much slower than light. This was a vital task, as a ship's clock (or chronometer) was needed for navigation, and any drifts could blow a ship off course or worse.  

The tower was initially built on the former Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, but an 1860s expansion of the harbor obscured the old tower, which created the need for a new one. Initially this was a wooden tower, which was later replaced by the current model in 1894, which remained in use for another 40 years. 

Since then the need for time balls dwindled, and so did their maintenance. The tower was used for a while as a signal repeater for the area, until it was declared a monument and restored in 1997. Since then the time ball has been operational again, and used on occasion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An institution in the urban landscape of the center of Madrid, the San Ginés Book Shop is still going strong. This open-air bookstore is steeped in history.

A stone's throw from one of the most famous places in Madrid for churros with chocolate is this picturesque bookstore. The San Ginés Book Shop is actually one of the oldest bookshops in Spain. It is situated in the scenic Pasadizo de San Ginés, between Calle Arenal and Calle Mayor, near the parish of the same name and Chocolatería de San Ginés

Its beginnings can be traced to the 17th century when Diego Logroño, the first known bookseller, started his business in 1650.

Old and used books are the store's expertise. Unique and exceptional copies are blended with city guides and political references on the tables set up at a street level, which—combined with the fantastic opportunities at reasonable prices—make this book sanctuary a haven for both collectors and curious shoppers.]]></summary>

In 2018, news spread around Saroj Duru’s village that four elephants had gathered at a nearby lake. Such creatures didn’t typically visit her region in central India—they were known to stay further north in more forested habitats—and so, out of curiosity, Duru and her neighbors walked down to see them.

The elephants rested in the water as people jostled at the shore, trying to get a closer look. Others climbed trees for a better view. After an hour of savoring the thrill of seeing such large animals, Duru headed back home. She was not sure when she would see them again.

Instead, that same day, a herd rampaged through the village’s farms. “They tore our boundary wall and tore up…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just outside Belfast on the N4 highway sits this piercing war memorial. The monument was built in 1970 as a replacement for the original, much smaller, monument that was placed in 1930.

This piercing, brutalist piece commemorates the Battle of Bergendal which took place in  August 1900. Thousands of British and Boer forces battled in what was the last set-piece battle of the Second Boer War. The battle resulted in the retreat of the Boer forces, more than 400 casualties, and Lord Roberts declaring the entire South African Republic as British territory. 

The site is difficult to miss when passing from either direction on the N4. An additional monument sitting behind the main one also commemorates the lives of the British forces that were lost. There is some signage giving background on the events of the battle, but due to sun damage, it's difficult to read. The names of the lives lost on both sides remain forged on granite plaques around the memorial.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cine Doré, inaugurated in 1912, is a modernist building that holds 1,250 spectators. The building underwent its first of many renovations in 1923 by architect Críspulo Moro Cabeza.

The building lost part of its original glamor during the late 1930s and became a rather unattractive place, and for some time it was even known as the Sunflower Palace. 

The façade is in a modernist style with six Ionic columns and a medallion surrounded by flowers. The Municipal Corporation acquired the cinema in 1982 and the Ministry of Culture used it as a stable location for projections for the Spanish Film Library.

The restoration by architect Javier Feduchi began in 1982 and ended in 1989, with the cinema inaugurated on February 28 of the same year. There are two theories about the origins of the name, one attributing it to a tribute to Gustave Doré and the other to the first two musical notes.

Its most recent restoration was led by the architect Javier Feduchi, who preserved the decorative and architectural elements of the old building adding a second room at the bottom.

Since 1989, the Doré Cinema has served as the Spanish Film Library's projection space. It is used for both its programming and a variety of outreach initiatives that promote Spanish cinematography and cinema in general.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/that-dam-black-stupa"/>
        <updated>2023-06-05T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a lot of historic landmarks in Vientiane remain in their original forms, having been numerous wars and invasions—particularly the Siamese onslaught of 1827 and the Indochina Wars that lasted for 55 years. A few exceptions are Wat Si Saket, a Buddhist temple built in 1818, and That Dam, an ancient stupa steeped in legend.

Standing in the center of a roundabout near the Talat Sao morning market, the stupa is believed to be around 500 years old, though the exact date of construction remains uncertain. The name That Dam (not that dam) means “black tower” in Lao, based on its current status. However, it was not always darkened and overrun with weeds; local legends claim that it was once gilded over and that the gold was all stripped away by the Siamese invaders.

Generally, stupas are built to enshrine Buddhist relics, most often the ashes of monks and nuns, sometimes of kings. In the case of That Dam, it is unknown what is buried inside, but locals whisper of an intriguing legend. According to them, lying dormant underneath the stupa is the Naga, a seven-headed serpent that will awaken whenever Vientiane faces a crisis. Many of them believe that it has protected the city from the 1827 invasion, as well as on other historical occasions.

The stupa has fallen into disrepair since the Naga last showed itself, weather-worn and all but neglected, but there are still believers in the powerful serpent. In fact, some locals seem to continue to visit the ancient monument to dedicate flowers to the forgotten guardian of Vientiane, in hopes that its peaceful slumber will never again be disturbed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many museums in Sarajevo dedicated to the three-year siege of the city in the 1990s, the War Childhood Museum stands out for its unique focus on the children who experienced it firsthand.

In this museum, there are no dry historical descriptions to be found—all the stories are told by the former children themselves. The exhibit contains 50 personal items belonging to locals who were children during the Siege of Sarajevo, ranging from toys to school books to emergency ration kits. Each object is connected to a story or memory from the war, which is told by its owner over a personal audioguide.

The War Childhood Museum is an intimate and emotional look at how children of various ages experience growing up in a warzone. Aside from the permanent exhibition in Sarajevo, the museum also engages in research and advocacy work, including projects with children in Syria and Ukraine.]]></summary>

Hm, I can't figure out what it should be either.  I also found it on the web, and kept a copy in case it disappears.  I tried to contact the author via a webform, but it didn't work.  I've removed the link from the bibliography, but really wish there could be a canonical source.  If I could contact the author, I'd recommend that he post it on the arXiv, where it could be preserved for posterity.]]></summary>

No, that makes sense!   You're right; I've removed the "set brackets" and hope that what I mean will be clear.  If you think another wording is better, please feel free to suggest something.]]></summary>

Thanks!  That was subtle, and resulted from some much-earlier changing of notation of "b" to "g".  And then your comment made me realized that there were several related infelicities near there too, caused by the same change.  Now fixed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this post is to present a simple formula for fairly pricing options, called the binomial options pricing model (Cox et al., 1979; Rendleman, 1979). This is sometimes called the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model (CRR) after the authors’ surnames in (Cox et al., 1979). I like this model because it is a simple, discrete-time model that captures much of the intuition behind how to price options, while avoiding much of the mathematical machinery needed for a continuous-time treatment or Black–Scholes (Black &amp; Scholes, 1973). Learning the binomial model is like climbing a smaller, easier mountain that gives views that are almost as good as its larger, more intimidating neighbor. As we will see, despite its simplicity this model introduces many important concepts from the options-pricing literature such as the no-arbitrage condition, pricing via replication, and the risk-neutral measure. And it does so without any advanced mathematics.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sarabhas-creamery-nashville"/>
        <updated>2023-06-02T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between Nashville’s iconic Music Row and Vanderbilt University, Sarabha's Creamery, the city's first homemade Indian-style ice cream shop, quietly works sweet, frozen magic from the second story of a nondescript strip mall. It’s the passion project of husband-and-wife duo Gursharan Singh and Manpreet Gill, who opened the parlor in 2022 after leaving jobs in tech. As Gill explained in an interview with Nashville Scene, the pair saw the empty storefront and decided to make the switch almost immediately. 

The mango kulfi—reminiscent of a tropical creamsicle—is the perfect starter to a multi-course ice cream feast, and comes in flavors like malai (with cardamom and milk solids) and kesar pista (saffron with pistachios). It melts quickly, so it’s both logistically sound and extremely satisfying to lick it off the stick as quickly as possible. 

The rest of the ice creams are equally stellar. Sarabhas’s incorporates less air into its Indian-style ice cream than a typical American scoop, giving it a texture more akin to gelato. Pair flavors such as rose tutti frutti, cardamom-scented Indian coffee, and paan nawabi (made with rose petals and cashews) in a crispy waffle cone or bowl, then wash it all down with a steaming masala chai.

Visually, the star of the show is Sarabhas' vibrant falooda, which arrives brimming with malai ice cream, sweet basil seeds, vermicelli noodles, and jellied fruit bobbing a cup of ice-cold milk, all finished with a cherry and a swirl of fuchsia rose syrup. Originally invented in Persia more than 2,500 years ago, faloodeh is a dessert made from frozen vermicelli soaked in a rose syrup. Persians began arriving in India during the 8th century, so faloodeh had plenty of time to catch on, attain royal status, and then morph into a popular milkshake-like dessert, all while retaining almost exactly the same name—falooda.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First housed inside an old mule-pulled trolley car, Brown’s Diner has changed hands three times since 1927 without losing its charm or its original ethos. Customers now have the option to dine on a covered patio area next to the old trolley, but the interior of the diner remains a time warp. 

The concise menu sticks to the classics—Frito chili pies, wings, fried chicken plates—and does them well. But the cheeseburger, Brown's claim to fame, is what an old-school fast food burger aspires to be: a slender patty with a hint of char on the outside and a pink interior, blanketed in American cheese and Duke’s mayo. It costs less than $10, tastes like a million bucks, and can (and should) be ordered alongside a basket of ultra-crispy Tater Tots.

The diner also bears the unusual distinction of having Nashville’s oldest beer license. Throughout its lifetime, generations of recording artists—from John Prine to Vince Gill—have played on its small stage and knocked back a cold one at the bar.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the final years of World War II, the Nazis forced thousands of prisoners to carve out an elaborate system of tunnels under Silesia's Owl Mountains. Almost all documentation related to the project was destroyed before the German surrender, meaning that the purpose and the true extent of these tunnels, codenamed Project "Riese" (or "Giant"), remain shrouded in mystery to this day.

The secret tunnels under Silesia have attracted numerous treasure hunters over the years, convinced that somewhere under this low mountain range lies a trove of Nazi loot. Theories about the true purpose of the Silesian tunnels range from a secret underground train system to transport stolen gold and other treasures, to the final hiding place of the Amber Room, to a covert weapons lab working on the "Wunderwaffe," a top-secret new weapon under development by the Nazis.

Most historians now believe that the tunnels were probably an attempt to move key factories underground and away from Allied bombing raids, but this hasn't stopped others from searching further. The full extent of the Nazi tunnel system under Silesia has yet to be uncovered, and the region continues to attract treasure hunters from all over the world, looking for new stores of Nazi gold.

The tunnels were abandoned after the war, and for several decades, only experienced cavers and treasure hunters dared to explore the many underground complexes dug out during Project Riese. Beginning in the 2000s, however, many known sections of the tunnels have been secured and opened to the public. The most famous of the Silesian tunnels are the ones under Ksiaz castle, but more than a dozen other self-contained tunnel systems have been discovered throughout the Owl Mountains, notably in the modern Polish towns of Osówka, Rzeczka/Walim, Soboń, Jawornik, and Włodarz.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wedged into a strip mall parking lot behind a Subway, this unassuming pizza parlor turns out 18-inch New York–style pies that could make Manhattan’s top pizzaiolos weak in the knees. Offerings lean unconventional, with standouts including the Esmerelda, featuring pistachio pesto, fig preserves, and charred lamb flank, and the Bianca, which tops a ricotta base with locally grown oyster mushrooms. 

The real feat of nature, however, is the pickle pizza, which pairs slivers of kosher dill pickles with toasted garlic, ricotta cream, smoked provolone, and ranch. Recently, the kitchen crew has been experimenting with a plussed-up variation called the “Hot Matty.” Chef David Bonner, Jr., inspired by a cluster of daikon radish sprouts growing on the counter, whipped up a daikon-feta pesto and amp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The biscuits arrive in an unassuming disposable box, still gently warm and roughly the size of a softball. Served with honey butter, jam, and tangy-sweet house-made curd, they’re already superb, but used as the vehicle for a breakfast sandwich, they’re transcendent. From the fried chicken and waffles to the shrimp and grits, there’s no dead weight on the short, sharp menu at Yay Yay’s, but if you only have stomach capacity for one item, a biscuit needs to be a part of it.  

Chef Charlotte Miller, who built up a reputation through catering for years, opened her first brick-and-mortar along with her business partner Jason Luntz in 2022. From its location on Jefferson Street, a historic commerce hub, to the wall murals, to the thoughtfully curated selection of books by Michael Twitty, Toni Tipton-Martin, and others, every facet of her café is a celebration of Black history and culture in Nashville. The airy, welcoming interior is ideal for a leisurely brunch or afternoon tea.

The “Can You Say Yay Yay?” with fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, and pimiento cheese on a biscuit is absolutely as much of a triple-threat as it sounds like. The whole concoction is structurally unsound in the right way, with a biscuit crumb so ethereal that it begins to disintegrate almost as soon as it hits your fingers. You won’t mind—the messy sense of immediacy of this sandwich is part of its allure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tinside Lido is a famous outdoor swimming pool complex located on the waterfront in Plymouth. It holds historical significance as a Grade II listed building, adorning the city's edge to the English Channel. 

The lido was opened in 1935 having been designed by the architect John Wibberley. It features an iconic Art-Deco style, with sleek lines, curved edges, and a stunning white façade. The design was influenced by the "ocean liner aesthetic" renowned during that era, with many of the U.K.'s seaside towns building lidos in the 1930s as an ode to the rise of popularity in sport and fitness. What makes this lido a must-visit is its heritage and beautiful curves, telling of history in its peeling paint and quaint 30s signage.

Over the years, Tinside Lido has undergone periods of closure and renovation to maintain its historic charm and functionality. Like other lidos, it has had periods when it was abandoned and out of use. Fortunately, Plymouth's Tinside Lido is one of the lucky lidos that has not been subject to demolition.

In 2003, the Tinside Lido underwent a major restoration, preserving its original features while incorporating modern facilities and amenities. Since then, it is functional in the summer months as a full-blown swimming pool that can be entered with a small fee.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-02T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1944, the Jewish people in Budapest, much like those before them in major cities across Europe, were forced to live in a small 20-block area of the 7th district. Many tourists today will learn about the plight of Hungary's Jewish citizens through the history of the Dohány Street Synagogue (The Great Synagogue), the Holocaust Memorial, and the Hungarian Jewish Museum. There are also some more subtle remnants of the impact of the Nazi pogrom on the people of Budapest, if you know where to look.

One of the more hidden memorials isn't entirely authentic, but its location is. The wall surrounding the Jewish ghetto was erected in November 1944 and destroyed in 2006. However, the 30-meter section that sits at the back of the courtyard at 15 Király Utca was reconstructed in 2010 (minus the original barbed wire) to serve as a permanent reminder of the tens of thousands who were forced to live in the area. You can find carefully placed stones and votive lamps along the wall in memory of the people who were interred there.

A small plaque on the street describes the memorial wall in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew. Getting to the wall itself requires entering the courtyard of the private apartments currently occupying the location. Pass through the courtyard and continue out through the short tunnel to a second courtyard to find the remains of the wall and a small plaque showing a map of the original ghetto.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After World War I, the 1919 Treaty of Versailles brought the Polish state back into existence after 123 years of division and occupation by the Prussian, Austrian, and Russian empires, formalizing the borders of this resurrected Poland by carving out territory from these three failing imperial powers.

Poland's new border was moved even further west after World War II, but during the interwar period between 1919 and 1939, its border with Germany followed more or less the same course as the provincial delimitation between modern Poland's Lubusz and Wielkopolska Voivodeships. This former international border is today overgrown with thick forests that conceal many old, fortified border crossings and bunkers which have become popular landmarks for local hikers.

Only one of the original border markers from the Versailles era has survived to the present day, and it stands in a public park in the Polish village of Wierzbno. It's engraved with the date of the Versailles Treaty—June 28, 1919—as well as a "P" for Poland and a "D" for Deutschland (Germany). The actual border crossing was located about one kilometer further east along Poland's national road 24 where the Lubusz Voivodeship meets the Wielkopolska Voivodeship, and is commemorated with a small monument, an information board, and some crumbling ruins of the customs buildings that used to stand there.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situated within the Fremantle Cemetery lies the final resting place of Ronald Belford "Bon" Scott, lead vocalist of the popular rock band AC/DC.

Bon was born on July 9, 1946, in a town north of the Scottish city of Dundee. (You can find a bronze statue of the singer in Kirriemuir, where he spent the first few years of his life.) In 1952, at the age of six, he migrated to Australia with his family. They lived in Melbourne for a time before relocating to the Perth suburb of Fremantle.

In 1974, he was asked to join the band AC/DC by Malcolm and Angus Young, two brothers from Glasgow and over a period of six years, Scott reached world fame through his performances as the lead singer of the band. 

On February 19, 1980, Scott tragically passed away after leaving a nightclub and later falling asleep in his friend's car, with the coroner determining the cause of death to be acute alcohol poisoning. Scott's body was embalmed and his family decided to scatter his ashes at this site in Fremantle Cemetery. The memorial site includes a plaque and memorial bench and due to his contributions to the field of music, the National Trust of Australia has deemed this a site of cultural significance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The history of Trutnov is intimately bound with dragons, as even the shortest term visitor will notice. Dragons adorn businesses throughout the city center and comprise some of the city's most prominent statues. Depending on the time of year, you may even be lucky enough to see one hoisted from city hall.

According to local legend, in 1006, shortly after Trutnov was founded, two stonecutters stumbled upon a dragon's den while searching the woods for building materials. They rushed back to town and informed a local knight, Lord Albrecht von Trautenberg. Although he was skeptical of their story, he went to investigate it for himself, bringing with him several men from the town armed with rope nooses to capture the beast. Using a lamb as bait, they lured the dragon from its lair and were able to subdue it before suffocating it to death with smoke. The dragon was then skinned, stuffed, and hung in the town square.

In thanks to Lord Albrecht, the new city was supposedly named in his honor (Trautenau), and was later adapted into Czech as 'Trutnov'. Legend also has it that the stuffed dragon was gifted to Brno, and continues to hang in its city hall.

Every year in the first weekend of May, the residents of Trutnov commemorate the slaying of the dragon in a ceremony called Už ho nesou ("They are already carrying him"), in which a tin dragon is symbolically hoisted up onto the facade of the city hall in the main square, where it remains until September or October. The ceremony itself is accompanied by a large public festival with food, drinks, and medieval costumes. Outsiders are rare, but are more than welcome.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1950s, the site now known as Riker Hill Art Park was used as a United States Army Nike Missile Tracking Base. Its location, the highest elevation in the county, offered the perfect clear line defense against anyone attempting to target the New York Metro area.

By the 1970s, due to advancements in weapons systems, these measures became obsolete, and in 1974, the base, known as Riker Hill Nike Battery Control Area NY-80, was sold to the county for $1. For a short time, the site was used to showcase dinosaur fossils that had been found nearby, in a quarry. But there was little interest from the public, and this was also closed down.

Shortly after, the former army barracks were transformed into 38 artist studios, with the spaces now being used for various disciplines, such as sculpture, painting, photography, glass blowing, pottery, printmaking, ceramics, and more.

Each of the buildings is painted a different color. Whilst taking a stroll around the 42-acre complex you can enjoy the scenic overlooks, check out the large metal sculptures, and also see if you can spot any military remnants.]]></summary>
