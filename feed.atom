That's a good idea - it is easy to say given what the reader knows, and an important concept.  Likely I'll add it in the next week.  (And thank you for the kind words.)]]></summary>

Thanks!  I see what you mean, and it definitely could be.  The one with times maps to the one with the otimes, which maps to the right side of that map in the notes.  So we're both right.   I want to write it like this so the two vector vector bundles (the two sides of the "\times") are most visible.

(And thanks for your other suggestions and corrections you sent by email; I think I owe you a response, and if so, hope to get to it soon.)]]></summary>

Deep in the mid-winter Maine woods in 1902, a young chemist persuaded six lumberjacks to be his lab rats. For one 18-meal work-week, he cataloged every scrap of food the men were about to eat, then he collected all the relevant feces, sealing them in “museum jars” and freezing them in a snowbank cache. With the cooperation of the camp cook, he also assembled and froze samples of every type of food served to the men. He then transported all these icy jars to the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Maine at Orono for analysis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the minerals of a mining town have been fully extracted, there is a chance that it will become a ghost town. That is what happened to Real de Catorce in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí when its silver ran dry in the early 20th century. But it was never completely abandoned. 

The land around the town, particularly the desert below, is known as Wirikuta, the sacred land of the Huichol people. Real de Catorce has long been a pilgrimage site for them due to its proximity to Wirikuta. It's also a place of pilgrimage for Roman Catholics. The Parish of Immaculate Conception Cathedral draws visitors hoping to ask a favor from Saint Frances Assisi.

Today, the town sees pilgrims of a different sort, namely tourists in search of the magic that keeps visitors coming to this out-of-the-way location. When silver mining ended over a century ago, the town's population dropped down to the hundreds. Today the town has around a thousand permanent residents. The sizable tourist flow keeps its small hotels busy. 

Much of the town is abandoned. Be sure to visit the historic bullfighting ring and its amphitheater. A hike up to the hills will give you a panoramic view of the town and its surroundings. Throughout the town, the Huichol sell their intricate, colorful artwork.]]></summary>

In August 2023, a new Broadway play is opening at the Golden Theater on West 45th Street in New York, The Shark Is Broken, about the trials, tribulations, and humor of the making of the movie—Jaws, obviously—that changed the film industry.

The play dramatizes the bickering between three stars of the film—Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and Robert Shaw, whose son Ian co-wrote and stars in the play—and the difficulties of having a giant, animatronic shark as a scene partner. Back in 1974, it wasn’t just the fake shark that presented challenges—the production was menaced by real live sharks before the real filming e…]]></summary>

One miner in particular, Henry Chaffey, lived in this isolated hut for over 40 years with his wife Annie Fox. Visitors today will be struck by the isolation of the building, tucked between mountains and forests. One can only imagine how lonesome it would have been a hundred years ago. However, Annie was always glad to greet visitors in her impressive Edwardian-style clothing.

Chaffey would make visits to Motueka and Takaka by foot for provisions and to sell what he was able to mine in order to support himself and his wife. This trek would have taken him days to complete.]]></summary>

But the Khan’s tomb is properly called a cenotaph—a monument to someone buried elsewhere—because it is empty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just off the bustling Magazine Street in the Irish Channel, the National Shrine of Blessed Father Xavier Seelos welcomes visitors to learn of the mystical life of the “Cheerful Ascetic.” The Redemptorist order established the site to promote the canonization cause of Seelos.

Born Francis Xavier Seelos in Bavaria, Germany in 1819, he eventually pursued a religious life and was ordained by the Redemptorist order in 1842. Seelos traveled to the United States, first residing in New York to minister to German-speaking immigrants. During his lifetime, Seelos witnessed the chaos of the American Civil War. Father Seelos urged President Lincoln to excuse seminarians from military service during the conflict. He transferred to New Orleans in 1866 where his life ended from yellow fever a year later at the age of 48.

An in-depth account of his life is portrayed at the center, which includes a wide range of artifacts including his original lead coffin. His cilice and flagellum are on display in the Walk of Life section of the campus. Hours and days of operation vary and large groups are encouraged to make arrangements in advance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[August 2023 promises to be a big month for the Moon. On August 1 and August 30 (Eastern Time), the orb will be near its perigee—its closest point to Earth—and the full moon will loom large in the night sky, a phenomenon brilliantly branded as the "supermoon." The full moon on August 2 is the Sturgeon Moon, a name drawn from the belief that the best fishing occurs under its glow, and the one on August 30 is a Blue Moon, the relatively rare second appearance of a full moon in a single month.

But even when the moon isn't at its (seemingly) biggest and brightest, humans have been entranced by it as a celestial body. From the Atlas Obscura archive, explore centuries of attempts to map, explore, own, and even spend eternity on Earth's only natural satellite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my last post, I asked " why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters on the issue [of abortion]"? I should have said something like "why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters by adopting more moderate positions"?  As I suggested in a post a few years ago, another way to appeal to moderate voters is by focusing on the negative--fears of what the extremists on the other side might do.  That's what the Democrats have done, and it's worked pretty well because many prominent Republicans have taken extreme positions.  Also, there is an asymmetry on the abortion issue--it's easier to find shocking examples of women who were denied abortions that most people will agree should have been allowed (e. g., the case that came up shortly after the Dobbs decision, a 10-year-old rape victim who had to travel out of Ohio to get an abortion) than shocking examples of women who had abortions that most people agree shouldn't have been allowed.  So if it comes down to a contest of extreme positions, the side favoring legal abortion is likely to win.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Indigenous Eats, owner Jenny Slagle and her husband, Andrew, serve Native American dishes prepared using family recipes. Offerings range from Indian tacos to desserts drenched in huckleberry sauce, and ingredients are sourced exclusively from locally owned Native American businesses. Fry bread, which appears here in both sweet and savory forms, is made according to a recipe from the owner’s mother. 

Slagle, a member of the Yakama Nation and descendant of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, always dreamed of running a restaurant for Native American comfort food. For years, she ran an Indian taco stand with her four children and mother at Spokane’s annual Falls Pow Wow. Finally, an inspiring visit to Denver’s Tocabe: An American Indian Eatery, reassured her there was an appetite for such dishes. In 2022, Indigenous Eats was born.

Around the restaurant’s deli-style order counter, walls are adorned with local Indigenous art and traditional melodies resound from the speakers. Exhibits and posters paint a picture of the vibrant Spokane’s Indigenous ancestry, where over 300 tribes in the county have created lively community spaces.

Slagle and her family recipes have proven that even a fast food restaurant can be a powerful medium for preserving heritage and celebrating Native American culture.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last 20 years, this family-owned haven for hearty Polish fare has been gracing downtown Glendale with hunter's stew, pierogis, kielbasa, goulash, cabbage rolls, and so much more. (“A Touch of European” might be more aptly named “A Bear Hug from Poland”). Portions are generous, but save room for dessert, which includes house-baked cookies such as angel wings and kolaczki.

Chef-owner Waldemar Okula is fiercely proud of his homeland—a fact readily apparent to anyone who's gone on one of his annual culinary tours of Poland. Twice a year, he hosts a cooking class where participants either learn how to make Easter classics like white borscht or a Polish-style Christmas feast.

It's BYOB, it's cash only, and it's unlike anything else you'll find in the greater metro Phoenix area. You'll hear the owners speaking Polish amongst themselves and to other diners who've immigrated from the region.

If the specials include a dill pickle soup, order a cup. Do not doubt its power.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Mary Coyle moved to Phoenix from Ohio in 1951, she brought a knack for making ice cream with her from the midwest. Her namesake parlor, Mary Coyle Ol' Fashion Ice Cream, continues to survive and thrive in a smaller, nearby location, 72 years later. At 16% butterfat, the ice cream itself is ultra-rich and is still made on-site to this day using the original recipes that first made Mary a success.

Not only are the options premium, but they're also expansive. The variety of flavors—an unexpected feature for a classic ice cream parlor—is a thrill in and of itself. Choose from a wide range of popular and nostalgic flavors, from black raspberry to black licorice, spumoni to burgundy cherry. Carefully sourced ingredients, such as the nuts in the butter pecan and maple walnut flavors sourced from Mount Hope, in Sedona, make each scoop shine.

The new location's checkerboard floors, neon soda fountain sign, and pink-striped walls (which harken back to the original location) let you know you're in for a deliciously sweet time travel session.]]></summary>

That night, Sakata was looking back on a distinguished six decades at the head of Japan’s top seed company. He had founded Sakata Seed Corporation in 1913, growing it from a small purveyor of lily bulbs into a major multinational developer of flower, fruit, and vegetable varieties. Today, the spaghetti squash can be counted among Sakata’s many successes; but it was far from an overnight one.

Since the 1930s, Sakata had been the exclusive marketer of spaghetti squash in the United States. According to Dr. Harry Paris of Israel’s Volcani Institute Agricultural Research Organization…]]></summary>

        <id>https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bust-edmond-rostand-casino-park-luchon-france</id>
        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bust-edmond-rostand-casino-park-luchon-france"/>
        <updated>2023-07-27T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The commune and spa town of Bagnères-de-Luchon is situated in the picturesque valleys and hills of southwestern France. Nestled close to the Spanish border, the town sits among the foothills of the French Pyrenees and is renowned for its thermal springs. For centuries, especially in the Victorian period, attracted people in poor health looking to convalesce in a scenic setting. One can easily imagine bourgeois visitors coming to Luchon to bask in therapeutic waters, perhaps as they cough discretely into a bloodstained lace handkerchief.

Today, Luchon's tourists enjoy the benefits of the waters sans illnesses. Modern upgrades to the Thermes buildings demonstrate that Luchon's restorative springs remain as popular as ever with visitors.

The local architecture is a curious mix of Belle Epoque grandeur and Tyrolean ski resort, unsurprising, given that the town also caters to skiers and snowboarders who venture into the snow-capped mountains every winter. The town remains a beautiful spot to enjoy a coffee at a boulevard cafe while admiring the majestic mountain range that dominates the town's skyline.

These breathtaking peaks also captivated the writer, poet, and playwright Edmond Rostand who spent many summers enjoying the unique pleasures of Luchon while residing at Villa Julia, a holiday home built by the Rostand family. Here, Edmond composed love letters and wrote his most famous literary work, Cyrano De Bergerac.   

A commemorative bust was erected in 1922, four years after Rostand's death at the age of 50. The statue features his curly mustache and an unmistakable creative air as the statue looks wistfully into the middle distance seeking inspiration. Appropriately the bust sits where his effigy can view the mountains, the river Pique, and Villa Julia.  

It's a discrete but fitting tribute to a man known as France's National Poet who gave the world one of its most famous literary characters and who found vast reserves of inspiration in the splendor of the Pyrenees and the charming spa town of Luchon.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-26T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grandma’s cake and chit-chat—that’s the concept behind the lovable Munich café and bakery Kuchentratsch (in German, ‘cake gossip’).

Located in the heart of the Bavarian capital, this sweet haven has perfected the typical German tradition of Kaffee und Kuchen-Zeit (afternoon coffee and cake time) and put it toward a good cause. The establishment doubles as a social initiative startup where all fresh-baked confections are made by local elderly folks.

Founded in 2014, Kuchentratsch serves some of the city’s best traditional German cakes. Depending on the season, and who’s aproned-up that day, a delectable selection may include anything from rhubarb torte to crumb cake (Streuselkuchen) to marble cake (Marmorkuchen). Cakes are displayed in a glass vitrine next to the name of the Oma or Opa (grandma or grandpa) who made them.

Cakes are delivered Germany-wide but for sit-in guests, the bakery provides cozy tables in an inviting interior. Think: large glass windows are adorned with plush armchairs against a strawberry-pink ceiling. Throughout the day, elderly folks bake in an open kitchen and socialize around tables, gabbing while waiting on their oven timers. Pensioners work part-time at Kuchentratsch, and many spend their retirement time getting together here, even when they’re not on duty for the dough.

The wafting aromas of warm treats and happy banter contribute to the ambience that owners Katharina Mayer and Katrin Blaschke always wanted: an interactive “experience bakery” spanning tastes and generations. Along with frequent baking workshops, Kuchentratsch aims to support the elderly with a fun hobby that provides purpose, prevents loneliness and supplements pensions with extra pocket money.

So, whether you go for the poppy seed crumble or a chocolate cake made especially for the vegan crowd, rest assured that, as the German saying also goes in English, “the way to one’s heart is always through the stomach.”]]></summary>

I have been working on this in part because it is a good measurement to make with , and in part because the dipole in the quasars . I have many thoughts, but I will save them for later.Quaiais controversial
Anyways, Abby Williams (NYU) has been working on making this measurement, and her dipole amplitude and direction depend on what we hold fixed and what we vary (in particular selection-function components), and they also depend on what sky region we use. None of this is surprising; the selection function has a strong dipole in it, and it is not known precisely. But then I don't understand how the studies published previously have such good error bars. Maybe they didn't consider the various different fitting regimes?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan, an island, cherishes seafood as a culinary staple. For generations, seafood soups and congee used to dominate the breakfast tables and early morning street food stall menus, until they were slowly phased out for more popular wheat-based dishes like scallion pancakes and egg crepes. Emmanuel is one of the few exceptions and has been whipping up comforting bowls of hot tilapia soup for hungry customers in the morning since 1977. 

For decades, the place was an old road side stall servicing blue-collar workers. But in 2021, the third-generation owner convinced his parents to take over and give the brand a 21st-century face-lift. They’ve since relocated to a cozy brick-and-mortar space with indoor seating and air conditioning. 

Despite the refresh, the menu and the prices have stayed exactly the same: whole slabs of fish sourced fresh from the market daily are served in soup, usually paired with a hearty serving of stir-fried rice vermicelli with a heaping of braised ground pork, crunchy bean sprouts, and housemade chili sauce. Every fish is carefully skinned and gutted and served whole—with the head, eyes, and fins still intact. 

While the menu is small, there is something for everyone on it. If fish isn’t your thing, they do a classic egg drop soup or one topped with hearty slices of pork.The best part? The prices for each dish has stayed well under 100 NTD ($3 USD).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real Guts Cafe is a mecca for Taiwanese cinephiles. Stocked with movie paraphernalia and books, it is the brainchild of Taiwanese director Wei Te-sheng, whose Cape No. 7 was Taiwan's second highest-grossing movie of all time and achieved the longest theatrical release in the island’s cinematic history. 

The food is typical cafe fare: coffees, teas, sandwiches, waffles. For something more substantial, they do a decent barbecued pork, sliced into thin pieces, paired with a sunny side-up egg and served over rice. There are grilled rice balls and bright salads. Even local craft beer if one is so inclined. 

However, the food is secondary because the main draw at Real Guts is the decor. There are old film cameras, director clapboards from Wei’s movie sets, and two real Golden Horse awards (considered the Oscars of Chinese-language cinema) on display. There’s also an entire bookshelf brimming with storyboards and set design drafts, plus a merchandise section selling miscellanea like T-shirts of endemic Taiwanese animals. 

While it’s all a bit chaotic, Real Guts draws a consistent crowd of work-from-home folks and students, who like the floor-to-ceiling windows and lush foliage that hangs from the nooks and crannies of the space. Stocked with a reasonable amount of outlets and Wi-Fi, it is a relaxing place to pull up a laptop and get some work done.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The common shrew only lives about a year. Black rhinos, on the other hand, can make it to a 50th birthday. They’re very different creatures, for sure, but even species that are rather alike—take a lab rat and a wild, hairless counterpart, the naked mole rat—can have drastically different lifespans, too. Think three years versus 30. We humans can live twice or three times as long as our closest relatives, chimpanzees.

It’s natural to ask which mammal lives the longest. Spoiler alert: It’s the bowhead whale. (There are a few other, non-mammalian creatures that have them beat: a deep-dwelling shark, a clam, a jellyfish that just doesn’t die at all.) But what constitutes a long life can vary widely based on size and lifestyle, metabolism and environment, so maybe the better question is why s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every day, scores of tourists cross Charles Bridge and flock towards the John Lennon Wall in the Malá Strana district, making their way across the island of Kampa. If you take that route, chances are you'll be passing over the Čertovka, or the Devil's Stream, a quaint little canal that gives the area its nickname: Little Venice.

As you cross a small bridge over the stream, there'll be a post-medieval water mill called the Grand Priory Mill on the other side, just about 50 yards away from the John Lennon Wall. At first glance, it's simply a cute, quaint sight, but then you'll catch sight of a strange figure sitting on the wooden platform beside it. Squint and zoom in, and you will see that it's not really a human figure, but a googly-eyed, green-skinned goblin smoking a pipe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just south of England's Lake District in Cumbria, a medieval building, known as the Castle Dairy in Kendal, has two minuscule windows that provide just enough light for the 700-year-old rooms. The Castle Dairy may be the oldest continuously inhabited building in the historic market town, and it's believed someone has lived there since the early 14th century.

Originally built as a farmhouse, the building's subsequent uses are unknown, though it was possibly used as a private residence. The name "dairy" may have been a corruption of "dowry" and it has been inferred that the property was once a widow's home.

While some of the original windows were once bricked up, over the years many of them have been reopened. On the upper floor, there is a small chapel with one of the small windows while the other miniature window looks out from the other side of the house.

One local story claims that the floor contains remnants from a Roman road, which once ran along the banks of the river Kent.]]></summary>

When you were a kid, chances are you spent at least one starry night outside, looking up in awe and curiosity—and maybe confusion—about everything up there. If you have children in your life, this experience is one of the most fun things you can offer during summertime (besides, I suppose, a trip to the pool or some ice cream).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Northeast of Leeds, England is the small town of Pickering in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire. The small town's parish church, the Church of St. Peter & St. Paul, features remarkable original medieval wall paintings and welcomes both human and canine visitors. The first church on the site was built by the Anglo-Saxons. But the church was later rebuilt around 1140 following a Norman design. Later additions were then added in the 13th and 14th centuries. The church's famous medieval wall paintings were most likely commissioned and painted in the mid-14th century based on the costumes of some of the figures and what is known about that time period.

The paintings feature images of people, some with armor, alongside horses and dragons, and they depict Christ's passion, including the c…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For first-timers, a trip to Taiwan isn’t complete without a hearty bowl of beef noodle soup. A dish unique to the island, it was invented in the mid-20th century by refugees who had left the Chinese mainland for Taiwan during the Chinese civil war. Today, it’s become somewhat of the national dish of Taiwan. But with over 10,000 dedicated beef noodle soup shops on the island, narrowing down the options is a harrowing task. 

Chef Hung Beef Noodle Soup is a great place to start. The eponymous owner Hung Ching-Lung is a five-time award-winning champion of the annual beef noodle soup competition in Taiwan—the most decorated winner in the event’s history. 

The restaurant’s menu offers a diverse overview of the beef noodle soup options on the island, from a classic star-anise-heavy broth flavored with spicy bean paste to a minimally seasoned clear broth where delicate slices of beef are highlighted. A couple of Hung’s award-winning bowls are on the menu as well: there’s one topped with tripe, tendon, and shank and another with medium rare, paper-thin slices of beef overlaid on top. 

For Chef Hung, beef noodle soup is much more than just a profession. It’s a passion. He has a cattle farm on the outlying island of Kinmen, where he raises his own cows for the restaurants. And he’s often tasked with training up-and-coming chefs on how to make a fantastic beef broth for their restaurants. He says the key is procuring a really high-quality cut of beef and making a flavorful broth. Everything else is just secondary.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The church of St. George the Martyr is the oldest Anglican church in Southeast Asia. Before the church was built, religious services in Penang were conducted at Fort Cornwallis and later at the courthouse in George Town, a short distance away. Plans for a church were submitted as early as 1810 but it wasn’t until the East India Company Act of 1813 gave the British East India Company authority that the church was built. It was constructed in 1818 and consecrated in 1819 costing some 60,000 Spanish dollars (also known as "pieces of eight").

The first significant event that took place in the church after its completion was the wedding of Governor William Edward Philips to Janet Bannerman, the daughter of his predecessor, Colonel John Alexander Bannerman on June 30, 1818.

On the grounds stands a memorial to Francis Light, a British explorer and the founder of the British colony of Penang and its capital city George Town in 1786. Interestingly, he is also the father of William Light, who founded the city of Adelaide in Australia.

The church was first restored after being looted and badly damaged during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia in the Second World War. It was restored again in 2011 after being designated a National Heritage in 2007.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This eclectic 80s erotica-themed bar fronted by a bright and loud neon sign is a celebration of vices. Inside: a cheeky diner awash in red lighting, analog phones, floral print diner chairs, plush banquettes, and a working disco ball in the corner. Keeping with the theme, the shelves are stocked with magazines crammed with centerfolds of busty, scantily clad women.  

The aesthetic of Pure Love is a nod to the “grandpa shops” of Taipei—old-school karaoke rooms where older men are known to seek the company and services of flirtatious waitresses. Big in the ‘60s and up to the ‘80s, they have since waned considerably in popularity after a crackdown in prostitution in the ‘90s.  

Pure Love Snack Bar is a modern revival of the grandpa shop, but without any of the shady or illegal dealings. The food is unpretentious and rooted in Taiwanese classics like braised pork over rice, oyster soup, fried chicken, and deep-fried noodles smothered in an earthy satay sauce. The drinks are more elevated and utilize locally available flavors like guava, tieguanyin tea, and mulberry.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked inside an old wooden building framed by a thick canopy of bright pink bougainvillea, Jinjiang Tea Room has been slinging out hearty dishes for over a decade. The term “tea house” is a misnomer; Jinjiang is a full-service restaurant dedicated to Hakka cuisine—the fare of a Han Chinese subgroup known for its emphasis on salty and smoked meats and a love of pickles. 

Situated in an 80-something-year-old house dating back to the Japanese colonial occupation of Taiwan, the restaurant is a quaint cottage in a forest of skyscrapers. The inside is just as charming, with outdated white ceiling tiles, wooden tables, and shelves stuffed with cute knick-knacks and miscellaneous clutter. 

The food is as wholesome as the decor. They do cold poached chicken—the skin crisp and gelatinous—served with a kumquat dipping sauce. There’s a lovely salted pork, sliced into bite-sized pieces, which pairs especially well with a hot bowl of short-grain rice dressed with soy  sauce-flavored lard.

The tender shoots of bird’s nest ferns are sauteed with the pickled seeds of a bird lime tree. There’s slippery noodles made with green tea, and thick belts of rice noodles with minced pork. Dessert is complimentary—usually a bowl of grass jelly, a mint-like herb beloved among the Hakka in Taiwan, or small mochi balls dressed with sweet ground peanuts. 

For the full experience, finish off with lei cha, a ground tea made with pounded grains. It’s akin to matcha, but less vegetal and more toasted and nutty.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some 1,000 years ago, the Normans pushed north attempting to subjugate part of Westmorland. As part of this effort, Castle Howe was built. Kendal’s undisputed first castle, Castle Howe, was built in 1092 and overlooks the town.

The fortifications consist of a well-defined motte, rising to around 33 feet and measuring around 59 feet in diameter at the summit. The base of the motte measures around 150 feet, and is surrounded by ditches and embankments. The bailey lays to the east of the motte, and is roughly triangular in shape, and was turned into a bowling green and is now a public park.

The Barony of Kendal fell at the hands of Ivo de Taillebois around 1092 and as a reward for his unfailing military support and success, Ivo was granted the Barony of Kentdale, a title that brought with it huge swathes of land in what is now Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria.

Kendal Castle, to the east of the earthworks, was probably built while Castle Howe was still being used. Likely, Castle Howe was the baronial center of Kirkland, and Kendal Castle was the baronial center of Kentdale. Castle Howe eventually became redundant, as did the Kendal Castle, and the administrative center of Kendal moved to the Moot Hall in the center of town.

In 1788, to celebrate the centenary of the revolution of 1688, an obelisk was erected on the summit of Castle Howe. The monument was designed by architect Francis Webster who was a native of Kendal.]]></summary>

The district of Hansaviertel was a rich urban neighborhood, and quite desirable thanks to its proximity to the city center while being right next to Tiergarten Park. But after the Second World War, it was almost completely leveled.

East Berlin had been rebuilding over the 50s, courtesy of its new socialist government and the West didn’t want to be left behind. To show that they were a new free and capitalist society, they also decided to rebuild, and the destroyed district of Hansaviertel proved to be an ideal location.

More than 50 architects were invited to work on the project, German and international alike. There were some famous names in the group, including Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer, the designer of the new Brazilian capital. Each presented their own future vision of housing.

The district contains a school, a kindergarten, a shopping center with a library and a theatre, and even an academy of arts. Additionally, every house has some special spin. They usually have descriptions on the ground floor somewhere, though a guide can be bought at the shopping center at a club made for this district]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world has seen many unique methods aimed at increasing road safety, from traffic control towers to roadside sentries. In Miyakojima, the local traffic safety association tried a slightly new way back in the 1990s, when five policemen-like figurines were set up at various crossings around the island. These were known as Mamoru-kun patrolmen. 

As the story goes, Mamoru-kun was born on August 5, 1991. He stands 180 centimeters tall, and his official titles are "Miyakojima Safety Association Staff" and "Miyakojima Police Transportation Division Officer."

Over the years there have been more figurines set up all over the island. Currently you can find 20 Mamoru-kun in various places in Miyakojima. Nineteen of these patrolmen are male, but at the Miyakojima Police Station, you can also find his female colleague Maruko-chan.

Thanks to their loyal service in all weather conditions, Mamoru-kun was also given a special Miyakojima residence permit by Mayor Toshihiko Shimoji in a ceremony back in 2012.

Originally these figurines were considered kimo (creepy), but recently Mamoru-kun have got their own fanbase. With their popularity rising, you can now also find Mamoru-kun cookies, soft drinks, and more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyday on the sides of streets across Japan, from major urban intersections to sleepy rural roads, stand young children, poised to dash out into traffic. But Tobita-kun, the name by which the children are commonly known, never actually makes it out onto the road. These “children” are, in fact, a style of wooden sign that for the last half-century has served as a warning to the nation’s drivers to watch for flesh-and-blood children who may unexpectedly dart into traffic, particularly in school zones. Often charmingly handmade by local councils, Tobita-kun has become an icon on Japan’s roadways—and played a role in revolutionizing road safety in the country.

Each female Genji firefly, Nipponoluciola cruciata, can lay up to 500 of the caviar-like orbs, carefully depositing them across the mossy banks of rivers and streams in blankets of pale yellow.

In the wild, only a tiny fraction of the eggs survive. River pollution, flood prevention measures, overfishing, and excess urban light devastated the insect’s population in the 20th century. But at the museum, artificial breeding and rearing methods will coax 30,000 Genji fireflies into larvae, a phase in which they live like tiny, voracious underwater explorers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rather than driving through a tunnel beneath the Alps, this pass offers unparalleled views as you traverse over the mountains. The scenic route connects Val-Cenis in Western France with Susa in Italy, and was one of the most well-traveled paths through the Alps during the Middle Ages. The road will take a few hours to traverse, but the views and sights along the way are well worth it. 

Some scholars believe that this is the exact pass that Hannibal took with his army and war elephants in 218 BC. More than a millennia later, in 1414, Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara took this route back to Italy after meeting Charles VI in Paris. Niccolò described the pass as having "a good ascent and bad descent." Pilgrims have also taken this route on the way to Rome and the Vatican for centuries.

Eventually, Napoleon built a road on the old pilgrimage trail sometime in the early 19th century. In 1871, a railroad tunnel known as Frejus Tunnel was constructed some 30 miles away. The tunnel connected Mondane, France with Bardonecchia, Italy. It was one of the first tunnels of its kind and exhibited a remarkable feat of engineering for the time. Today, the tunnel is still one of the largest railroad tunnels in the world measuring some eight miles long. The road is also has been used as part of the Tour de France.

At the top of the pass, alongside an icy blue lake known as Lac du Mont Cenis, statues of Hannibal's elephants line the trail. The building of a dam created the artificial lake in 1921. The dam, today, feeds two hydroelectric power plants. The lake occasionally empties for maintenance. 

At the top of the pass, as you look out over the lake, you'll find a very quirky chapel. Built in 1967, the chapel is shaped like a pyramid and is made of concrete. Today it also houses a museum about the history of this region and is one of the highest museums in Europe. Other nearby sights include a botanical garden and multiple fortifications.]]></summary>

Located in his family's backyard, Linamnam (which means “delicious” in Tagalog) was opened in 2018 when Baldosano was still in his teens; fresh from competing on the TV show Junior MasterChef Pinoy Edition and a traineeship at Manila’s esteemed Toyo Eatery.

Linamnam opened its doors to the public in August 2018, offering a warm setting that puts the spotlight on the chef's bold dishes. The main dining room is a bahay kubo, a traditional thatched-roof, stilt house built on stilts typical to the Filipino lowland countryside. Built by Baldosano’s father, it offers an al fresco space adjacent to the chef‘s own childhood bedroom. …]]></summary>

Their models are sophisticated, and give a full spectrum in every direction from the surface patch. Thus we can integrate a set of patches into a surrogate combined spectrum for one rotating star covered in convecting patches. We discussed how we might do that, technically, and what projects we might then do with the output. What I want to do (yes, you guessed it) is build data-driven models of stellar granulation to improve radial-velocity surveys.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine Bagels, a family-owned establishment, has been delighting Berliners with their authentic New York-style bagels since 2013. Laurel Kratochvila’s bagel journey dates back to 1897 when her great-great grandfather, Hyman Cooper, declared that he was moving to New York City for one simple reason: “The bagels are better.” Although he ended up in Boston, running a fix-it shop, his declaration set the stage for four generations of bagel devotion within the family.

What began as a small addition to the English-language bookstore Shakespeare and Sons has become a destination in its own right. Laurel brought her family recipes to Berlin, recreating the authentic homemade bagels she missed from her New York roots. Her partner, Roman, who owns other bookstores in the Czech Republic and worked at the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, complements the culinary experience with an extensive collection of English and some French books.

Bagels are hand-rolled daily in small batches. Overnight proofing, rapid boiling, and hot baking process lend to an old-fashioned flavor across varieties from poppyseed to cinnamon raisin and rosemary sea salt. A variety of homemade schmears and toppings, including sandwich options with lox and whitefish salad, keeps the bagel game interesting for a dedicated legion of regular customers.]]></summary>

In 1974, the Mauritius kestrel—a photogenic bird with a speckled white breast and a vibrant red back and crown—came frighteningly close to extinction. Only four individuals remained. Thanks to decades of captive breeding on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the kestrel population climbed to 1,000 birds. Half a century later, as their numbers once again decline, another species is helping the charismatic raptors hang on: the traveler’s tree, a palmlike plant in the genus Ravenala.

But traveler’s trees are invasive to Mauritius and are causing problems for other native species in the ecosystem. Conservationists are now faced w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As cities grow, they tend to swallow and overtake smaller towns that were once situated well outside. Often this leads to a loss of the local identity, unless the former towns fight back. Weil am Rhein did this in a very creative way by building giant chairs.

The town is situated just over the German border, not far from Dreiländereck, where the borders of Germany, France, and Switzerland meet. It used to be completely separate from Basel, but as both cities grew, their borders started touching more and more, to the point where many people started thinking that Weil am Rhein was the German part of Basel.

People in Weil am Rhein disliked this and decided that they needed a new and separate identity from Basel. They decided that giant chairs were the key. Large chairs started appearing all over the town, not only on the ground but also on top of buildings. Most of them are made in a way that makes them climbable.

In the 1970s, a local artist and architect named Lassù burned chairs as an art form. He built a large concrete chair on top of a pyramid to allow for recurrent burnings.

Furniture is a big bar of the history of Weil am Rhein. The town is home to the headquarters of the Vitra Corporation, one of the largest manufacturers of designer furniture in Europe. The company operates the Vitra Design Museum, which explores the history of furniture and interior design. Its collection includes several historically significant chairs, including Eero Saarinen's Tulip Chair, Charles and Ray Eames' iconic Lounge Chair, and many more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Petroglyph Beach is a remarkable site located in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a scenic park that stretches across Arizona and Utah. Petroglyph Beach stands out as an archaeological treasure and offers visitors a glimpse into the rich history of the region.

Situated on the edge of the Colorado River, Petroglyph Beach is named for the numerous petroglyphs found etched into the walls of Glen Canyon. Petroglyphs are ancient rock carvings made by ancient Native Americans who inhabited the area centuries ago. These carvings depict various symbols, animals, and scenes that hold significant cultural and spiritual meaning.

The beach itself is a serene and tranquil spot where visitors can relax and enjoy the picturesque surroundings before continuing down the river.  Exploring Petroglyph Beach offers a unique opportunity to connect with the past and appreciate the artistic expressions of the indigenous people who once thrived in the region. The petroglyphs provide a glimpse into their daily lives, beliefs, and experiences. Visitors can spend hours examining the intricate carvings and pondering the stories they tell.

It's important to note that Petroglyph Beach is a protected site, and visitors are encouraged to treat it with respect and care. It is essential to avoid touching or damaging the petroglyphs to preserve them for future generations. Many sites within the National Park Service have specific guidelines and regulations in place to ensure their preservation, so it's advisable to follow any posted instructions.]]></summary>

I’ve always found it interesting how fictional food makes its way into the real world. A few years back, I wrote an article about how fantasy-novel food is a cuisine unto itself, and I still regret that I was abroad both times that Denny’s had an official Hobbit menu.
  A few weeks ago, I was reminded of the existence of another fictional culinary genre: anime food. Over the last few decades, Japanese animation and manga has had a huge influence on global fashion, film, music, and art. I would argue that it’s also familiarized people around the world with Japan’s popular and regional foods.

These round holes that can be found near the entrance of several buildings in the old town confuse many people. Some think that they are some kind of umbrella stand, or maybe a place for cannon balls. However, their use is much more utilitarian. They were there to help put out torches before one would enter an enclosed and flammable building. 

The easiest to find an example of these sockets is the market hall entrance on the old square, where they line the main gate entrance. But many more examples can be found.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sculpted in bronze by Cocoa Beach artist Tasha Drazich and located at the north end of Downtown Cocoa Beach, where A1A splits, the Kelly Slater statue honors Florida's Space Coast hometown hero. Slater grew up in Cocoa Beach and learned to surf all along the Space Coast.

Slater has won 11 world titles and is a point of pride in the Space Coast community. Slater is widely regarded as the greatest professional surfer of all time and holds 56 Championship Tour victories. Slater is also the oldest surfer still active in the World Surf League and won his eighth title at age 49.

However, the statue is located along a highway median, not at the beach. There is a lot of talk locally to move the statue to somewhere with a crosswalk. There is parking on either side in parking lots, but visitors have to cross a two-lane highway.]]></summary>

Shibam, the city known for the high concentration of high-rise mud buildings, is a mere 20 kilometers away. While Seiyun may not have the iconic status that its neighboring city enjoys, it is home to one of the largest mud buildings in the world: the Sultan Al Kathiri Palace (aka Seyun Palace). This seven-story palace boasts a total of 45 rooms. Under the white coating is a structure built according to ancient mud-building techniques. 

Although a much more ancient military structure existed on this site, the construction of the Sultan Al Kathiri Palace as it has survived into the 21st century was completed in the 1920s. The appellation Kathiri refers to the Sultanate of Kathiri, which began ruling this part of Hadhramaut in …]]></summary>

Mazes have existed for thousands of years and might be thought of as the very first puzzles in the world; based on the number of people who’ve likely solved them over the years, they might be the most popular form ever. So it is natural that many puzzle creators, including the readers of Puzzle Communication Nikoli, Japan’s influential, reader-driven puzzle magazine, would try to adapt them to the style of grid puzzle that the publication made famous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spread over 80 square meters and surrounded by meadows, Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns seem so out of place that for a long time, these columns were thought to have been the floor of a church that no longer exists. This belief was not completely implausible, considering that the first settlers on the island were probably Irish Hermits.  If this had been the case, they would most likely have built a church. These are all conjectures, but even if proven true, it is now clear that Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns was definitely not a human creation, but a natural one.

Like basalt columns elsewhere in the world, those in Kirkjugólf are the product of lava cooling. As lava cools, it contracts, and as it contracts, it cracks. The cracks start at the very bottom of the lava field and travel vertically to the top, a process that results in the creation of columns. Sharp contours and repetitive patterns make these sites seem like they were sculpted by a human hand.   

Descriptions of the Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns often report that they consist of hexagonal columns, but even this detail is misleading, for there is no shortage of pentagons, heptagons, and octagons. Yet, in spite of the variety of shapes (or more likely because of it), these columns fit in perfectly next to one another, leaving only a narrow, consistent gap between them.

Of note, the nearby village of Kirkjugólf was named after the basalt columns, and it literally means “the church floor.”  Following the discovery of its natural origins, the basalt columns were given the less-imaginative name of “Kirkjugólf Natural Monument.”]]></summary>

Despite its relatively short career, the Arizona was present for several notable events and today the battleship is memorialized within the Capitol building of its namesake.

The Arizona spent World War I mostly in the United States, primarily used in training missions and only sailing across the Atlantic Ocean after the armistice ending the war had been signed. The Arizona was part of the convoy escorting President Woodrow Wilson to Europe for the Paris Peace Conference and later part of the fleet that escorted him back to the United St…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fairplay, Colorado started as a mining camp under the name of South Park City. In the 19th century, "park” was a common term in the Western United States for a wide valley, and Fairplay is located in South Park. (The animated sitcom is set in the same area.) Hence, this re-creation of a late 19th-century camp at the edge of modern Fairplay uses the original name. It consists of some 44 period buildings, seven of which are original. The rest were moved in from other old mining towns in the area. 

The buildings include mock-ups of businesses typical in a settlement like this, including a blacksmith shop, livery stable, hotel, dry goods store, drugstore, carpenter shop (which doubled as a funeral parlor), assay office, print shop, and so on. There are also living quarters, a church, a school, and even a mine and a locomotive. Contemporary equipment such as mining tools, carriages, and wagons are also extensively displayed.

Unpaved streets run between the buildings, some with authentic boardwalks, and you can wander around as much you wish. Sometimes exhibitions of 19th-century trades such as blacksmithing are also presented.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gaby Contardo (SISSA) completed her visit to Heidelberg today. Over coffee this morning she delivered a very simple, but very nice insight about machine learning outputs. Apologies that this is very Inside Baseball:
As I like to emphasize, you can't really average (or do any populations inferences with) a collection of labels delivered by a discriminative ML method run on a collection of objects. Think: Finding the mean age of a cluster, where each star in the cluster got an age estimate from a discriminative ML method trained on stars with known ages. This is because the discriminative ML methods output something very akin to posterior quantities, and if you average a bunch of posterior estimates, you are multiplying in a prior times itself many times; eventually the prior dominates the inference (in many cases).
Contardo's point: If what you want is a label for a collection of objects, like that mean age, you should train on . That is, make a training set where you have sets of N stars, labeled by mean age. Then this model can be applied to a new collection of stars and deliver a mean age estimate! Haha, brilliant. And correct. And consistent with the rules of inference.collections of objects]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden River Cave is wonderful and unique because of the tremendous amount of history associated with it. John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, stopped by for a visit in 1867 and detailed his experience in his 1916 book Thousand Mile Walk To The Gulf. The cave was once a source of drinking water and hydroelectricity for the City of Horse Cave and the remnants of the equipment are still visible during the cave tour. 

Electricity generated from the cave stream powered the home above the cave, which included a dentist's office and two other buildings in town. Horse Cave was actually the first town in Kentucky to have incandescent lights. The cave operated for commercial tours from 1916-1943, until household waste from businesses and the community above polluted the cave streams.

The cave remained closed until 1992, when the combined efforts of local leaders and the nonprofit American Cave Conservation Association (ACCA) joined forces to clean up and restore the subterranean site. A regional sewage treatment system went online in 1989, which stopped pollution from entering the cave. This allowed nature to take its course and Hidden River Cave is now considered to be an environmental success story. The ACCA also opened the American Cave Museum in the entrance to the cave in 1992.

Today, tour guides explain Hidden River Cave’s history and general information about caves, the animals that inhabit them, and some of the uses of caves. This tour is not only entertaining, it is educational.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opened in December 2022, Babka & Krantz bears the distinction of being the only Jewish bakery in Berlin’s 750-year-old bakers' guild, or the Bäcker-Innung Berlin. Being accepted into the prestigious association is no easy feat. Certain standards for craftsmanship and quality, as well as a commitment to upholding traditional baking techniques, must be met by every bakery to be approved. Plus, Germany has stringent regulations for becoming a certified baker including formal education and vocational training.

The concept here revolves around a fusion of Eastern European and Israeli cuisines, with a focus on traditional Jewish pastries. Owners Marcin Liera-Elkin and Shahar Elkin dole out their favorite sweet and savory pastries, including two versions of braided bread inspiring the shop’s name: babka baked according to Marcin’s Polish grandmother recipe, as well as krantz from Shahar’s homeland Israel.

Over 90 percent of the baked goods are made using organic ingredients, and the house-made yeast dough is allowed to rest for up to 48 hours. The bakery's warm and inviting atmosphere, coupled with delectable offerings, has made it a popular haven in the capital’s up-and-coming Friedenau neighborhood. It’s the perfect place to spend a couple of hours sipping coffee and savoring a sweet hazelnut babka with creamy nougat cream or a savory Sabich bagel, seasoned with zaatar and topped with aubergine and hummus, are definite favorites.

The inclusion of Babka & Krantz as the first Jewish bakery in the guild is a remarkable milestone, highlighting the evolving nature of Berlin's gastronomic landscape and the celebration of diverse cultural influences within the city's vibrant food scene. The bakery has become an integral part of Berlin’s steadily growing Jewish community, particularly among Israeli expats (by some figures, more than 10,000 have moved to Berlin in the last decade). It's a testament to the power of good food and the importance of preserving culinary traditions for future generations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Southern Utah has spectacular scenery, but for pioneers trying to carry out agriculture in these arid lands an adequate water supply was an ongoing problem.

This led to some extraordinary water diversion projects, including the Tropic Ditch. Water was diverted from the East Fork of the Sevier River, atop the Paunsaugunt Plateau west of the present location of Bryce Canyon National Park, to Bryce Valley. Construction began in 1890 and the Ditch was completed in 1892. It was built entirely with muscle power, using hand tools and draft animals. It extends easterly some 10 miles to the town of Tropic, which relies on its water to this day.

To minimize excavation, a critical consideration with no earth-moving equipment, natural watercourses were used as much as possible. In particular, an ordinarily dry east-draining watercourse, now called Water Canyon, became a major part of the ditch. Water Canyon crosses what is now Bryce Canyon National Park, but is still in use as it was grandfathered in when the Park was created.]]></summary>

Lima Syndrome is when the hostage takers start sympathizing with the hostages. And London Syndrome is when hostages become argumentative toward their captors—often with deadly results.

I've been playing soccer my whole life. I played competitively from when I was seven years old until I graduated high school. Mostly, though, I just remember being bad at it. I remember I played for the brown or blue team, and we were the worst team. I always wanted to be on the black team. The black team was really good and I was never allowed on it.

But then, in middle school, that all changed. I still wasn’t the best soccer player, but I became obsessed with the game. More specifically, I became obsessed with London’s Chelsea Football Club.

An Exclusive Look at the Los Alamos Lab Where Oppenheimer Created the Bomb

by Jennie Rothenberg Gritz, Smithsonian Magazine

Los Alamos, New Mexico, is still an active national laboratory, and the sites where Manhattan Project scientists developed the first nuclear weapon remain off limits to the public. But photographer Minesh Bacrania, a physicist who worked in the lab’s nonproliferation division from 2006 to 2012, received special permission to take photographs for Smithsonian Magazine, providing a never-before-seen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loupin' Stanes is a stone circle sat on a low platform above the River Esk. The rough stone circle has two large stones marking the entrance at the southwest side. The rest of the stone circle is made up of 10 stones.

There are also stones scattered around the exterior of the stone circle, their role in the site is uncertain. Further along, the Esk are the remains of another stone circle, Girdle Stanes. Girdle Stanes was once made up of 40 or 45 stones, over time, the Esk has changed course and it swept away part of the stone circle. Around 21 stones remain in place, one precariously balanced beyond the fence on the edge of the river bank.

It's thought that the entrance would have been located on the southeast side. The proximity of the two circles is unusual. Questions remain about why two such different style circles were built so close together. It's uncertain which was built first, although one belief is that Loupin' Stanes was built to replace Girdle Stanes after it was damaged.

There are also two recumbent stones between the two stone circles. Questions also remain about their purpose, were they some way of connecting the damaged stone circle with the smaller circle.]]></summary>

He has arc images from each night, and line lists for the arc lamps. But before even using the arc lamps, I recommended that he try to find a model for the 2D images that is an outer product of 1D functions: One is the intensity as a function of wavelength from the arc lamp, and the other is the intensity as a function of slit position from the fibers on the slithead.
The thing we realized in the call is that the coordinate system is right when the image is well described as the outer product of these two functions, warped according to that coordinate system! Okay that's nice, now what will the residuals look like? One issue is that there are cosmic rays, hot pixels, and so on. Another issue is that there will be some vignetting that violates the strict outer-product model. We'll address these issues once we get close.]]></summary>

As one steps into the establishment, one is instantly transported a hundred years back in time. Vaidya Upahar Gruha has been serving patrons delicious food since 1912. The atmospheric interior drips with vintage charm in the form of marble-topped tables decorated with artistic ironwork, antique mirrors, and classical old paintings adorning the walls.

The menu remains largely unchanged since the 1960s. Even today, the owners continue to serve their signature dishes which they have perfected over the decades. Misal pav, a traditional Maharashtrian bean curry, is their best-selling dish and they have their own version of it, which has delighted patrons time and again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Japan, shopping streets that run towards major shrines or temples are quite common and often known as omote-sandō or nakamise. Quaint and busy, they typically boast a number of souvenir shops, teahouses, and restaurants, some of which may be more than a century old.

Even on such streets, international chains such as McDonald’s and Starbucks are not uncommon. But some of their outlets, such as the Ninenzaka location in Kyoto, go the extra mile to fit into the area, incorporating unique designs. Such Starbucks outlets are officially called Regional Landmark Stores and currently 28 of them exist across Japan (out of 1,800-odd locations).

The Dazaifu Tenmangu Omote-Sando location, however, stands out with its striking modernist design. Jutting out of its façade is an interwoven web of cedar timber, slotted together diagonally and leading visitors into the dreamlike interior.

Designed by renowned architect Kengo Kuma, the bizarre lattice was made using a traditional method of Japanese architecture called kigumi. By slotting cut pieces of wood together, it can create the framework and keep it solid without the use of nails, making the structure especially durable and resistant to rust.

Natural and soothing, the creamy brown timber seems to radiate illumination all by itself… and it does. Almost. Some of the lights are actually embedded in the tip of the wood, such as those hanging above the counter.

In addition to the lighting, Kuma also took charge of the interior design down to the smallest detail, from the miniature garden at the entrance to the comfortability of the couches. At the back behind a glass wall is another garden, where a plum tree—the symbol of Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine—stands, also doubling as a smoking area.]]></summary>

Barbie cakes have been a special birthday request for decades. Instead of a standard sheet cake, bakers frost a dome-shaped layer to resemble a giant ballgown skirt. A Barbie doll is then inserted into the top and iced with a matching blouse to complement the rest of her sweet outfit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mexico City is known for its number of museums. Many residents of the city and Mexicans in general, actually believe it to be the city with the most museums in the world. Most serious attempts at counting city museums seem to provide widely varying results, depending on membership to organizations, definitions of what counts as a museum, and city limits. However, the top three spots consistently seem to be contested between Paris, Moscow, and London, with Mexico City often appearing in the top 10. Among such museo-graphical wealth, some spaces need to offer something that makes them stand out.

The Photography Archive Museum isn't even the city's only museum dedicated exclusively to photography, so in order to draw in visitors, it offers heavily-themed exhibits. In early 2022 for example, pictures showcasing Mexico City markets were enhanced with piñatas, dried herbs, kitchen supplies, and many of the other items one would find for sale in these spaces.

Since its opening in 2006, in a 16th-century building known as Las Casa de las Ajaracas (House of Ajaracas, after the architectural features that define its facade), the museum has showcased several exhibitions with added features as varied as the reproduction of a dark room, a collection of bicycles, and others.

Greenhead, a town previously known for its wildflowers and pristine beaches, is now abuzz with an international mystery. Theories about the identity of the object have raged on the internet—from a piece of a passing ship, to a pressurized tank, to a part of Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which went missing over the Indian Ocean in 2014.

The encrusted object is now being held in a secure storage facility for further investigation. The Australian Space Agency subsequently tweeted: “The object could be from a foreign space launch vehicle and we are liaising with global counterparts who may be able to provide more information.”

Not long ago, lava raced through this cave on La Palma, in the Spanish Canary Islands.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the central Piazza Garibaldi is the Governor's Palace, the original building of which dates back to the 13th century. After undergoing numerous changes, its present form dates back to the second half of the 18th century. If you look carefully at the part of the palace on the corner of Via Cavour, you will notice the sample of the "Parmesan brick," the ancient unit of measurement of Parmesan builders, embedded and framed in the wall.

It measures approximately 28 centimeters long, 12 centimeters wide, and 5.6 centimeters thick. The brick measure, displayed in antiquity by the kilnsmen, served to prevent the placing on the market of dwindling sizes and the resulting fraud.

The ancient Italian units of measurement were local units in use throughout the centuries in different parts of Italy. Although they often had similar names, they had very different origins and values. As early as the 11th century, the different local realities realized their own units of measurement. Over time, boundary changes led to heterogeneous units of measurement being brought together under the same administration with obvious problems for duties, taxation, and trade. Rare and not very fruitful were some attempts at unifying units of measurement, for which it would be necessary to wait until the 19th century, when local units of measurement were gradually replaced by the metric system.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden behind a wall, which feels like a prison yard, a striking memorial attempts to commemorate and give a brief timeline of the events leading up to 19 men being hanged as Molly Maguires between 1877 and 1879 in the Pennsylvania coal region.

The bronze statue was created by Zenos Frudakis and erected in 2009 in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. The imagery of the statue is of an anonymous man with his hands and feet both bound by rope and a hood over his head, as he waits for the gallows.

Molly Maguires were Irish immigrants that worked in the anthracite mines in Schuylkill, Carbon, Luzerne, Columbia, and Northumberland Counties in Pennsylvania. At least 19 miners were hanged between 1877 and 1879 for crimes associated with the Molly Maguires group, who were fighting with mine owners for basic living rights. 
The miners at the time were treated poorly, with low wages and awful working conditions. The miners felt they were being taken advantage of and exploited by the mine owners, and formed the Molly McGuires. (The name comes from early 19th-century Ireland, when a woman named Molly Maguire protested against English landlords who tried to steal people's land.)
 Both sides during this conflict resorted to violence, with many people dying on both sides from murders to suspicious deaths to dynamiting of mines to close the mines so that the mine owners lost money. Both sides blamed the other side whenever anything went wrong, and would fight back with violence. 
 Chronologically, the trials of the Molly McGuires ended on January 14, 1879, when Martin Bergin, the 19th Molly was executed and hung in Pottsville for the murder of Patrick Burns. 
 The monument pays tribute to all the miners that lost their lives during this time, there is a black plaque dedicated to them with their names inscribed. The dedication marker lists "Sir Sean Connery" as chairman of the advisory committee. Connery played the lead role in the fictional movie, The Molly Maguires.]]></summary>

We have some candidates, which range in temperature from 300 to 1500 K and are reprocessing maybe one percent or a fraction of a percent of the stellar light.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The southern Reveille Range, west of Nevada State Route 375, the famed Extraterrestrial Highway, is unusual among Nevada mountain ranges in containing no potential economic mineralization. No doubt, prospectors swarmed over the area back in the day, but they found nothing to warrant further effort. The result is that this area is not seamed with roads and jeep trails connecting adits, prospect pits, abandoned buildings, spoil heaps, and other mining residua. The southern Reveille Range is an almost untouched piece of nature. 

A highlight of the range is Fang Ridge, a ridge of red rock spires running east to west, perpendicular to the main range. The "fangs" are composed of dacite, a hard volcanic rock, which is sturdy enough to attract nearby rock climbers. The fangs reach an elevation of some 6,000 feet above sea level.

The only road into the south Reveille Range runs along the south side of Fang Ridge, which provides easy access to the pristine landscape. This road runs by Pyramid Spring, one of the handful of perennial water sources in the range, and continues for another half mile. It ends at a wide parking area below the ridge. The site was used for radiation monitoring back when nuclear testing was being carried out on the Nevada Test Site to the south.]]></summary>

"We do not ask you to go there for the purpose of making sensational revelations. Write up things as you find them, good or bad; give praise or blame as you think best, and the truth all the time. But I am afraid of that chronic smile of yours," her editor told her, as recorded in the 35,000-word exposé, Ten Days In a Mad-House. "I will smile no more," replied Bly. 

Bly, who went undercover as Nellie Brown, found much to "give blame." Bly spent a total of 10 days in the asylum on Blackwell’s Island in New York’s East River, now known as Roosevelt Island, and before that as Minnehanonck among Indigenous Lenape people. …]]></summary>

Here's more information about the current situation around the Darién Gap, plus ways to help.

In the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, crocodiles sunbathe along the muddy banks that line the steep cliffs of Sumidero Canyon. On the small, rural island of Tashirojima, off the coast of eastern Japan, cats lounge peacefully as waves tickle the shore of “Cat Island.” From June to September in Manitoba, some 3,000 beluga whales sing and swim their way along northern Canada’s Churchill River. With a bit of luck, you may even find yourself eye to eye with some of these incredible creatures as they’re busy migrating, raising their young, and getting their tan on during the warm summer months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the small town of Ellsworth, Maine, stands a structure that's as fascinating as it is improbable: a barn that's home to neither poultry nor livestock, but an astonishing assortment of antiques and books. The Big Chicken Barn, stretching over 21,000 square feet, is a testament to the unusual, the nostalgic, and the whimsical.

The barn's name is not a misnomer, but a nod to its history. Erected in the 1950s, the massive structure initially served as a chicken house for over 20,000 hens. Today, however, its wooden floors echo with the soft rustle of flipping pages and the murmur of intrigued visitors.

The barn's upper level teems with antiques, from vintage furniture and rustic kitchenware to historical memorabilia and quirky collectibles. Each piece tells a story, transporting the onlooker to a bygone era.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nicknamed the "city of ghosts," An Bang Cemetery is an impressible display of artistic construction and wealth. 
The history of An Bang Cemetery is intertwined with the emigration of residents from An Bang Village to Europe and the United States after the reunification of Vietnam in 1975. These emigrants sent money back to their relatives, making An Bang one of the wealthiest villages in the country. The affluence of the town is evident in the grand houses and neatly paved driveways seen while driving through the streets. The residents dedicate their time to constructing extravagant mausoleums within the 250-hectare cemetery, adjacent to a beautiful, empty sandy beach. 

The building of these structures began in 1995 and has since become increasingly lavish, often reaching two or three stories high. Adorned with intricate gold carvings of dragons and mythical creatures, these mausoleums even feature fully functional bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens. This lavish display reflects not only the residents' opulent lifestyle but also their strong belief in the afterlife and the importance of honoring their ancestors.

According to their beliefs, meticulously caring for and decorating the tombs will bring good fortune to the family. The cost of constructing these tombs can reach as much as £50,000 (GBP), an extraordinary amount in a country where poverty is prevalent. Visiting this unique cemetery, surrounded by towering tombs, gives a ghostly and awe-inspiring experience, allowing one to imagine the splendid kingdom where the spirits of ancestors reside.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visoki Dečani Monastery is a medieval Serbian Orthodox Christian monastery located in Kosovo. It is renowned for its historical and cultural significance, as well as its remarkable architecture and religious art.
The Visoki Dečani Monastery was built in the mid-14th century (between 1327 and 1335) by King Stefan Dečanski of Serbia. It was established as a royal endowment and served as a mausoleum for the Nemanjić dynasty. Representing the height of Serbian medieval architecture, encompassing both Byzantine and Romanesque styles with distinct Serbian elements, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2004. It represents the historical and artistic achievements of Serbia in this area.

The monastery complex consists of the main church, several chapels, monk cells, and a defensive wall. Furthermore, frescoes cover the walls and ceilings of the main church, depicting biblical scenes, saints, and the lives of Serbian rulers. The art is renowned for its vivid colors, detailed craftsmanship, and spiritual expression. It serves as a place of worship, pilgrimage, and cultural preservation, playing a vital role in maintaining the Serbian Orthodox Christian tradition.
Despite the complex political situation in the region, Visoki Dečani Monastery remains a prominent spiritual and cultural destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to admire its beauty and learn about its rich history. It is amongst the top most endangered cultural sites in Europe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reed Gold Mine is the first documented commercial gold found in the United States, triggering the first gold rush. The land was owned by John Reed, a former Hessian soldier, who fought for the British in the Revolutionary War. Reed and his family settled onto a farmstead in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, Northeast of Charlotte. 

The story of the gold discovery began in 1799 when Reed's son found a large yellow rock in a nearby creek. The rock weighed 17 pounds. Not originally recognized as gold, legend has it that the family used the rock as the doorstop for the family house. 

A nearby jeweler from Fayetteville identified the rock as gold in 1802 while visiting the home. It was purchased for a portion of its true worth. Eventually, word got out and gold was discovered in nearby creeks and land, triggering a gold rush. At its peak, the estimated value mined each year in the mine and surrounding areas topped over one million dollars, including a 28-pound gold nugget that was also found at Reed's farm.]]></summary>

On ski trips to the mountains of Uludağ, “we'd always end the cold and tiring day with a salep,” he says. Özcan, who left Turkey in 2013, is one of the many Turkish people living abroad who thirsts for salep. “I tried to quench it with eggnog a couple times, but it didn't cut it for me,” he says.

Much like eggnog, salep is a staple winter drink, and it is enjoyed throughout Turkey, Greece, and parts of the Middle East. Part comfort food and part medicine, it is a popular folk remedy for everything from stomachache to impotence.

The planting includes approximately 300 mature trees. Although beautiful at all times of the year, the grove is especially stunning in the autumn. Beginning in late October, the trees put on a spectacular display as their fan-shaped leaves turn from bright green to brilliant yellow. As the leaves fall, they carpet the grove in drifts of yellow and gold.

The genesis of the Ginkgo Grove Garden was an experiment by Dr. Orlando E. White, Blandy's first director. Because Ginkgo trees are dioecious, (either male or female), White hypothesized that a random planting of Gingko seeds would result in a 1:1 ratio of male …]]></summary>

It was founded in 1875 and was formerly called the Poona Industrial Museum. Later it was renamed Lord Reay Industrial Museum and in 1968, it was renamed once again, this time to the Mahatma Phule Museum.

At the entrance, in the spacious courtyard, is a circle fenced with artistic pillars and a chain. Within this circle stands an imposing piece of artillery on two gigantic wheels. An information plaque describes this gun to be a 12-pound howitzer.

This type of weapon could fire cannonballs or other projectiles of 12 pounds from its barrel. According to experts, a howitzer falls between a cannon and a mortar with long-range capabilities. The plaque also mentions that this particular gun was manufactured in 1859 in Bengal (now West Bengal).]]></summary>

If one wanders just a bit farther, the community of Oro-Medonte occupies the open land between Kempenfelt Bay on Lake Simcoe and the southern tip of Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. The land in this region formed the backbone of British supply lines between the Great Lakes during the War of 1812. In the years following that conflict, the fear of a restrengthened America invading once more was considered a very real possibility.

In order to secure the main supply route between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay, a rough-hewn path was cut through the wilderness. This route would come to be known as the Penetanguishene Road, named after the naval establishment located at its northernmost point. It was decided by the government…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pronghorn antelope, which is not a true antelope, is unique to North America and is the sole surviving representative of a separate group of ruminants. They were hunted nearly to extinction—it's estimated that there were only about 14,000 individuals left by 1914. Due to extensive conservation efforts, the species has recovered, with around a million animals alive today.

A major factor in the pronghorn's recovery was the establishment of dedicated wildlife refuges in the early 20th century. The largest was the Sheldon Antelope Refuge in the northwest corner of Nevada next to the Oregon line. It began with the purchase of 34,000 acres at Last Chance Ranch in 1931. In 1936, President Roosevelt added over 540,000 adjacent acres of Federal lands, with the total acreage combined into a single wildlife refuge. At present, the refuge is managed in conjunction with the smaller Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge in Oregon, which was created at the same time.

The Sheldon Refuge consists of high desert steppe, including tilted tablelands and deep canyons (such as Thousand Creek Gorge, which overlaps the refuge slightly on the east side). It encloses the Virgin Valley opal mines, which were grandfathered in. Virgin Valley is also the site of the current refuge headquarters, as well as the Dufurrena Ponds, which provide waterfowl habitat and are open to fishing with a Nevada license.

The Last Chance Ranch was the original heart of the refuge, and indeed served as the headquarters in the early years. The ranch building is still preserved as a historical site.]]></summary>

The building dates from the early 1960s and was erected in place of its predecessor which was bombed during warfare. It was the first skyscraper in the area and was built to impress. Designed by the Hermann Henselmann, B. Geyer, and J. Streitparth architect collective, this 12-story high-rise was at its time Europe's most advanced center for teachers and educators—sporting a huge library behind the three-story spanning mosaic that held over 650,000 books, but also a cafe, restaurant, bar, bookshop, and cabaret. 

The mosaic itself was designed and implemented by Walter Womacka and uses a staggering 800,000 stones. The work of art is titled "Our Life" and showcases idealistic snippets of socialist life in East Germany, with a special focus on educators. The style is made in that of Mexican mural art and it is one of thelargest works of art in Europe.]]></summary>

Along with Roman artifacts from various eras, tools from the Punic and Neo-Punic traditions were discovered inside. The final period of the cemetery's habitation began at the end of the 4th century BCE.

For housing a cemetery of 98 tombs, of which more than 50 are carved in coffered rock, the holes in the ground have managed to withstand the passing of time. The necropolis is also a meeting place that enriches social coexistence—widely frequented by residents of the city and tourists that want to enjoy a fantastic view.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shunpiking is defined as  "the act of deliberately avoiding roads that require payment of a fee or toll to travel on them, usually by traveling on alternative 'free' roads which bypass the toll."

One of the first instances in America occurred along the Mohawk Trail, in Charlemont, Massachusettes. 

A road for stagecoaches was built over the Hoosac Range in the northwestern part of the state in 1787, and the road came under the control of the Turnpike Association in 1797. That year, travelers of the Mohawk Trail forded the Deerfield River rather than pay the toll at the turnpike bridge. In 1810, they won the battle for free travel on all Massachusetts roads.

The act is memorialized by the historical marker at the Shunkpike Rest Stop. This portion of the river is now used for tubing and fishing in the warmer months.]]></summary>

The statehouse is constructed of Columbus Limestone, which was formed from sediments deposited around 390–405 million years ago during the Devonian Period when what would become Ohio was a warm, shallow sea. The corals, sponges, and shelled animals of the sea make up this limestone, and the statehouse is one of the best places for the public to view these fossils where the limestone is used for the walls. 

Crown Point Limestone, used as floor tile, was sourced from quarries in Isle La Motte, Vermont. This limestone from the Late Ordovician Period, about 459 million years old, showcases major groups of invertebrates also occurring in Columbus Limestone with the addition of marine gastropods.]]></summary>

The sabertooth cat is an Ice Age icon and emblem of strength, tenacity, and intelligence. These animals shared the North American landscape with other large carnivores, including short-faced bears, dire wolves, and the American lion, as well as megaherbivores including mammoths, mastodons, muskoxen, and long-horned bison. Then at the end of the Pleistocene, between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, they all vanished. The only place to see them now is in the fossil record.

Carnivore fossils are extremely rare, though, in comparison to those of their prey. Prey are always more abundant than predators in a healthy ecosystem. So the probability of burial, storage and discovery of carnivo…]]></summary>

When Christopher Columbus bumbled his way into the Bahamas in 1492, his crew must have been relieved—if only for a break from leathery salted beef and hardtack biscuits softened in water-flavored wine. On a later voyage, Columbus’s son Ferdinand wrote, “What with the heat and dampness, our ship biscuit had become so wormy that, God help me, I saw many who waited for darkness to eat porridge made of it, that they might not see the maggots.”

In 1519, when Ferdinand Magellan vowed to circumnavigate the Earth on a two-year voyage with five ships and 239 men, he set forth with 2,626 kilos of aged bacon, 1,547 liters of dried beans, 1,293 kilos of cheese, 140 barrels …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a conversation with Vedant Chandra (Harvard) today about how catalogs are used, and how that relates to how they are built. We started off by arguing about how principled one should be about doing a populations inference. Too abstract! So Chandra moved us in the pragmatic direction: Let's look at a very specific inference and see what matters about it. We decided to look at the distances to distant clusters in the ESA  data: How do your inferences depend on the number of stars you use, the signal-to-noise ratios of those stars, and whether your individual-star measurements are maximum-likelihood or obtained by consideration of a posterior pdf? That should answer questions, and set up some concrete points of discussion.Gaia]]></summary>

Visitors who walk up to the gate, dirt crunching under their feet, will likely encounter a dog lazing about and bougainvillea waving gently in the breeze. After passing through the 19th century–style kitchen, filled with dark-red earthenware pottery, old cookbooks, and the smell of smoke, they’ll sit beneath a tin roof and watch as women use pre-Columbian tools to make tostadas raspadas (“scraped” tostadas), grinding corn with a metate and cooking with a traditional firewood stove known as a tecuil. Everything, from the menu to the equipment to the décor, is meant to evoke the historic, nearly-forgotten traditional kitchens of Jalisco.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cristina Ortiz, the colorful Spanish media personality better known as La Veneno (“The Poison”), never called herself a role model: indeed, her autobiography is subtitled “Ni puta ni santa,” (“Neither a Whore nor a Saint”). Yet thanks to her unapologetic openness about her struggles as a trans woman (not to mention her inexhaustible repertoire of catchphrases), Ortiz has become something of a patron saint to Spain’s queer community since her death in 2016.

“Brave trans woman visible in the 90s,” reads the diamond-shaped plaque that adorns Ortiz’s monument in the West Park of Madrid, which stands in the place where she was “discovered” late one night in 1996. At the time, Ortiz was a sex worker in the park–one of the only jobs she could get, due to discrimination–when a TV reporter approa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there is one novel associated with Kensington Gardens, it would most likely be J. M. Barrie's 1911 blockbuster Peter Pan and Wendy. What many people might not know, however, is that the character of Peter Pan was a literary creation for adults before he became "the boy who wouldn't grow up." In 1906, the mischievous entity was featured in a book entitled Peter Pan and Kensington Gardens. This tome was comprised of a collection of short stories involving the adventures of our titular hero, taking place in the surrounding environs.

One such episode is a rather somber and macabre tale, involving two children who were lost or became abandoned, once the park's gates had closed for the evening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zamora is famous all over Spain because of its Holy Week processions, and all of them start the moment Barandales makes his bells ring. He is the first person you see (and hear) at he start of every procession. Without this person, Zamora and its Holy Week would not be the same.

Barandales is a well-known figure in charge of signaling the approach of the several Zamora Passion processions. His distinguishing features include two large bells that hang from his wrists, which he constantly rings to alert locals and guests of the procession's approach. With his emblematic jingle, the crowd goes silent to show respect for the religious ceremony.

Being "el Barandales" is a complete honor for locals of Zamora and it used to be an hereditary position. Nowadays every cofradía (group of penitents taking part in a procession) appoints their own Barandales.

The bronze statue of Barandales is the work of sculptor Ricardo Flecha and it was made in 1994. The statue is located in the Plaza de Santa María la Nueva, in front of the Museum of Holy Week, where some of the best images of the Holy Week in Zamora can be found. Barandales statue is the homage to the fifth centenary of the foundation of the Brotherhood of the Holy Burial.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alma Woodsey Thomas was born in Columbus, Georgia, on September 22, 1891. She moved to Washington, D.C., in 1907 with her family who were seeking educational opportunities that were not as easy to come by in the South during the Jim Crow era. Thomas attended Howard University and initially studied costume design before changing course at the urging of a professor, James Vernon Herring, who entreated her to become the first student in the new art department.

After graduating in 1924 with a degree in fine arts (and perhaps the first Black woman in the country to do so), she shared her gift by becoming a teacher. She plied her trade at Shaw Jr. High from 1925 until 1960.

She remained busy during her 35 years as an educator. In 1934, she earned her master's degree from Teachers College of Columbia. Four years later, she created the first art gallery in the D.C. public school system. In 1943, she collaborated with her former professor James Herring and artist Alonzo J. Aden to create one of the first African American art galleries in the U.S., the Barnett Aden Gallery.

She returned her focus to her own art in the 1950s and developed an emphasis on color while working with other artists at American University. Concurrently, she took an interest in the Washington Color School, whose works consisted of abstract shapes of pure color.

In 1964, Thomas suffered an arthritic attack that she feared might render her unable to continue painting, but she persevered and altered her style to capture the natural beauty she saw outside her window. She continued to thrive into her 70s, and in 1972, she had exhibitions at the Whitney Gallery and the Corcoran Art Gallery.

Alma Thomas died on February 24, 1978. In 2016, almost 40 years after her passing, one of her abstract paintings from 1966 entitled Resurrection became the first painting by a Black woman to hang in the White House. Another one of Thomas's paintings, entitled Pansies In Washington, hangs in the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/donum-estate-california"/>
        <updated>2023-07-14T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the outside, nothing seems out of the ordinary when pulling up to the front gate of the Donum Estate. As far as the eye can see, there are rows of grapes just like every other winery in Sonoma County. It's only once security opens up the gate and tells you to "stay to the right of the giant head" that the surreal atmosphere begins to creep in.

On the drive up to the main house, vineyards full of the highest-scoring pinot noirs in the world are ignored as all attention is focused on the few contemporary sculptures in sight, some blending into the California landscape much better than others. Finally, by the time you reach the end of the driveway, you aren't greeted with some grandiose Victorian mansion, but rather a quaint, 1-story Scandinavian-influenced house. This is the Donum Estate: a place where oenophilia meets modern art that is somewhat reminiscent of Bond villain's evil lair.

Founded by Allan and Mei Warburg, the Donum Estate spans around 200 acres and is home to over 50 pieces of art, heavily influenced by the couple's own ethnic backgrounds. Some of the more famous pieces include: Love Me, a giant mirrored steel heart sculpture symbolically overlooking the entire estate, and Love (Gold/Red), the iconic pop art image created by Robert Indiana that gained fame in Philadelphia's John F. Kennedy Plaza. There is also Crouching Spider, which, as you can guess, is a massive steel spider carefully tucked into an undistinguishable space to possibly get the jump on arachnophobes.

Although its fascinating art collection makes Donum quite memorable, that isn’t the only draw of the estate. What would a world-famous vineyard be without offering a wine tasting! If you are able to secure an exclusive reservation, the Donum Estate offers several different types of tastings. Just make sure to save up for the experience because it can end up being quite pricey, especially if you order a few bottles to go!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FitzGerald Bridge, also popularly known as the Bund Garden Bridge is an important crossing over the Mula-Mutha river in Pune. Named after Sir William Robert Seymour Vesey-FitzGerald, the erstwhile Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) from 1867 to 1872, it was designed and constructed by Captain Robert S. Sellon of the Royal Engineers.

Work commenced in 1866 and was completed in 1867 at a cost of 241,800 Rupees. It was the first spandrel arch bridge in Pune and was formally opened to the public in 1869. On both sides of the bridge, there are statues of two lions looking to the side holding a sphere under a paw. These are representations of the Medici Lions at Villa Medici in Rome.

Today, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic and has been converted into an arts plaza, with seating arrangements and an open space. One can spot the iconic lions from both ends of this heritage structure. They have withstood the test of time and are the proud guardians of this slice of history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day started with a conversation with Wolfgang Brandner (MPIA), who asked me how to figure out the information content of ESA  RVS spectra, but in a data-driven way. He wants to avoid the theoretical models at first; that is, he wants to figure out how precisely the spectra contain temperature and metallicity and age information without having temperatures, metallicities, and ages that we believe. One approach is to compare to other data that are sensitve to temperature, metallicity, and age: If the RVS spectra can predict those data, then (conditioned on assumptions) they must contain information about temperature, metallicity, and age. This is similar to questions of risk (or expected error in prediction) in machine-learning contexts.Gaia]]></summary>

Most of the trains on display at the museum were rescued and fully renovated in recent years. The Madrid metro has made a significant effort to rehabilitate a selection of its vintage trains, which were in operation between 1919 and 1965.

In 1919, Madrid opened its first metro line from Sol to Cuatro Caminos. It was inaugurated on October 17, 1919, by King Alfonso XIII and opened to the public later that month. Some of the trains that serviced the citizens of Madrid on that very first day can be seen in this museum.

The museum is also home to around 100 subway-specific items and videos from a bygone such as old metro signs and tools.]]></summary>

According to the dragon’s press, the fantastic beast is “naturally benevolent, but can also be wild and unpredictable."

So goes the story of The Calais Dragon, created by François Delarozière, one of the artists behind the intricate puppet-automatons known as the Machines of the Isle of Nantes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1834, Athens was a small city of 7,000 residents. When Athens was declared the new capital of Greece on September 18, 1834, a large building boom soon followed. A plot of land in the Makrigianni area, near the Acropolis, was selected for a military hospital. Bavarian military engineer Wilhelm von Weiler designed the building and did so in a German Neo-Romantic style. Construction began in late 1834 and was completed in 1836. The finished military hospital was three stories tall with a large basement and an exterior of coated stone masonry.

An assassination attempt on the prime minister, the death of King Alexander from a monkey bite, and territorial disputes all led to an increase in the resources needed by the Royal Gendarmerie so the building was converted to regimental barracks in 1920.

In 1944, the building fell victim to the Dekemvriana (December events), a 37-day period of fighting in the streets of Athens between British forces supporting the Greek government and communist rebels (who had fought alongside British troops against the Germans just months earlier). The building was badly damaged, with a large portion of the coating destroyed, exposing the stonework. Following the Dekemvriana, most of the remaining coating was removed and the majority of the building exterior was left as exposed stonework.

In 1978, the building was turned over to the Ministry of Culture. Use by the ministry was limited until a full renovation was completed between 1985 and 1987. After renovations were complete, the building was inaugurated by the late Minister for Culture, Melina Mercouri, as the Museum of the Center for Acropolis Studies.

The center now contains as original terracotta architectural remains from the Acropolis, a series of plaster casts depicting successive uses of the Acropolis from prehistoric Neolithic times to the 18th century, and numerous other important artifacts.]]></summary>

I spent this morning on three different small activities. One was giving feedback to Matt Daunt (NYU) who is trying to re-build the  concept for stellar radial-velocity measurement in . He has annoying optimization issues, which are very hard to diagnose! Optimization is always nasty, in my experience.wobblejax
Another activity was working on the abstract for Lily Zhao's (Flatiron) upcoming paper on stellar variability in the spectral domain, generated by rotating, spotty stars. She is concerned that the paper is too conceptual. I love conceptual papers! I think science moves forward through concepts and implentations, and no individual paper has to do it all.
My third activity this morning was working through the mathematics on a project of Abby Williams (NYU, Caltech) to measure the kinematic dipole in the all-sky  quasar catalog. There are so many different ways to measure it. I think I have a justifiable likelihood function approach, and one in which we could marginalize out—or profile out—the uncertainties in the selection function we have estimated. It's a controversial subject, so I would like to do things correctly.Quaia]]></summary>

Beneath this diversity lies one of the world’s largest gold deposits, and, beneath that, more than three miles underground, there’s a geological treasure from deep time: layers of rock that provide evidence of Earth’s earliest deep freeze.

According to a paper published recently in Geochemical Perspectives Letters, these rocks hold multiple clues to the world's oldest glaciers, sheets of ice that covered the area an astonishing 2.9 billion years ago. Now the big question is: What on Earth was the…]]></summary>

At the intersection of Julia and Magazine Streets, the Mistick Krewe of Comus kicked off Fat Tuesday with a parade that marched through the main thoroughfares of the city to the Gaiety Theatre, on Gravier Street between Carondelet and Baronne Streets.

The organized procession coalesced around a single theme, “The Demon Actors in Milton’s Paradise Lost," and featured classic characters from Paradise Lost, such as Pluto and Prosperine, the Fates, fairies, harpies, gorgons, Satan, Isis, Osiris, and many others. Once the parade reached the Gaiety Theatre, members presented four tableaus taken from Paradise Lost: Tartarus, the Expulsion, the conference of Satan and Bee…]]></summary>

A collection of immigrants, Black Americans from the South, and other residents of the various hallows located around the state joined forces to stand up against the mine guard system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since their introduction in the mid-19th century, music boxes have been a very popular novelty in Japan, where they are called orugōru from Dutch Orgel "organ." They are commonly found among the usual souvenirs at tourist gift shops, coming in many shapes and sizes.

Established in 1967 and headquartered in the northern city of Otaru, the Orgel-Doh company is known as one of the largest music box manufacturers in Japan. Its main outlet, dubbed the Otaru Orgel Museum, boasts thousands of items for sale as well as small exhibits of European antiques, automata, and dioramas depicting the history of music boxes.

The "museum" is housed in a huge, three-story brick building built in 1912 as a rice merchant's storehouse, a historic monument worth seeing on its own. Inside, spacious halls with quaint wooden beams and dazzling chandeliers gleam with a multitude of music boxes, many of them lushly decorated. Some are of more traditional kinds, from snow globes to piano-shaped antimony chests in Rococo style, while others are uniquely designed in the forms of princesses, teddy bears, Chinese Zodiac animals, Ferris wheels, and even sushi.

Up on the second floor runs an elegant, lamp-lit corridor with historical exhibits and antique, luxury music boxes such as the Orpheus and the Reuge, as well as a section where local handicrafts are showcased. The third floor is home to a nostalgic attic called The Sound of Dreams, focusing on character-themed music boxes and stationery items, particularly those of Studio Ghibli and Monchchichi.

When visiting, don't forget to take a picture with the icon standing in front of the building: the world's largest steam clock. Made in 1994 by Canadian clockmaker Raymond Saunders, credited as the creator of the world's first steam clock in Gastown, the Otaru Steam Clock is 18 feet tall and plays a five-note melody every 15 minutes, exhaling steam into the air.]]></summary>

It was replaced by a nearby church on Church Lane, which fell into disrepair when the village relocated to higher ground. The lynch gate is Grade II listed. The church happens to be only one of three Art Nouveau churches in England and is the best preserved of the trio.

Its interior is decorated with Art Nouveau and Arts & Crafts styles using mother-of-pearl, walnut, marble, aluminum, and other materials. The designer was Sir William Reynolds-Stevens.

Nearby is Warley Place, which was once the home of Victorian gardener Ellen Willmott. The house no longer exists, but the estate (which includes the former garden) is now a nature reserve run by the Essex Wildlife Trust. Warley Place is free to visit.]]></summary>

Each is made from scrap materials, mostly metal, which was sourced from junkyards and scrap piles. Over the years, the Gerhkes created nearly 800 of these wind sculptures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federico Rubio y Galí was a prominent physician who not only went down in history for his medical discoveries but also his intense involvement in politics and literature. He founded the first Professional School of Nursing in Spain in 1896 and was elected a member of the prestigious Royal College of Surgery in London and the Royal Spanish Academy of Medicine.

His monument, located in Parque del Oeste, is made of white limestone and bronze. It is the work of the Catalan sculptor Miguel Blay Fábregas. The inauguration was carried out by King Alfonso XIII, four years after the death of the doctor in December 1906.

During the Spanish Civil War, the monument was the target of intense crossfire. The fight between Parque del Oeste and the entire campus of Ciudad Universitaria was long and cruel. The monument to Federico Rubio y Galí ended up decapitated by a cannon projectile and pierced by hundreds of bullets.

After the war, the monument was somehow "pardoned," despite the doctor's Republican background, and later rebuilt and left as it is seen today, keeping the bullet holes and the shrapnel scars it had received.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This locomotive was designed in Philadelphia in 1920 and shipped to Florida, where it hauled freight along the coast for over 30 years. In 1951, the engine was purchased by the Georgia-based Gainesville-Midland line and given the number 301. The 301 served this role for eight years, before Gainesville-Midland was purchased by Seaboard Locomotive and the engine was donated to the city of Charlotte for display. 

Once gifted to Charlotte, the 301 was installed at Freedom Park, a beautiful 98-acre park in the heart of the Queen City. Since 1959, this display has served as a monument to the importance that engines of this type once played on rail lines across the country. It also serves as a unique piece of playground equipment, as kids and adults can access the engineer’s cabin for a glimpse into the past. 


The engine can be freely visited at the Freedom Park playground at no cost. Nearby parking is also at no cost.]]></summary>

The monument sits on a beautiful site in the mountains overlooking the Churfirsten mountain range in Switzerland. Bickel built it in a style inspired by Greek temples, with tall marble columns and mosaic murals. The murals on one wall depict a family—man, woman, and the creation of a new life. On the opposite wall, the murals depict the struggles of life and the path to a spiritual awakening.]]></summary>

As pilot Maxime Raynaud banks over the desolate coastline of Morocco’s far south, he can just make out a fishing port, a faded white fortress, and a ruined castle marooned in the sea.

The landing can be tricky, and Raynaud approaches fast to steady his Tecnam P2010 aircraft in the strong crosswinds, avoiding two radio antennae before touching down on a dirt airstrip peppered with small stones. At 2000 feet, the airstrip leaves little margin for error.

“We don’t carry much fuel, and we can’t refuel here,” says Raynaud. “If we made a second approach, we might have to divert.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Radiation is generally seen as a dangerous thing and exposure to it should be minimized. But this hasn't always been the case. In the past radium was seen as a healthy thing and was used in many products. Some of these products remain to this day, like the Japanese radium onsen, where bathing in radium water is believed to be healthy.

Radium onsen is one of the oldest bathhouses in Osaka, dating back to 1952. Apart from a traditional hot bath, they also have a carbonated bath, a cold bath, an electric bath where bathers are shocked with a low amp current.  The infamous radium bath is located outside. The radium ore in the bath is sourced from a now-closed mine in Ningyotoge. Fortunately, the dose is not strong. (Depending on how long you stay in the water, you might get more radiation exposure from flying.)

The water is said to cure all kinds of aches and diseases and is popular with older people for this reason. The onsen even suggests drinking it for added medicinal value, which is much more dangerous in terms of radiation exposure. Nevertheless, no death has been attributed to the onsen.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1688, the Glorious Revolution saw William III and his wife Mary ascend to the English throne, marking the end of Catholic rule under James II.

In tribute to William's reign, an impressive equestrian statue was erected in St James's Square, London. This magnificent sculpture, crafted from bronze, portrays William III as a powerful Roman general, evoking a sense of strength and authority. Despite being dressed in Classical garb, however, William's hairstyle remains true to the late 17th century.

Notably, another aspect of the statue that is true to life can be seen at its base. By the feet of William's horse is the distinctive mound of a molehill. This small inclusion is a reference to the incident in which William's horse stumbled over a molehill at Hampton Court Palace, causing William to fall and sustain injuries that ultimately led to the king's death.

This humble lump, the cause of the king's undignified demise, is said to have led his opposition, most notably the Jacobite supporters of James II, to raise a toast to the mole or as they eloquently phrased it, "to the little gentleman in a velvet jacket."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the middle of a residential neighborhood in Pune stands an ancient temple with a huge tree growing all around the structure. The tree has beautifully encapsulated the entire structure and is now a part of the temple.

This temple is called Zakoba Temple, with the name “Zakoba” referring to the temple’s deity. An equestrian idol of the deity is enshrined within the “Gabhara” (the sacred inner chamber of the temple). The entrance of the temple has two stone pillars. On either side of the entrance, there are two “Virgals” (Victory Stones/Hero Stones) depicting warriors. Within and around the temple there are idols and photos of other deities also.

The temple is painted in shades of yellow and red. The peepal tree (Ficus religiosa) surrounding the structure is most fascinating. The tree has made its way along the temple’s ancient stonework over the centuries and it now hugs the temple affectionately. It is beautiful to admire nature’s artwork in the way the tree’s branches and roots weave themselves through the stonework, creating a stunning display of the union of natural elements.

According to sources, some people believe this temple to be around 200-300 years old, considering its style of architecture and fascinating intricacies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2003, visitors to the Nashville Farmers’ Market have been lining up for platters of curry goat, jerk chicken, and braised oxtail. Dishes at Jamaicaway come in generous portions with spice levels that range from “mild” to the habanero-heavy “FIYAH.” Everything from the ackee and saltfish—the national dish of Jamaica—to the curry chicken–stuffed roti is made from scratch. 

In many ways, the restaurant feels akin to Nashville’s iconic meat-and-threes—cafeteria-style dining establishments that have been central to the city’s dining scene since the 1920s—albeit one where Southern sides like mac ‘n’ cheese, collard greens, and cheesy mashed potatoes share plate-space with Caribbean favorites such as plantains, breadfruit, and bammy. The stellar dessert menu is equally culturally split, with slabs of Southern–style frosted layer cakes and Jamaican treats like coconut milk–soaked sweet potato pone.

Owners Ouida and Dave Bradshaw now have something of a small restaurant empire in Nashville. Jamaicaway, a play on both the couple's home country and a parkway in Boston, where they previously lived, now has three branches around town. “[Ouida] has a very gifted hand,” Dave says. “Food has always been in her DNA.”

By the age of 10, Ouida was already helping her mother in the kitchen. While working as an elementary school teacher in Boston, her homemade treats quickly developed a fanbase among her students. “She’d tell them if they did well on a test, she’d cook them a meal,” Dave says.

The couple's son, Kamal Kalokah, who decided to go to culinary school after working at the family business, went on to become Rihanna's personal chef and tour with Drake. He and his brother, Rashean Conaway, currently run Riddim n Spice, a popular Caribbean restaurant in North Nashville. 

Nowadays, you don’t have to ace a test in order to try Ouida’s cooking. Swing by Monday through Friday for a curried goat plate and a slice of the ultra-moist, boozy black cake as a sweet reward.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost 200 miles north of Sweden, in the small city of Hudiksvall, Glada Hudik-teatern, the Happy Hudik Theater, gives people with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to participate in professional theater productions. Numerous plays and musicals, some of them televised, have been staged to showcase the talents and skills of the performers.

Bosse Östlin, who was born with an intellectual impairment, joined the ensemble in 1996 and toured theatrical venues in Sweden and abroad for several years. He played the Tin Man in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Despite his character not having a heart, Östlin was well-known for his huge heart. The actor loved hugs and would ask anyone, anytime, and anywhere for an embrace. In fact, in 2013, he even starred in a Swedish drama-comedy movie How Many Hugs Are There In The World?.

In 2015, Östlin died at the age of 63 of a brain hemorrhage. The following year, at the initiative of Glada Hudik-teatern, a life-sized bronze statue honoring the late performer was erected in Hudiksvall, his hometown. Sculptor Hanna Beling created the bronze, which was financed through auctions and crowdfunding. The statue is one of the first in Sweden to depict a person with an intellectual disability.

To honor Östlin's love of hugs, the bronze is filled with heating coils and maintains a normal human body temperature all year round, encouraging passersby to stop and give the statue an embrace. Östlin often said, "If I get a hug, I'll be in a happy mood!" And today the warm likeness is a poignant memorial to the beloved actor's catchphrase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, St. Martin's Theatre doesn't seem that special. From the outside, it's just another building in the West End of London with colorful neon lights starkly contrasting on an all-white Victorian facade. Walk 100 feet in any direction and you're sure to find more neon-lit, Victorian theaters. But what makes St. Martin's special isn't the building itself, but the production that takes place each night, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap.

For nearly 50 years, St. Martin's has continuously run the same play every day of the week besides Sundays. The theater has been so closely linked to the play that most of the decor in its foyer is centered around the show. There are plaques and awards hung on the walls for the show's record-breaking run. A giant wooden counter in the theater's entrance lets theater-goers know what performance number they are attending. Despite the fact that seeing show 29,160 will be the exact same as show 29,159, there is a sense of pride knowing that you played a small part in extending the streak.

The play itself is fantastic; there is a reason why it's still running to this day after debuting over 70 years ago in 1952 (and moving to St. Martin's in 1974). The "Queen of Crime," Agatha Christie, switches up her usual medium of novels to tell a captivating murder mystery tale for the stage all while retaining the same themes and motifs that make her books extraordinary. And since it is a murder mystery play with a few dramatic reveals, that is all I can give away! Do yourself a favor and book tickets to solve the murder and see the world's longest-running theater show!]]></summary>

Resourceful members of the congregation went 'rock picking' and scoured the surrounding area for chunks of volcanic stone. This true community effort has a place of honor on the National Register of Historic Places.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[St. Peter's Rock Grotto is a beautiful, idyllic spot located in the tiny village of Farmer, South Dakota (Population: 15). It was constructed between 1926 and 1933. The grotto was built by Fr. Peter N. Scheier using natural materials, often ones he purchased on trips to the Black Hills.  

The Grotto was once surrounded by a Roman Catholic elementary school, but that institution closed in 1959. The Grotto underwent a formal restoration in 2001, and at that time it was inducted into the National Register of Historic Places.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The old exchange building Bukit Nanas is located at the intersection of Jalan Gereja and Jalan Raja Chulan. The building was built in 1928 as the Central Battery Telephone Exchange by the British during their colonization of Malaysia. The site was ideally suited as it provided important links to Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding environment. It was subsequently upgraded from manual to mechanical in 1938.

During World War II, the building was targeted by the Japanese before their occupation of Malaysia. Afterward, the British return was short-lived and the building was taken over by Telekom Malaysia following independence.

With the inception of International Direct Dialing from Malaysia, the requirement for switchboard-operated communications ended including the use of the building. However, in 1985, the prime minister at the time saved the building from demolition.

The Telecommunication Museum was the first of its kind in Malaysia to have interactive exhibits. The museum is a repository of old telephones and outdated machinery once used for telecommunication. It houses several audio-visual exhibits, educative rooms for school kids archives, and resource areas with some artifacts over 120 years old and going back to the prewar era. Apart from an array of very stylish phones, there is even a telephone book that includes popular advertisements from the 1960s.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blink and you might miss the entrance to this 40-meter-long cave, where you can spot fossilized shells embedded in walls. About 3 million years ago, the cave and steep canyon walls were carved out by ocean waves, although the green lushness that awaits at the end of the tunnel these days feels more like a scene out of Jurassic Park than an underwater seascape.

The steep canyon walls create a valley full of hairpin turns that open up at the other end of the cave. They are completely covered with a thick layer of tropical ferns. The temperature here remains around 20 degrees Celsius all year, making it not only a cool escape from Kochi's balmy summers, but also the perfect spot for over 40 species of fern to thrive. The sheer quantity and diversity of the plant life were recognized as a National Natural Monument in 1915.

The 30-minute walk along the little river that runs along the bottom of the canyon and over the rustic little bridge,  with sunbeams breaking through to illuminate the bright green, curly ferns, along with the total quiet, make the Ioki Cave feel like a sacred space, and are reminiscent of scenes from Ghibli movies. There are three waterfalls, with the largest tucked away at the end of the trail, the water collecting in a green-blue pool basin.

Unlike many Japanese natural beauty spots, which are often depressingly paved with concrete to make walking paths, the adjustments here are minimal. Be sure to bring sturdy shoes (or borrow some rain boots from the nearby visitor's center) to protect your feet from the damp and the occasional snake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The approach to the Golden Gate is one of the most hazardous sea routes in the world. It is narrow with swift currents, is flanked by numerous partly submerged rocks, and is often the site of dense fog. It furthermore is heavily trafficked. Even with today's navigational aids such as radio, GPS, and radar it can be perilous.

In the days of sail and steam it was much more so, as shown by the occurrence of many shipwrecks. These dangers motivated the construction of this lighthouse on the north side of the passage in 1855. The original location proved to be too high, such that the light was often obscured by fog, and so the lighthouse was moved to its present site in 1877. The light was first fueled by whale oil, then by kerosene, and then by oil vapor. Since 1927, the light has been an electric incandescent lamp. Though all these changes, the original Fresnel lens, made in the 1850s, has remained in use.

The lighthouse also included a foghorn and a building housing a steam boiler, built in 1903, still exists below the lighthouse proper, although it is usually closed to the public. The foghorn was basically a steam whistle like those on locomotives. A foghorn still exists, but it is now electric.

The light was finally automated in 1981, the last on the United States west coast, and the lighthouse keeper's cottage was torn down.

Although the light still actively operates under the management of the US Coast Guard, the rest of the structure is accessible as a historic site managed by the National Park Service, with scheduled open times when docents are available for talks and to take questions.]]></summary>

The mill processed corn and wheat for local farmers, and was one of the first in the area to process cottonseed, peanut, and castor bean oil. It was in operation until 1896 when the mill finally shut down operations due to the addition of larger, more efficient mills in the area. 

Today, the ruins of the mill are visible along the Briar Creek greenway on the edge of the Myers Park High School campus. The ruins can be freely explored and the site includes an informational sign about the mill’s history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dodie Smith, the author of the beloved children's book 101 Dalmatians, lived near the Suffolk town of Sudbury for more than 60 years. She frequented the town for shopping and banking, and was a recognizable presence in the community. It may come as no surprise then that Sudbury features in her classic book. One notable scene from the story features the town’s St Peter's Church. The church, or more specifically, the water fountain outside it, serves as the spot where Pongo and Missis rested while searching for their lost puppies.

"They had hoped they might meet some dog and hear if any news of the puppies had come at the Twilight Barking, but not so much as a cat was stirring. While they were drinking at the fountain, church clocks began to strike midnight.”

Today, visitors can still see this fountain where the two dogs took their break, though water no longer flows. Additionally, for those with a keen eye, a red bollard adorned with the bronze likeness of Pongo can be spotted across the street. This bollard is just one of the 14 in Sudbury's Talbot Trail, each bollard depicting a unique character or event from the town's rich history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On visiting Bristol Well, visitors will be struck by what looks like terraces of obsidian near some of the ruins. The terraces are indeed made of black glass and look similar to obsidian, but they are decidedly not of natural origin. They are slag, the waste product from smelting metal from ore.

A smelter was built at Bristol Well in the 1870s to process silver-lead ores from the Bristol Mine in the eponymous mountains about four miles east. The availability of water for processing, indicated by the "Well" in the name, was evidently a factor in this location.  A mill was built in 1880, and a new copper smelter was constructed around 1890, when the population may have been around 400. It didn't last however, the smelter was inactive by 1893, after which only small-scale activity took place. Bristol Well has been deserted since the early 20th century.

Besides the slag terraces, a couple of partly unroofed stone buildings remain as well as the mill foundation. Of particular interest are three beehive kilns at the south edge of the site. These are ovens for making the charcoal used in the smelting. Their workmanship is not as good as many other preserved 19th-century kilns, and a couple have partly collapsed.]]></summary>

Tenerife’s interior highlands are a moonscape, while its coastline of lava rock and sheer cliffs is pounded by surf.

The prestigious football team competes in the Premier League, the highest echelon of English football. This has not always been the case however, and in 2023 the club restored a piece of its history that shines a light on Spurs’ humble beginnings.

Legend has it that a group of schoolboys, Robert "Bobby" Buckle, Hamilton Casey, and John Anderson, huddled under a gaslit lamppost on Tottenham High Road one evening in 1882. Having played cricket at the Hotspurs Cricket Club, the boys, aged 13 and 14, pondered how to while away their time during the impending cricket off-season over winter. After some consideration, they decided that football would be the best solution. Their plans were soon put into action when Ca…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-07T19:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[White Pocket is a unique and visually stunning geological formation located in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in northern Arizona. It is situated within the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, a protected area known for its rugged beauty and remarkable rock formations. The closest developed town is Page, Arizona, about an hour east of the trailhead.

White Pocket is characterized by its swirling and intricate patterns of white and red Navajo sandstone, which have been sculpted over millions of years by the forces of wind and water erosion. The result is a mesmerizing landscape that resembles a frozen wave or a surreal painting. The rock formations at White Pocket often feature delicate, contorted layers, creating an otherworldly and dreamlike atmosphere.

Due to its remote location, White Pocket sees fewer visitors compared to other famous landmarks in Arizona like the Grand Canyon or Antelope Canyon. This relative seclusion adds to the appeal for those seeking a quieter and more intimate outdoor experience. 

Photographers and nature enthusiasts are particularly drawn to White Pocket for its unique and photogenic landscapes. The intricate patterns, textures, and vibrant colors of the sandstone formations provide endless opportunities for creative compositions. It is also a popular destination for hikers and backpackers who enjoy exploring the wilderness and the surrounding area. 

Access to White Pocket is challenging, as it is located in a remote and rugged area. The journey typically requires a four-wheel-drive vehicle and navigation skills, as the roads are unpaved and can be rough. Visitors are advised to come prepared with plenty of water, food, and fuel, as there are no facilities or services available.

It is highly recommended that visitors plan their trip in advance and check the official website of the Bureau of Land Management for up-to-date information.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Mayan language, Ka' Kutzal, the name of this cenote, means "rebirth" or "back to life." An appropriate name considering its history. The only Costco store in the city of Mérida (as of early 2023) sits between what is known as the city's Industrial Zone and a residential neighborhood called Cordemex. Both of these are related to the past of the site, as a factory once stood here that manufactured fibers out of the henequén (sisal) plant, a mainstay of Yucatan's industry. The factory was owned by the Cordemex company, the world's largest sisal products manufacturer.

When the factory was demolished and its floor removed, beneath a 15-centimeter layer of cement, a surprising find awaited and this natural sinkhole was rediscovered. Formed from the collapse of an underground cave, likely thousands of years ago, above a freshwater reservoir which was then exposed to the open, this cenote extends underwater in several directions into caverns and tunnels for tens of meters.

The "Costco cenote," as the sinkhole is also known, had a garden built surrounding it in its small "island" in the middle of the asphalted parking lot. Considering that the Cordemex factory closed in 1991 and Costco's store wasn't opened until 2015, Ka' Kutzal's rediscovery has certainly made it worthy of the "returned to life" name.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Skyscrapers are so common nowadays that it is hard to imagine a time when they were new and trendy. But a century ago, this was very much the case. As a product of industrialization, these types of buildings became popular all over the world. As with all new things, there was skepticism and a pioneer was needed to help people get used to the idea. The Swedish architect Sven Wallander was such a man, introducing Europe to its first skyscraper. 

While certainly a forward-thinking man, Wallander was by no means quick. Skyscrapers were an American invention, with the first one being built in Chicago in 1885, and many more following behind it. But the first kungtorn was not built until 1924. The second followed soon after, and was completed in 1925.

The first tower is based on the older style of Manhattan skyscrapers in the early 1920s, many elements of which can be spotted in the design of the tower. In fact, Wallander made a study trip to the island to get inspiration for the first ever skyscraper in Europe.  

The second tower was designed by Ivar Callmander, who went for a more Art Nouveau style. Both towers had 17 floors and stood 60 meters high, although Callmander added one meter to his tower to have the tallest skyscraper in Europe. The two towers became immediate icons for the city and drew many tourists. It was not long after this that skyscrapers started being built in the rest of the continent.]]></summary>

How a Secret Convoy Evacuated Ukraine’s Iconic Art

by Benjamin Dodman, France24

The Byzantine icons that went on display this month at the Louvre in Paris were evacuated from one of Kyiv’s most prestigious art galleries, the Bohdan and Varvara Khanenko Museum, in mid-May under military guard, as part of an ongoing effort to preserve the country’s cultural artifacts from Russian attack. “They’re not just Ukrainian treasures or Byzantine heritage,” said a curator from the Khanenko Museum. “They are hugely important to world…]]></summary>

To the north, the shallows of the Palk Bay eventually become the Bay of Bengal. To the south, the Gulf of Mannar is the antechamber of the Indian Ocean. Formerly fertile fishing grounds, both bodies of water are now hotbeds of a relatively recent kind of marine-based misdeed: sea cucumber crime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long before he wrote famous poems including "O Captain! My Captain!" and "Song of Myself,"  Walt Whitman was born on May 31, 1819, in a farmhouse in Huntington, Long Island.

The house was constructed by his father, who added several architectural quirks that distinguish it from others of its time—including a staircase built with every step of a different height and a penny embedded in the banister. Whitman, who was the second of nine children, lived here with his parents, older brother, and younger sister (grandma stayed over too on occasion) for the first four years of his life, before moving to Brooklyn in 1823.

It was in his birthplace, where his family kept a farm, that he developed his love of nature and admiration for the virtues of day-to-day labor. After Whitman's family moved out, the house passed through various tenants—some of whom respected its storied origins more than others.

In 1949, it was nearly sold for development before intervention from the newly founded Walt Whitman Birthplace Association, which ran a campaign across Long Island to buy the property. Nowadays, the birthplace is a museum managed by the Association and New York State.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many of us, summer conjures a patchwork quilt of memories set against blue skies and a bright, sweltering sun. Perhaps you remember trekking as a kid through a real-world version of Jurassic Park, such as Kentucky’s Dinosaur World, or venturing to a remote observatory, like the famed Tatacoa Astronomia in Villavieja, Colombia. Or maybe you remember family RV trips through America’s national parks, or stumbling across a beach covered in sea glass in Hawai‘i. Whatever summer memories come to mind, one thing’s for sure—we all remember warm July days spent exploring the unknown.

In these four episodes of the Atlas Obscura Podcast, host Dylan Thuras asked listeners to share their most magical summer memories. From becoming vegetarian after eating at a northern Michigan restaurant filled with taxidermied animals to walking from London to Rome following in the steps of a medieval archbishop, listen to some of the delightful stories listeners shared with us.

Magical Summer Memories Vol. 1



Hear about encounters with wild bears in Michigan, filling water jugs at Mississippi’s fountain of youth, and one couple’s journey to a remote Bulgarian village to try Cherni Vit Green Cheese.

Magical Summer Memories Vol. 2



Hear about one man’s trek from St Paul’s Cathedral in London to St Peter’s Cathedral in Rome, recreating the route of the 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury, Sigeric. The 110-day journey followed the Via Francigena, an ancient pilgrimage way that Sigeric traveled more than a thousand years ago.

Magical Summer Memories Vol. 3 - The Cardiff Giant



Hear a listener’s tale of a theological dispute that became a real moneymaker known to some as “Old Hoaxy.” It all started in October 1869 when workers discovered a gigantic, 10-foot-tall stone man dubbed the Cardiff Giant in New York State.

Magical Summer Memories Vol. 4 - The Magic of Water



In this final installment of summer stories, we tackle a topic that transcends the seasons—the captivating magic of water during travel.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This stucco and stone exterior feels visually out of place with its colonial surroundings in Panama City's historic Casco Viejo neighborhood. The reason for this is that the church is actually from the much older city of Panama Viejo, and was transported from its ruins. 
Located 12 kilometers away from Panama's historic city center, Panama Viejo is the oldest city established by European settlers in North America, dating back to 1519. Panama Viejo was destroyed in 1671 during an attack led by the Welsh privateer Henry Morgan. The population elected to move to the peninsula—the site of the present-day Casco Viejo—to be better fortified from attack.

La Iglesia de la Merced was built in the early 1600s by Franciscan monks. They transported the church brick-by-brick to the new location (until they ran out of funds) and completed the project with wood. The first mass was offered on the day of Panama City's inauguration in 1673.

Unlike other colonial churches, the interior is upheld by a wooden ceiling and the mixture of surfaces is an architectural delight. Additionally, the site is known for its mosaic work, which lines the address along the sidewalk. This dates back to 1732.

The church also boasts the statue of 13th-century saint Maria de la Cervello. After she had died, she would sail on the wings of the wind to rescue ships who were at risk of shipwreck.]]></summary>

Although Whitman only lived in the house where was he born for the first four years of his life, he frequently returned to the area, where his family had roots for more than a century.

On his visits, he enjoyed wandering the grounds of what is now the park, climbing up to what is the highest peak on Long Island—at a whopping 400 feet in elevation. (Hey, nobody said Long Island was known for its hills.)

Nowadays, the top is marked by a sturdy rock emblazoned with Whitman's poem, "Paumanok," the Algonquian name for Long Island. At its base, you can also usually find an assortment of smaller painted rocks left by fellow travelers on the trail.]]></summary>

The gallow hill was the main punishment site of Stockholm, dating back to sometime in the 17th century. (Before that there was another site.) It is about an hour's walk away from the city center and back in the day death row prisoners would walk from their cells to the hill. Once there they would get a last drink at a local bar and then it would be time. 

The gallows were disassembled after the death penalty was repealed but the site was never forgotten. It got renewed notoriety in the 1930s when the area was being developed for housing and skeletons were found in the area. 

The site was then declared a national monument and marked off with some stones. Unfortunately, there is nothing else there to see apart from the sign pointing you to the history of the area.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, in a bombed-out museum in La Plata, Argentina, I was offered yerba mate by a complete stranger. A winter chill whistled through the front wall left exposed by a tank, whilst a woman continued to warm water into her mate and offer it to those in the room. The hot burst of bitter liquid drew an invisible line connecting everyone in that gray, somber space.

Mate is a caffeinated, tea-like infusion made from the dried leaves of the yerba mate plant. Often drunk hot, mate has an intense, earthy taste—think grass, smoke, and soil. The practice of drinking from a shared straw in ronda (in a circle) has been bringing people in Argentina together for centuries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gandantegchinlen, or Gandan as locals and visitors alike refer to it, was once one of the only permanent buildings in this city of tent-dwelling nomads. It served as the main Buddhist temple here until the communist era when religion was suppressed and most Buddhist temples in Mongolia were destroyed.

The monastery was originally established in the early 19th century outside of Khüree (now known as  Ulaanbaatar). Its name translates as ”the great place of complete joy.” The monastery complex is made up of a number of shrines, temples, and assembly halls.

Gandan was closed in 1939 during the anti-religious persecutions in Mongolia, and many of its buildings were razed. In 1944, the monastery was reopened, and for nearly 50 years it was the only active monastery in the country.

Since the 1990s, Gandan has been rehabilitated in stature and reopened to worshippers. After much recent renovation, it is worth visiting to experience the current role of Buddhism in Mongolia. The addition of the Batsagaan Grand Assembly Hall adjacent to the main temple adds to the grandeur of the complex.

Inside the main temple stands Avalokitesvara, the tallest indoor standing Buddha statue in the world at 26 meters (85 feet). Walk clockwise to see the hundreds of smaller statues that surround the temple interior.]]></summary>

But in Virginia, at the battle site of the Siege of Yorktown (1781), there is a grave of some 50 French soldiers who lost their lives in that fight that resulted in the independence of the United States.

Around 8,000 French soldiers joined the colonial soldiers fighting in Virginia, and along with 29 French warships, were able to lay siege to Cornwallis's British troops and force a victory. While the 50 French soldiers buried include those who fell during the siege attacks, this also includes many who died from malaria and other diseases.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Beatles is one of the biggest bands of all time and we are all familiar with their classic hits such as "She Loves You," "I Want To Hold Your Hand," and "Can't Buy Me Love."

Today, it's hard to imagine there was a time before the Fab Four were rich and famous. However, in 1960, the lads were still mediocre, unknown teen performers struggling to get gigs in their hometown of Liverpool. So when offered a residency at a small club in Hamburg's red light district, they decided to try their luck.

Life for the mop tops in the German port city was wild and crazy, but far from glamorous. They slept in cramped, smelly storerooms and had to play for hours and hours on end for peanuts. The long and grueling sets gave the young Liverpudlians the experience and the professional skills they needed though. When returning home to England in 1962, the beginner musicians had transformed into accomplished soon-to-be pop stars—or as John Lennon once famously said: "I might have been born in Liverpool, but I grew up in Hamburg"

Beatles-Platz opened in 2008 and celebrates the fact that Hamburg was the Fab Four's springboard to global stardom. The small square is shaped like a vinyl record with a diameter of 29 meters (95 feet). Famous Beatles song titles are engraved in the stonework and the place is adorned with life-sized, metal silhouettes (which almost look like giant cookie cutters) of the members.

The plaza is located at the crossroads of the Reeperbahn boulevard and the Grosse Freiheit side street in Hamburg's seedy St. Pauli area—just a few steps from the venues where John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr once got their start.]]></summary>

The train usually consists of two locomotives and a string of utilitarian passenger cars. But on this morning, two of the cars, directly behind the locomotives, disrupt that familiar conformity.

Unlike the regular Amtrak cars, these ones look just like they did decades ago: One is polished stainless steel and the other a rich brown and orange with yellow stripes. The passenger cars, named “Blue Ridge Club” and “Pacific Home,” were built decades before the others, in an era when rail cars still got names instead of numbers. They are among a few dozen privately owned vintage cars that still ply the rails, offering …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situated in the heart of Australia's Pilbara region at the mouth of the Harding River is the small historic town of Cossack. This once-abandoned area is steeped in history and in recent years the town's buildings have been restored to allow visitors to step back in time. The history first started with the Ngarluma people, the local Aboriginal people who occupied the land for hunting and fishing for thousands of years.

In 1863, a British-born Australian pioneer named Walter Padbury landed his ship, Tien Tsin, near Cossack. Over the next few eyars, many others followed to settle was the first port in northern West Australia. The area was initially used for pastoral farming which led to the development of infrastructure.

Cossack was one of the key sites for the booming pearling industry across the region in the 1800s. Historic records indicate that in the early 1870s, there were up to 80 pear luggers operating in the region. This led to an influx of Japanese, Chinese, and Malay people who migrated to work in the arduous conditions of the industry.

The following years saw many workers and ships involved in pearling move to Broome and alongside the decline of the gold rush, this led to the population of Cossack rapidly declining. In the 1940s, the last residents left, leaving the stone buildings to fall into a state of disrepair.

In 2007, a decision was made to restore the buildings to their former glory, and the town is now a designated museum town. Visitors can walk around and venture inside the restored structures, including the bakehouse, the courthouse, and the historic post office.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pi is an irrational number with an infinite amount of decimals. While 3.14 is good enough for high school students and most engineers often use 4.0 just to be sure, there are actually a lot of uses for the rest of the decimals, primarily in cryptography. These days we know pi down to tens of trillions of decimals, but not too long ago calculating a few dozen could literally take a lifetime. 

Many people in history spent years of their lives calculating a few decimals of pi, using a method where a circle can be approximated by a many-sided polygon that can have millions of sides, becoming closer to closer to a circle. The last person to use this method is the 16th-century mathematician Ludulph van Ceulen who spent 25 years working on the problem, coming up with a polygon that had 0.5 billion sides and calculating its circumference to calculate pi to within 20 decimals and later expanding to 35.

This number was considered his life's work and gave him great renown, especially because this level of detail was more than enough for any practical use. The number is also dubbed the Ludolphine number in his honor. 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288

Not long after this, in 1666, Isaac Newton found a new method of calculating pi that can be done in arbitrary precision, making the old method that Van Ceulen used obsolete. Fortunately, he did not live to see this.

After his death in 1610, this number was placed on his grave in the Pieterskerk in Leiden. The gravestone was lost over the years but restored in 2000. The monument can still be seen today, bearing the following roughly translated text: "Here lies buried Mr. Ludolph van Ceulen, professor in mathematics. Born on the 28th of January 1540, died on the 31st of December 1610. During his life, with lots of effort, he found that with a diameter of 1, the circumference is between 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288 and 3.14159265358979323846264338327950289"]]></summary>

The hostel, now in a dilapidated state, was built in 1958 to accommodate the increasing number of students from Brunei that were sent for schooling abroad. This was common in the 1950s as Brunei was facing economic struggles and difficulties in setting up its own former education system. Initially, only students from the Islamic stream were sent to Singapore, but later, English and Malay stream students also joined.

“This was my first time playing the typewriter as a musical instrument, but hopefully not the last,” says poet Monica Thomas, who provided backup to Renee Bebeau’s percussion while typing a local news story on a vintage Remington, made in—you guessed it—1913. “I heard there’s a group in Madison organizing a typewriter orchestra, so there’s hope for next year.”

Spring water running off the hillside flows by gravity through the gargoyle’s mouth and is used to refresh many horses that took the time to stop and take a drink. Standing outside of what is now the Black Rock Brewpub, the gargoyle fountain still watches as many people pass by in automobiles.

Standing at nine feet tall, this work of art was restored by the Schuylkill County Municipal Authority in memory of local educator Howard S. Fernsler, according to the base of the fountain. The fountain was restored in 2020, but does not appear to be working at the moment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main building of the University of Pune (now Savitribai Phule Pune University) used to be, once upon a time, the monsoon residence of the Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) during the British era.

Due to the weather conditions, Mumbai used to be the winter residence, Pune was the monsoon residence and Mahabaleshwar was the summer residence. The Governor, while shifting from Mumbai to Pune for the monsoon, used to bring along the entire entourage which consisted of staff, furniture, utensils, food, and other paraphernalia. 

A short distance away from the main building (which was the Governor’s Bungalow), was the kitchen. Today, the building where the kitchen used to be, is called Potdar Sankul. 

From the kitchen to the main building, there exists an underground tunnel. This 300-foot-long tunnel was used by the staff and servants to transport food from the kitchen to the dining room in the main building.

Along the length of the tunnel run pipes for hot water and cold water. At the end of the tunnel is a wooden staircase that goes up into the main building. At the base of the stairs is a pantry, where expensive cutlery was kept. Next to the pantry, under the stairs, is a room where the butler used to sleep. Along the tunnel’s ceiling, at regular intervals, are openings for ventilation. 

The main building was built between 1864 to 1871 and the tunnel was built during the same period. The tunnel was nonoperational for many years. Recently, it has been refurbished, whitewashed, and lit with retro-style lightbulbs. 

The tunnel is accessible to the public by means of a guided heritage walk conducted by the university authorities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1958, the artist B.C. Binning was commissioned by the Imperial Bank of Commerce to create a tile mosaic mural for the lobby of a new office tower on the corner of Granville and Dunsmuir in Vancouver.

The lobby has now been incorporated into a modern drug store, but thankfully the mural was saved. Take the stairs to the second floor of the store and you will come face to face with a spectacular tile mosaic that portrays Vancouver's booming resource economy at the time.

Binning was one of Canada's foremost modern artists and architectural innovators. His brightly-colored, semi-abstract paintings and sculptures were influenced by artists like Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. This mosaic mural is made up of more than 200,000 pieces of Venetian glass, covering an enormous wall.

Eve Lazarus, author of Vancouver Exposed: Searching for the City’s Hidden History,  provides an excellent overview of the history of the mural and a visual key to help interpret the different sections.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the early 1910s, the Pittsburgh Limestone Company built its workers homes in lieu of creating a union. Since they took the deal, they were labeled as "Yellow Dogs" by pro-union workers. Rather than chafe at the idea, the workers decided to adopt the name and called the town Yellow Dog Village.

When the mine shut down in the early 1950s, many workers left to find work elsewhere, but many people stayed as the mine was repurposed into the world's largest mushroom mine. The town remained habited until the early 2000s when people started to get sick. In 2012, the residents were forced to leave when E. coli was found in the drinking water.

It remained abandoned for a few years until a history teacher bought the property with plans of renovating the town into a living history museum. Unfortunately, those plans never came to fruition and the town was repurchased in mid-2022.

Today, while the village remains semi-abandoned, the new owners allow tours and host open houses for a small fee. They plan on renovating a few of the houses for overnight purposes, and are allowing guests to revisit the history of this special place so many once called home.]]></summary>

Sitting outside late at night, even after most people are asleep, provides a sense of togetherness like few other things I know. I have never been lonely in the darkness or afraid of the night; I have loved the stars too fondly, as the poem says. Each twinkling star is a sun setting on some distant planet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The history of this remote and uncrowded place is fascinating. The land knowns as the Great Dismal Swamp covers more than 2,000 square miles over parts of Virginia and North Carolina. It's the last remaining piece of a larger landscape that once spread across more than 1 million acres. It's home to large swaths of important plant and animal habitats. It's a National Wildlife Refuge, it's a North Carolina State Park, and it was part of the route for the Underground Railroad. Prior to the American Civil War, thousands of people who had escaped slavery made the Great Dismal Swamp their hidden fortress of freedom.

Known as "maroons," these freedom seekers made the swamp their home, if they weren't passing through to the northern states. Many of the maroons of the Great Dismal Swamp were enslaved people of African descent, but also among them were many Native Americans seeking escape from colonial expansion into their land. Some lived there for over 30 years, free from oppression.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubur Kassim graveyard dates back to the early 19th century and has served as a burial ground for generations of Muslims in Singapore. The cemetery has witnessed the interment of individuals from various backgrounds, including early settlers, pioneers, and notable figures from the Muslim community.

The graveyard is a serene and solemn place, marked by rows of simple gravestones adorned with traditional Islamic inscriptions. The vegetation is also very flourishing and wild there, with big trees all around.

However, it is worth noting that the Kubur Kassim Cemetery also carries intriguing legends and superstitions that have captured the imagination of many. Situated in the neighborhood of Siglap, which translates to "dark one" in Malay, the cemetery has acquired a reputation for mysterious occurrences. It is said that the area earned its name after a peculiar eclipse event that took place in 1821. These tales have contributed to the cemetery's allure and the prevalence of ghost stories and urban legends associated with it.

Legends persist of supernatural beings haunting the grounds, such as the Pocong and Pontianak. The cemetery's mystical ambiance supposedly even inspired the 1957 Malay film Pontianak, with some scenes shot in nearby areas.

What makes the Kubur Kassim Cemetery even more intriguing are the tales surrounding the Orang Bunian, mythological humanoid beings believed to dwell hidden from human sight. According to local lore, dedicated tombs honoring the Orang Bunian are said to exist within the cemetery, awaiting those with a keen eye and patient exploration.

These legends and stories add an extra layer of fascination to the historical and cultural significance of the Kubur Kassim graveyard. It continues to be a site where the past converges with myth, capturing the imagination and curiosity of those who venture into its hallowed grounds.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gregory Natural Bridge is a natural sandstone bridge in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that was covered by Lake Powell filling up since Glen Canyon Dam's completion in 1966. The 137-foot arch was last seen in 1969 but has recently resurfaced with declining lake levels.

Lake Powell hit its lowest water level in 2023 since being filled in 1980. The declining water levels have revealed other hidden treasures like Cathedral in the Desert.

The arch was formed by thousands of years of erosion. Erosion causes certain sections of the sandstone to become more vulnerable to weathering, while others remain relatively intact. As water seeps into cracks and freezes in cold climates, the rock expands and leads to the widening of gaps and fractures. Eventually, an arch-shaped opening is formed.]]></summary>

The word comes to us from the Old English twyelyghte, or half-light, when the vivid colors of the day fade to a shadow palette of grays. Of course, the colors don’t change, but our ability to discern them does. Most animal eyes have a mix of rods and cones, light-sensitive cells that provide information to the brain about either light (rods) or color (cones). The bespoke blend for each species depends on its particular niche in the ecosystem: Nocturnal animals, such as owls, have a significantly higher ratio of rods to cones in their retinas to mak…]]></summary>

But at a seemingly random intersection, you will find an old entry gate and a historical marker, which is all that remains of Majors Stadium.

Greenville is located about 50 miles northeast of Dallas. The stadium was home to high school football, followed by a minor league baseball team named the Majors starting in 1946. The stadium and the team were named after World War II hero Truett Majors.

In 1949, the team played an exhibition game against the New York Yankees and won 4-3. Playing in center field was Joe DiMaggio. Pitcher Monty Stratton played in this stadium in 1950 for the Majors. He was portrayed by Jimmy Stewart in the movie The Stratton Story.]]></summary>

According to one, those who climb to the top are said to be reborn into their new selves. It may also have been a place where Shugendō priests practiced their search for enlightenment.

Another legend is linked to Daidarabotchi, a mythological giant whose stories have been told across Japan since the eighth century. His alleged footprint can be found on the mountainside, believed to have been made when he urinated to create the Toyo River, one foot on Mount Ishimaki and the other on Mount Hongū, about 12.5 miles apart. There is a sign indicating the site, but it also explains that the "footprint" is actually a creation of erosion in a mass of limestone…]]></summary>

In 1990, the owners of what is now known as Butler’s Run were looking for a pet and found a puppy at the local Nashville Humane Society. They named the dog, who was believed to be a mix of a black Labrador retriever and a springer spaniel, Butler.

When they brought him to their building on 2nd Street, he quickly learned to love making his rounds about the downtown scene. He would get a snacks from local restaurants and visit shops and people along his travels. He also left his footprints in the concrete near the building leaving his indelible mark on the town. When Butler passed away in the fall of 1999, a statue was erected in his honor near his preserved footprints.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rochester, New York, is known for many things that make up part of its identity: Kodak, Genny beer, lilacs, and garbage plates are things that the Flower (or Flour) City takes pride in. An important chapter in the city’s history is related to the fight for women’s rights and the abolition of slavery in the 19th century.

The city was home to Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass, and their gravesites in Mount Hope Cemetery are the most frequented. It might seem surprising then, that the city which served as a station of the underground railroad also has some Confederate soldiers scattered around the area, too. Indeed, one of of these Graybacks rests in Fairfield Cemetery, in the village of Spencerport, located on the Erie Canal. 

Dewitt C. Guy’s final resting place is an inconspicuous small headstone in a family plot, which is marked by a larger stone. A small American flag decorates it, as well as a Southern Cross of Honor, and a small plaque noting his time as a prisoner of war at Point Lookout.

Rochester newspapers have featured information on Guy, and other Confederate soldiers, several times through the years, so finding further information on him is just a quick Google search away.]]></summary>

The bronze statue of one of the all-time boxing greats dots a scenic view of the waterfront.

The statue is of Easton’s most beloved resident and former heavyweight boxing champion, Larry Holmes. The street where the statue is located also happens to be named after the boxing great. The imposing statue was placed between Holmes Drive and the Lehigh River and across the street from two buildings that also bear the heavyweight champion’s namesake.

Holmes held the heavyweight championship from 1978 until 1985 with a career record of 69-6, which included a whopping 44 knockouts. He made 20 successful title defenses placing him third all-time. The statue was unveiled on December 13, 2015, with Holmes in attendance.]]></summary>

The tree was planted in 1932 to celebrate the bicentennial of George Washington's birth in 1732. It was part of a larger effort to celebrate the first president's birthday through trees, organized by the American Tree Association.  The organization distributed a book titled “George Washington Bi-Centennial Tree Planting” with instructions for planting successful memorial trees. It was a success, and a number of memorial tree-planting events were held all over the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twin Falls, on the Snake River a little over five miles upstream from the eponymous city (and about two and a half miles upstream from Shoshone Falls), consists of similar-sized falls in chutes on either side of a stubby basalt pillar. Hence the name was particularly appropriate.

In 1935, however, Idaho Power built a hydropower plant in the south channel, completely blocking it. Hydroelectric power and rural electrification were priorities at the time, and no doubt job creation during the height of the Great Depression was another primary motivation for the project. The powerplant is still in use, and after an upgrade in 1995, the plant capacity is just under 53 megawatts. Although the aesthetic loss is regrettable, the plant has provided clean and sustainable energy for almost a century.

The north channel is now effectively a spillway. A low, submerged arch dam (weir) completely crosses the north channel on the upstream side and provides an even level over which the current now falls.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In geology, a "water gap" is an active watercourse that crosses a mountain range. Water Gap is therefore not a misnomer, as it's where drainages from the Grant and Quinn Canyon Ranges to the west, in Garden Valley, converge to cross the Golden Gate Range. They flow out into a playa (dry lake bed) in Coal Valley.

Water Gap was the site of an improbable (and ephemeral) agricultural development project around the turn of the last century. The Cherry Creek Irrigation Company built a dam at Water Gap and platted a townsite, Oneota, with the idea that the stored water could irrigate crops. Unfortunately, the dam quickly washed out and the whole project had to be abandoned. Remains of the dam are said to be visible, but it's pretty much gone now. In fact, erosion has now incised a channel about 10 feet deep through the middle of the gap.

The area now lies completely within the Basin and Range National Monument, so anything that is left is protected. Please take only pictures and leave only footprints.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Livestock grazing was one of the founding economic activities in the development of the Western Frontier and remains important today. Sheep raising increased in importance by the beginning of the 20th century, and provided opportunities for Basque sheepherders who came to the West in substantial numbers. Hailing from the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain, these people, who speak a language unrelated to any other, were renowned for their expertise in sheep husbandry.

A sheep camp was established here by the Basques in the early 20th century, and in the early 1950s, the present structures were built. They include a bunkhouse, a storehouse, and a bread oven, the latter built as a separate free-standing masonry structure. Such ovens were common in the Basque community.

The site now lies within the Granite Chief Wilderness Area, which was designated in 1984, and the buildings were initially slated for demolition as inappropriate in the wilderness. Fortunately, the camp was then designated as a historic site, and the structures are now preserved on that basis. Indeed, they were restored in the early 2000s. Whiskey Creek Camp is now one of the handful of intact Basque sheep camps remaining.]]></summary>

The bridge was formed by continuous erosion from wind, water, and time, gradually shaping the rock into its current striking form. The formation is one of the largest natural bridges in the world. It spans an impressive 290 feet across and reaches a height of 275 feet.

Rainbow Bridge was designated as a National Monument in 1910 by President William Howard Taft, making it one of the earliest protected areas in the United States and is managed by the National Park Service.

Visitors can reach Rainbow Bridge by boat on Lake Powell. The journey provides scenic views of the surrounding red rock canyons and the vast expanse of the lake.

This may be strange as the Germans, nor the Soviets who controlled this part of Germany at the time had anything to do with the atomic bombs. However, just across the street from this location stands a house once home to President Truman for a short time. The memorial was built in 2005 under the leadership of the Hiroshima-Platz e.V. association led by Hideto Sotobayashi, an eye whiteness to the bombing.  

The piece was built under the purvey of the sculptor Makoto Fujiwara, who supervised the building of the monument by exchange students from the affected cities and local students. 

The text reads: "In memory of the victims of the atomic bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and August 9, 1945, During the Potsdam Conference of the Allied Great Powers from July 17 to August 2, 1945, the then President of the United States of America, Harry S.

The work was unveiled to the public in August 2017. The impressive structure sits at a height of 20 feet (six meters) and depicts several sea creatures and bird species that can be found on the Great Barrier Reef, including a life-sized stingray.

The artwork was completed with the help of six local Aboriginal artists from the Gimuy Walubara Yidinji people and the Yirrganydji people, who created stingray designs that appear sandblasted on the ground plane.

The area also has the advantage of an existing, well-developed transmission line infrastructure, due to the many large hydropower plants on the Columbia River system. For these reasons, the construction of wind-generating plants has boomed in the area over the last couple of decades.

The Wild Horse Wind Farm is an excellent example of one of these facilities, as it also includes a visitor center on renewable energy, many publicly available displays, and even guided tours. It is run by Puget Sound Energy, the utility for most of Washington.

The Wild Horse Wind Farm is located on Whiskey Dick Mountain northeast of Ellensburg. The first phase was completed in 2006, with an expansion following in 2009. It currently consists of 149 turbines, with a nameplate capacity of 273 megawatts. There is also a 500-kilowatt solar array, one of the largest in the state

Bornean orangutans are one of three orangutan species, all critically endangered. They thrive in carbon-rich peat swamp forests on the Indonesian island of Borneo. These habitats are also the sites of massive wildfires.

Indonesian wildfires in 2015 caused some of the worst fire-driven air pollution ever recorded. The fires were driven by an El Niño climatic cycle, which caused especially dry weather in the region.

Compared to other wildfires, peatland fires smolder underground and produce exceptionally high levels of hazardous gases and particulate matter—a leading cause of global pollution-related deaths and illnesses.

Edmaier's Secret is characterized by its intricate and vibrant sandstone patterns, sculpted over millions of years by the forces of erosion. The formations consist of layers of colorful sandstone with unique textures, shapes, and vibrant hues ranging from reds to oranges, yellows, and whites.

These striking patterns are the result of different mineral compositions and the deposition of sediment over time.]]></summary>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[RT by @ZoubinGhahrama1: Pale Blue Dot is a photo of Earth that was taken by the Voyager 1 space probe in 1990 from a distance of about 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles) as it was leaving our solar system. This is what Carl Sagan said about the photo:

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”]]></title>

What is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? 

One is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. 

Similarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct.
