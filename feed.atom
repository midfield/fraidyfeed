Thank you for the updated index.

Something similar pops up in Exercise 2.7.H on the following page, where in the problem statement of part (a) we should be showing that the stalk (i_*F)_q for q outside Z is the singleton, as opposed to showing that it is the empty set, I think? Lastly, for notational consistency the adjoint pair referenced in Exercise 2.7.F on p.93 might instead be (\alpha^{-1}, \alpha_*), as opposed to (\alpha^*, \alpha_*)?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behind Myrtle Beach International Airport lies an old Air Force base that has been repurposed into a small park and memorial. And if you’re at all interested in planes, military history, or the history of Myrtle Beach, it’s a must-see on any trip to the beach. 

Available to view here are three former Air Force planes: an A-7D Corsair, an A-10 Warthog, and an F-100 Super Sabre. All three are on “static display”, meaning you unfortunately can’t watch them get airborne, but you can walk around them in all their glory, admiring every wing and panel from close proximity. All three were fighter aircraft used by the Air Force when it had a base here, which closed in 1993. The park also includes a Wall of Service, which lists the names of military and civilian personnel who were stationed at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base until it closed in 1993. 

While you can’t watch these jets in action, Warbird park is an excellent place to watch commercial planes take off at the nearby airport once you’ve snapped a few photos of the Warthog (a type of jet flown since 1976) and the Super Sabre (designed in the 1940s). While the park is small, it offers some shade in the form of trees, as well as picnic tables where you can enjoy lunch as you catch a few landings. There are also some walking paths leading from the park.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[He may be the youngest person to ever walk on the moon, but that doesn’t mean that astronaut Charles Duke has his head in the stars when it comes to remembering his South Carolina roots. 

Although born in Charlotte, North Carolina, Duke’s family moved to South Carolina when he was around 10 or 11 and attended high school in Lancaster. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1957, Duke immediately became a 2nd Lieutenant in the Air Force and later earned a master’s in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT. In 1966 he applied to the Apollo program, and eventually became a part of NASA’s fifth group of astronauts. 

On April 20, 1972, Charles Duke took his first steps on the moon as part of the Apollo 16 mission. He was only 36-years-old, making him the youngest moon walker on earth. It’s a record that he still holds. Less than a year later, Duke also became the first inductee into the newly established South Carolina Hall of Fame, leaving his own moon boot footprints in cement in front of the Myrtle Beach Convention Center. 

“Moonprints” are easily recognizable by their wide soles and straight, thick ribs, and Duke’s look much like they did 50 years ago, thanks to mild weather and that they’re a bit off the beaten path. Along with the prints, there’s a plaque just beneath them reads: “These are the footprints of Astronaut Colonel Charles M. Duke, Jr., a native of South Carolina, who walked on the moon April 20, 1972, and the first inductee to the South Carolina Hall of Fame at its dedication on February 14, 1973.” 

Duke was the 10th out of 12 men to walk on the moon during the Apollo program’s six missions (which took place between July 1969 and December 1972), and spent 71 hours on its surface as a lunar module pilot of Apollo 16. While there, he collected a record 210 pounds of lunar rock samplings. 

Another fun fact: During that same mission, Duke left a photo of himself, his wife, and his two sons on the moon’s surface, and it’s still there today.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the late 1930s through the early ‘60s, Charlie’s Place was a prominent stop on the ‘Chitlin Circuit,’ an informal collection of Black-centered entertainment venues that included juke joints, clubs, and theaters. It was also the spot to be along Carver Street in Myrtle Beach’s Booker T. Washington neighborhood—a bastion of Black American history. 

Black entrepreneur Charlie Fitzgerald and his wife Sarah opened Charlie’s Place as a supper club in 1937, and it soon became a space for not only Black performers, but also for Black patrons to come and hear incredible music (often alongside whites) while temporarily escaping the oppressiveness of the era. Next door sat the Fitzgerald home and a small motel, The Fitzgerald, which the couple opened in 1948. The motel provided a place for bla…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current owner, Justin “Buz” Plyler, has been working at the Gay Dolphin Cove since he was eight years old. It is the family business after all. While some family empires are built on oil or manufacturing, the Plylers built theirs on souvenirs. The Gay Dolphin Cove isn’t just any souvenir shop, though, that would be like calling the Nile just a river. This nearly 80-year-old establishment bills itself as the nation’s largest gift shop, and at 35,000 square feet, with nearly 70,000 items (at least as of 2011), it would be hard to argue.

The shop first sprang to life in 1946 when Buz’s parents, Justin and Elise opened a little gift shop. They wanted a “whimsical nautical name” for the store, Plyler told the Sun-News in 2001. And the Gay Dolphin was born. Though Hurricane Hazel, a Category 4…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paul Cummings is a classic car guy— in every sense of the phrase. Not only is he the quintessential car collector, assembling his collection of American cars and trucks for over 50 years, but he’s also a collector of classic cars. And he has more than 150 of them. Each of these vintage beauties is a celebration of the car-making culture that built America. 

 

It started simply enough when Cummings’s father bought him a 1940 Ford. That gift spurred a lifelong love of cars. “Collecting cars has been my life’s passion,” Cummings told Myrtle Beach’s Sun News in 2009. Over the years, that passion revealed itself in a cadre of cars stored in “barns, chicken sheds, old warehouses and any other place he could find.” What this passion needed was a central location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even in the mini golf capital of the world, Mt. Atlanticus Minotaur Goff stands out, in part for its size. The two mini golf courses here offer a beautiful view of the Atlantic—hence the name, which conjures up a Mount Olympus on the shores of South Carolina. And indeed, you’ll feel like a god of leisure while hitting a colorful golf ball along the faux caves, islands, and fields here. The complex even includes a now-defunct department store, which has been retrofitted to feel like a mini golf grotto.

Mt. Atlanticus is a must-visit in the Myrtle Beach area, especially if you’re visiting with family or children. The courses include plenty of benches for waiting in case you’ve found yourself here on a warm summer night when the course is packed with golfers. 

You’ll also find a pond with koi fish, a bubbling pool labeled the “miraculous fountain of youth,” a waterfall, and plenty of (plastic) mystical creatures appearing from the water. (For the shopping-inclined, there’s also an extensively stocked gift shop.) Both courses have a bonus 19th hole, where a hole in one will win you free mini golf for life. But even if you can’t sink your final ball, you’ll have a blast here.]]></summary>

But while you should stop to look at the marker, you shouldn’t stop there—there’s a lot of history and culture to explore in Atlantic Beach. 

This town’s history dates back to 1934, when George Tyson, a local Black entrepreneur, bought 47 beachfront acres for $12,000, and formed the Atlantic Beach Company with 10 others, which became the town’s first governing body. Tyson soon opened the Black Hawk Night Club, and the area became a popular destination for Black tourists who were not able to visit other nearby beach towns thanks to segregation.

This natural alleyway of breathtaking live oak (Quercus virginiana) trees—planted in the 1700s—is part of a 9,127-acre natural and cultivated landscape that’s considered the “floral jewel of South Carolina’s coast,” and are considered a work of art in themselves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Monument to the Victims of the Sajmište Concentration Camp can be found on on the left bank of the river Sava.

The memorial is to honor the  Jewish women and children who were held at the Sajmište concentration camp from 1941 to 1942. During that period, some 10,000 Serbs, 7,000 Jews, and at least 60 Roma died at the concentration camp. The people who were imprisoned there were kept in squalid conditions in makeshift barracks. They were only provided with limited rations, with many victims starving and freezing to death during the winter of 1941–42.

The death camp was founded on the former trade fair grounds located near Zemun. It was operated by SS Einsatgruppen units stationed in Serbia. 

These victims of the Holocaust held in Sajmište Concentration Camp were murdered in gas vans during the spring of 1942. When the gassings were complete, the area was renamed as Zemun Concentration Camp. It then served to hold one last group of Jews arrested when Italy surrendered in September 1943.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On the night of January 29, 1893, in what is now downtown Curitiba, a young woman named Maria da Conceição Bueno was brutally murdered by her possessive lover, Ignácio José Diniz, a low-ranking soldier. Diniz slashed Bueno’s throat and stabbed her several times. News of the shocking crime spread throughout the city.

A cross was allegedly placed at the murder site. Soon after, legend has it that red roses sprung from the cross, nurtured by the blood of the murder’s victim. With this Maria Bueno’s reputation as a miracle worker was born. 

Maria Bueno didn’t become notorious until after her death. Little is known about her for a fact, but there is no shortage of narratives on who she was and how she lived. Most versions state that she worked as a laundress. By some accounts, she was a sex worker. By others, she was a formerly enslaved Black woman whose image has been whitened along the decades—depictions of her, including the life-size statue at her grave, usually show her as a white woman.

To her devotees, Bueno’s life story is not as important as the miracles she reputedly performs. Her grave is surrounded by a myriad of stone signs and metal plates brought by believers to thank the local martyr for her help in matters like getting a job or beating an illness. Flowers, ribbons, and figurines are among other tokens of devotion that can be found in the little chapel by the grave. 

For many locals, Maria Bueno holds the status of a saint. She is often referred to as Santinha de Curitiba (Curitiba’s Little Saint, or Dear Saint). So far, the Catholic Church hasn’t acknowledged her as such. In any case, the cult of Bueno is not exclusive to Catholics. She is also popular with followers of other faiths, especially Spiritualism and Umbanda, an Afro-Brazilian religion. Regardless of religious affiliations, though, Maria Bueno lives on in the collective imagination of the city as one of its most intriguing figures.]]></summary>

At first glance, the people mover at George Bush Intercontinental Airport known as the "Subway" doesn't look like much, nothing quite resemblant to a metro system one might expect in a city. But an avid fan of Disney World may notice its similarity to PeopleMover, an attraction in Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland, which the Subway shares much of its mechanical technology with.

The Subway first opened in 1969 along with the airport, but was replaced by a new underground train system that utilizes the WEDWay system, developed by what was then known as WED Transportation Systems, a division within the Walt Disney Company responsible for the design and construction of the rides at Disney parks. This should make the Subway a rare example of a Disney ride outside Disney parks, at least in spirit.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In November 1939, the Soviet Union attacked Finland along the border from the Arctic Sea to the Gulf of Finland. The assault began without a proper declaration of war—the Soviet Union seemingly hoped their invasion of Finland would be as easy as those in the nearby Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This was the start of the Winter War.

Although the Soviet Union forces greatly outnumbered them, the Finns actually successfully managed to repel the Soviet Union forces and then retained most of its territory when the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in 1940.

This sculpture stands in front of the army headquarters in Helsinki as a national memorial to the Winter War. It is the creation of Pekka Kauhanen, and has stood at Kasarmitori in Kaartinkaupunki since November 2017.  President Martti Ahtisaari unveiled the sculpture on the 78th anniversary of the Winter War.
The spherical base of the sculpture contains 105 photographs that highlight the events of the Winter War.  The visibility of the images, however, is not always what was initially imagined. Since the unveiling, it has been plagued by moisture, which condenses on the inside of the circular windows and impairs the visibility of the photographs inside.

The memorial is an expression of appreciation for the valuable input of veterans and everyone else who participated in the war efforts from the Finnish people. The memorial was designed to commemorate the more than 25,000 Finns who gave their lives for their country during the Winter War.]]></summary>

With millions of Americans out of pocket due to the Great Depression, board games were one of the cheapest forms of entertainment. One of the most popular games of the decade was Monopoly—no doubt precisely because it allowed players to imagine themselves getting rich and powerful.


Like Monopoly, but the Exact Opposite

One board game from the early 1930s was Monopoly’s diametrical opposite. Instead of celebrating capitalism, it aimed to destroy it. The players’ goal is to get rid of the rich and powerful, end oppression, and seize the means of production. Ultimately, their actions will turn the USA into the USSA—the United Soviet States of America.

The game was called Toward Soviet America. As you may have guessed by its absence from yo…]]></summary>

The World’s Last Internet Cafes

By Michael Zelenko, Jon Lubwama, Abhaya Raj Joshi, Sultan Quadri, Daniela Dib, Lucia Cholakian Herrera, and Viola Zhou, Rest of the World

The world’s first Internet cafe opened in London in 1994. Within a few years, they were everywhere, often providing customers with their first moment in the internet era. “The first day I entered, I didn’t believe it,” a university student in Accra recalled. “I didn’t believe it was Ghana.” Today, though, this communal space for exploring cyberspace has a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of 2023, Iceland is one of the few countries that still allows whaling—the hunting of whales (mainly) for food or oil. Fin whales and minke whales are the prime targets, the former for export and the latter for domestic consumption. In Iceland, public opinion on this practice is divided. The juxtaposition of commercial vs environmental motivations is further complicated by at least two other factors. On the one hand, the whale-watching industry is thriving, which obviously benefits from protecting whales. However, on the other hand, many Icelanders make a living in the herring fishing industry, which is adversely affected by large numbers of whales.

If opinion is divided in Iceland, there is no shortage of international organizations advocating a wholesale ban on whaling. Among them is the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which in 1986 orchestrated the sabotage of the whaling station in Hvalfjörður and sank two whaling vessels in the process, Hvalur 6 RE-376 and Hvalur 7 RE-377. Built in 1946, these two twin vessels had been in the Icelandic whaling fleet since 1961. A few days after the sinking, these vessels were recovered and towed to shore in Hvalfjörður, where they still are to this day.

Hvalfjörður translates as “whale fjord.” Traditional folklore maintains that early settlers spotted a pod of whales in these waters and named the fjord after it. A rival explanation is that the name originates from the presence of a large whale station (or more) in the fjord. To this day, Hvalfjörður is home to the only active whale station in Iceland.

The vessels, commonly referred to as the Beached Whalers, are safely anchored to the shore—side by side, as if they were the mirror image of each other. They are connected to heating and electricity, but damages caused by salt water and years of exposure to the elements were never repaired. Needless to say, they never went whale hunting again. Climbing on board is forbidden.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked away off the main road just west of Luwingu, Zambia, is a small waterfall called Lufubu Falls.   

A gently-flowing stream flows clear through some minor drops and tumbles before going around a gentle bend and then crashing over an immense stone structure before returning to its quiet flow. There have been a few structures built on the top, but they are mostly now in ruins. Teens will often gather here and sometimes churches will use the clear waters above the falls for baptisms, but rarely do outsiders visit this serene location.  

From the dirt parking area, you can hear the falls but due to heavy vegetation, you cannot see them. A short walk down some rock face will allow you a more clear view. The mist feels cool on a hot day and the mild roar is pleasant and peaceful.

Before she passed away, Elizabeth pointed her accusations at a local woman, Goody Garlick. Garlick was not well-liked by the townspeople, and soon after the accusation was made, the people would gather and speak of other evils potentially caused by the “witch.” 

Elizabeth’s father, Lion Gardiner, who was the first settler of the town and respected by all, determined Goody would be tried in Connecticut. This was done to attempt to ensure that Goody had a fair trial. The Connecticut court determined that Goody Garlick was not guilty of witchcraft. 

She returned to East Hampton, where she would live the remainder of her days as a free woman. The remains of Lion Gardiner and Goody Garlick are interred at South End Cemetery in East Hampton.]]></summary>

The story begins with Melvin “Tubby” Miller, who was born in Portis on May 6, 1900. After graduating high school, he changed his name to Melvin Millar, thinking it sounded more unique. Tubby Millar attended the Kansas City Art Institute, where he met and befriended Isadore “Friz” Freleng. Both students soon moved to Hollywood, attracted by a fellow Kansas City Art Institute graduate named Walt Disney. 

Freleng would get a job at Leon Schlesinger Productions, the studio behind popular shorts Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies. He rose to lead director, and created the character of Porky Pig. Porky Pig was an insta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, for our second photo contest of the year, we called out to all the night owls for their most memorable views after dark. At Atlas Obscura, we love reasons to stay up past our bedtimes and experience celestial moments that leave us in awe. We wanted to know: What do you see when the sun goes down?
We were dazzled by the beautiful nocturnal imagery our readers submitted. We saw landscapes gently reflecting moonlight, trails of stars etched into velvet skies, and dreamy views from windows. The most popular feature in the entries, by far, was the Milky Way in all its glory.
Behold our wonderful winning photos (view them up close with a click) selected by our staff—the first place winner is above. We hope they will inspire you to look up and around more often when darkness descends.
Congratulations to our winners, who scored some Atlas Obscura gear!

Its stone walls are painted white, its wooden floors are polished, and its banquettes are a dark gray that matches the tall, round columns supporting the room’s elegant cross-vault ceiling. The pillars and arched ceiling give the restaurant a distinctly religious atmosphere, but the original building—erected in 1858—was never frequented by churchgoers. It housed cows.

Rheinhessen’s history of intensive agriculture and viticulture stretches back to the ancient Roman era.

This large warehouse is the maintenance garage for the city’s historic M-Line trolleys. Inside is a seemingly scattered collection of woodworking benches, tool racks, and an assortment of giant and very heavy axles. When the Car Barn’s two enormous garage doors are open, the space reverberates with the loud hum of industrial fans and the high-pitched whirs of air pressure drills. Here in a former mattress warehouse, now a restoration and repair shop, is where Dallas’s newly acquired historic trolley cars are painstakingly restored and the current fleet is affectionately maintained.

In 2019, an international team of researchers mounted camera traps at two fresh elephant carcasses—what the authors call “carrion bonanzas”—in Tsavo East National Park. In their recent study in the journal Science Direct, they compare the death of an elephant in the park’s dry landscape to a whale fall (when a dead cetacean sinks to the bottom of the ocean), a feast that can support or even create a whole ecological community. Over a month of recording they saw the usual suspects of predators and scavengers take turns at the carcass th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, the only way to try Maria Piedad Cano’s famed arepas was to roam along Roosevelt Avenue well after dark and hope for good fortune. Cano was a lawyer and a judge in her homeland of Colombia, but after she fled to the United States, she turned to wielding a mobile griddle. In 1993, The New York Press dubbed her the “Saintly Arepa Lady” and the name stuck. 

Like many of New York City’s street vendors, Cano lived a precarious existence for decades. From 1983 through 2021, the city enforced a strict cap on the number of street vendor permits, leaving vendors struggling to either dodge the police or pay as much as $20,000 for permits on the black market. Cano was finally able to set up a brick-and-mortar location in Elmhurst in 2014, only to be forced to move once again when a developer demolished her building to make way for apartments. 

At long last, Cano was able to reopen in 2018, along with her son Alejandro Osorio, who runs the current iteration of the restaurant. Arepa Lady currently has three branches, but the Jackson Heights outpost feels closest to Cano’s roots. 

The arepas are as good as ever, particularly when crowned with a tangle of carne desmechada, slow-braised beef, or fat slices of chorizo. Order an arepa de queso, a plump corn cake oozing cheese from the interior, of an arepa de choclo, which comes folded over fillings like a diner-style omelet. Although carnivorous toppings dominate the menu, don’t sleep on the vegetarian offering—the trifecta of black beans, avocado, and sticky sweet plantains showered with grated cheese is outstanding.]]></summary>

The consistency is somewhere between a tomato soup and a curry gravy, with a pleasant, slow-building burn. It’s the perfect foil for the rich, slightly filling of goat meat—although these dumplings also come stuffed with paneer, potatoes, beef, and all manner of other fillings. 

With large Tibetan and Nepalese communities, Jackson Heights is the place to go for all sorts of regional styles of momos. By the time sibling duo Yamuna Shrestha and Shree Shrestha opened up their small restaurant in the shadow of the 7 train, the neighborhood already had a wealth of excellent options. Yet the Shresthas, who hail from just west of Kathmandu, still made a name for themselves, scoring the winning spot multiple years in a row on the informal neighborhood Momo Crawl. 

While an order of jhol momo belongs on every table, there are plenty of other heavy-hitters on the menu of Nepalese specialties. Both the thali and the samay baji sets offer solo diners the chance to try a range of dishes, all accompanied by chutney and brightly acidic pickles. Order one or two sel roti, chewy, crushed-rice doughnuts meant for dunking in a tangy, fiery dipping sauce, for the table. Head to the back of the restaurant to refill your cup with warmly spiced masala chai from the insulated container.]]></summary>

You can feel the history seep through the walls of this public house. The low, beamed ceilings, dark wooden furniture and stone hearth fireplace are cozy and inviting. At the same time, you can almost sense the ghosts of patrons past seated next to you as you sip ale out of a metal cup.  

Like so many pubs, The Lamb Inn offers the traditional Sunday roast of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, roasted veggies, and potatoes. But, Sunday Roast at The Lamb Inn is next level. This particular rendition of the classic is next-level, with generous portions and a heap of cheesy cauliflower included.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<div type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">What is multithreading? It is the use of multiple processors to perform tasks in parallel by a single computer program. I have known this simple fact for over thirty years, but funnily enough I never explored it in practice. The reason is fundamentally that I am a physicist, not a computer scientist, and as a physicist I tend to stick with a known skillset to solve my problems, and to invest time in more physics knowledge than software wizardry. You might well say I am not a good programmer altogether, although that would secretly cause me pain. I would answer that while it is certainly true that my programs are ugly and hard to read, they do what they are supposed to do, as proven by a certain record of scientific publications. <br/><p><a href="https://www.science20.com/tommaso_dorigo/multithreading_for_dummies-256741" target="_blank">read more</a></p></div></div>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From 1810 to 1823, Jean Lafitte and his brother Pierre were among the most notorious and successful privateers in the Americas. Like many great pirates, Jean Lafitte's exact origins are shrouded in mystery, but he is believed to be born either in France or one of its Caribbean colony Saint-Domingue (now called Haiti) and he had a spectacular reputation for drinking, womanizing, and debauchery.

An equal-opportunity spy and smuggler, Lafitte lent his skills in military endeavors from the War of 1812 to the Mexican War of Independence. At various points, he worked for the British, U.S., and Spanish armies. He supposedly died in 1823—an event many scholars later believed to be a ruse. 

In fact, according to local researchers in Lincolnton, North Carolina, believe that the buccaneer staged his own death, changed his name to Lorenzo Ferrer, then enjoyed a quiet life free from the prying eyes of law enforcement until his actual death in 1875. He is believed to be resting peacefully in the cemetery at St. Luke’s Episcopal Church.]]></summary>

The hot springs are a few hundred yards from the beach along a jungle stream. While you soak, you can make your own mud mask from the sulfurous clay by the river.

There are trails throughout the picturesque landscape of Tiské Stěny, which contains the towering sandstone rock formations. If you set out from the Church of Saint Anne (also known as Kostel sv.Anny), two trails lead up into the hills: one, a shorter jaunt to your left, and the other, a longer trail to your right. The shorter hike, despite its less daunting length, is still challenging, and unfortunately, neither trail is wheelchair-accessible.To access either hike, you need to purchase entry tickets…]]></summary>

The Good Friday Earthquake, as it’s sometimes called since it occurred two days before Easter, swiftly buckled the ground underneath, leaving a craggy, unrecognizable landscape. The neighborhood known as Turnagain Heights slid into the ocean, while some of the largest buildings in the city, including JC Penney, were demolished. Tsunamis that followed the 9.2-magnitude quake caused waves up to 20 stories high and wreaked havoc on the region.

But out of the rubble came a place of peace and perspective. Today, Earthquake Park in Anchorage is a serene…]]></summary>

A long time ago, when humans lived in large communal groups, following big game and taking shelter in caves, we weren’t sure what the stars were. But the stars mattered a great deal all the same. The earliest human art, painted on cave walls around the world, depicts both animals and objects in the sky, and often the seasonal connections between them.

We used the stars and the Moon to keep track of time, to track animal migrations and reproducti…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A sculpture of Dena’ina matriarch Olga Nicolai Ezi, known affectionately as “Grandma Olga,” stands proudly next to a bronze fish-drying rack in the Ship Creek Small Boat Harbor near downtown Anchorage.

Located along the banks of Ship Creek, a still-thriving urban salmon fishery, the bronze sculpture is part of a larger public art installation honoring this well-respected Dena’ina leader, her family, and their native customs. The Dena’ina were the original inhabitants of this south-central part of Alaska, and the only coastal Athabascan tribe. 

Small in stature, but highly influential, Olga Nicolai was born in 1875 in the Tyone Lake, Copper Center regions, where her father was a noted medicine man. In 1896, Olga married Simeon Ezi, one of the last chiefs of the upper Cook Inlet. 

Credited with much of the tribal lineage, the couple and their five children lived in the Native Village of Eklutna and took pride in the Indigenous customs—fishing in summer and hunting and trapping in the fall and winter. The family also operated a small boating business, shipping supplies from Anchorage to nearby villages. 

Dena’ina artist and University of Alaska Fairbanks graduate Joel Isaak sculpted the installation, called One’s Spirit, over roughly two and a half years. The artist spent months talking with Alaska Natives about their unique features and customs, which shows in his detailed metal work. Olga’s shoes, for example, would have been made of fish scales. The artist mimicked that unique texture in his work. The statue was officially unveiled in January 2019.

In all, the Grandma Olga section of the installation includes the elder, a fish trap and rack, and bronze salmon lying on the concrete. Plaques nearby detail her contributions and those of the Dena’ina people. The surrounding area’s stunning coastal views and scenery make it worth a visit, too.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On 26 acres of serene woodlands, six life-sized Native dwellings pepper the banks of Lake Tiulana on the campus of the Alaska Native Heritage Center. Opened in 1999, the center, which was built on Native Dena'ina Ełnena land, is located 7 miles east of downtown Anchorage and honors the lasting legacy of Alaska’s major culture groups.

Start the journey inside with an introductory film, “Stories Given, Stories Shared,” for a quick background on Alaska’s Native people. Then, watch as Native artists produce live works on a stroll through the Hall of Cultures. Vibrant wooden posts, moose-hide boots, bark baskets, seal-skin tunics, intricate beadwork, and other Native art fill the exhibit rooms. 

The Gathering Place serves as center stage for Native song and dance demonstrations, plus traditional games and storytelling. Outside, duck in and out of replica log cabins and underground cave-like structures that resemble ancient Native dwellings, and soak in the ways and customs of these close-knit, resilient communities. Culture bearers share stories and historic artifacts to help paint a picture of what life is and was like for Eyak, Yup’ik, and Athabascan peoples, among others. 

In April 2022, the center received over 1,700 additional artifacts, including baskets, ivory figurines, carvings, a qayaq, the coat of an Athabascan chief, and more from the Wells Fargo Alaska Heritage Library and Museum, a gift that nearly doubled the center’s existing collection.

One notable relic, a full-scale whale skeleton outside, illustrates the importance of the whaling industry to provide clothing, oil, tools, and sustenance to the northernmost coastal peoples.]]></summary>

In 1858, he graduated from the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts and shortly thereafter went to work for Danish architect Theophil Hansen. Hansen and his brother Christian Hansen were well established in Athens, Greece, having designed some of the capital’s most prominent landmarks. Between them, they designed Athens University, the National Library of Greece, the National Observatory of Athens, the National and Capodistrian University of Athens, the Academy of Athens, and several other significant buildings.

Theophilus invited Ziller to Athens in 1861 to supervise the building of the Academy of Athens. While doing so Ziller honed his eclectic architectural style and made many important connections which led to jobs supervising other Hansen…]]></summary>

Instead of continually teaching special case statistical tests, I prefer to teach general models that include tests as special cases. For the usual cross-sectional or longitudinal layouts this is quite standard. But for paired data, practitioners are not so used to seeing a model-based approach.
For paired data from a bivariate normal distribution, or for within-pair differences having a normal distribution, the paired -test is a standard procedure. BBR discussed how easy it is to get the same answer as the paired -test using either an ordinary linear model blocking on subject or using a mixed effects model with random intercepts for subjects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In her debut book, No Meat Required: The Cultural History & Culinary Future of Plant-Based Eating, Alicia Kennedy has written a manifesto—but, crucially, not a diatribe. More than half a century after Diet for a Small Planet—Frances Moore Lappé’s influential work on the need to reduce animal consumption—Kennedy makes a case for radically rethinking the place of meat in our warming world.

She has no intention of convincing all of her readers to go vegan or to adhere to the kind of moral puritanism with which the movement has often been wrongly associated. Instead, she takes an incisive look at the good, the bad, and the bizarre across the history of abstaining from meat, from religious sects to raw vegans, from toxic wellness culture to Silicon Valley–backed lab-grown meats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every summer, thousands of tourists flock to Wisconsin’s Door County peninsula. Businesses shuttered throughout the winter and spring reopen to sell food and souvenirs as people explore the county’s cherry orchards and state parks. At Northport, at the tip of the peninsula, ferries run between the mainland and Washington Island, crossing a channel French sailors nicknamed Porte des Morts or “Death’s Door” for the large number of shipwrecks swept up in the currents.

But right before arriving at Death’s Door, travelers are thrown for a curve—or fifteen to be more specific. An unusually twisty stretch of Highway 42, built in the early 1930s, has baffled visitors for decades. Who designed this surreal stretch of road?

This storied door in Westminster Abbey comprises five vertical oak planks held together with three horizontal battens and iron straps. Most unusually the battens are recessed into the planks so that the door is flush on both sides.  In 2005, the door was dated using a process known as dendrochronology. A study showed that the wood was felled after 1032 and the door itself was constructed sometime in the 1050s, during the reign of King Edward the Confessor.

For its age, this door inspires us to look as good as we grow on in years. Don’t be among those who come for the famous crypts and then miss the door.]]></summary>

On the bronze plaque at the rear of the statue is a curious circle of bees, all facing the queen in the center: the bees represent the state of Florence as an industrious community ruled by the grand duke. 

The plaque has acquired a local legend. Some say that it is impossible to count the number of bees using only your eyes. Because of the irregular concentric arrangement, those who try will always lose count—said to be a deliberate trick on the part of the grand duke and the sculptor, Pietro Tacca, who finished the statue started by his teacher, Giambologna. (There are a total of 91 bees depicted on the plaque.)]]></summary>

The statue was unveiled in 1992, 30 years after her death in 1962. It depicts Monroe sitting down with her legs crossed, with one of her iconic high-heeled shoes laying next to her. She is wearing a neat dress, and is staring over her shoulder. It was created by Nils Aas, a famous Norwegian sculptor, who also designed a few of the Norwegian krone coins.]]></summary>

Housed in a renovated warehouse, the unique cultural center is home to tens of thousands of used books, including such rarities as independent publications, antiquarian books, and donations from celebrities, as well as a large number of English-language books. All were collected from 25 indie bookshops around Seoul. The shelves are organized by the sellers, each of them maintaining its own cataloging system, cloning a smaller-scale version of it within the microcosm of the repository.

While its library-like selection of books is excellent on its own, not to mention photogenic with all the rainbows created by the colorful book spines, many of the visitors to the repository are after something else: Instagrammable photo opportunities.

And it's no wonder, really. Inside the repository, row after row of iron-framed bookshelf arches form a stunning tunnel. At the end of it is a mirror, creating a much bigger illusion, a dreamscape for bibliophiles. The unique bookshop has also made an appearance in several K-dramas.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A lot of people are saying that the indictments of Donald Trump have had the perverse effect of increasing his support among Republicans--for example, in the New York Times, Rich Lowry says "it’s not that he’s winning despite the indictments; it’s almost as though he’s winning because of the indictments."  The main piece of evidence is that his lead in the polls about the Republican nomination have increased since about the time he started getting indicted (the first was on March 30).   But is that because he's become more popular, or because his leading opponent--Ron DeSantis--has become less popular?  I looked for polls asking people if they had a favorable or unfavorable view of Ron DeSantis.  The figure shows percent favorable minus percent unfavorable for all of the surveys that are available:


It's hard to say what was happening through mid-2022, since three surveys taken within a few days of each other in July 2022 gave very different results.  However, if we start in September 2022, there's a clear pattern--first a rise until late 2022/early 2023, and then a decline.  The fact that the recent decline has been so steady suggests that it's not the result of any single factor.  Whatever the cause, it suggests that Trump's increasing lead may be because DeSantis is getting less popular, not because Trump is getting more popular.  

These results are all from general national samples, not samples of Republicans.  I would limit it to Republicans if I could, but the breakdowns aren't available for most of the surveys.  However, it's safe to say that very few Democrats have ever had favorable views of him, so that the changes are almost entirely among Republicans and independents.   
Of course, there are also surveys about favorable vs. unfavorable views of Trump--the reason I looked at DeSantis first is that there aren't as many about him, so it's a more manageable job.  I'll look at changes in approval of Trump in a future post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Within the second-largest of Michigan's state parks resides the second-largest waterfall east of the Mississippi: Tahquamenon Falls. ("Tahquamenon" rhymes with "phenomenon.") The falls are actually a series—the largest of which, called the Upper Falls, stretches 200 feet wide and 48 feet high. Downriver of the Upper Falls you can find the Lower Falls, a series of five waterfalls cascading around a rowboat-accessible island.

The falls were first made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's "The Song of Hiawatha," in which the main character Hiawatha builds his canoe "by the rushing Tahquamenaw." Long before white men like Longfellow set eyes on the falls, however, it was long-used as a hunting and fishing site by the Ojibwa natives. Then, in the 1800s the river was used by loggers who used its current like a highway to transport timber harvested from deep in Michigan's upper peninsula to mills along the riverbank. 

The trademark brown, cola-like color of the river is due to tannic acid absorbed from the surrounding cedar trees. Because of the color fo the water, this feature is known to some as "Root Beer Falls."

More recently, the falls made an appearance on Sufjan Steven's 2003 album Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State in the form of a song title.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Experience a journey through the ancient past, traversing 150 million years of history, to unearth the mysteries of the beasts that once roamed the very ground on which Dinosaur Ridge sits today. Over 250 dinosaur footprints await you, along with crocodile scratches, and other trace fossils belying the ancient ecosystem.

Dinosaur Ridge offers visitors the chance to view and touch actual dinosaur tracks and dinosaur bones dating back to the Jurassic period. These tracks were first discovered in 1937 during the construction of the West Alameda Parkway.

Clues to unlock the past come in all sorts of shapes and sizes along the 2-mile round-trip trail, culminating in one of the most significant dinosaur bone quarries in North America, where Stegosaurus was first identified, and important research is still ongoing. Interpretive tours are available (and recommended!) with expert guides. Dig into the prehistory of this geologic and paleontologic wonder. The park offers full guided walking and bus tours, as well as a self-guided audio tour.]]></summary>

As another round of storm clouds approached, I walked onto a small wooden dock and filled a jar with water, shoving a few pieces of marsh grass inside. My expectations were low as I drove back to the rental house and started looking at the sample through my microscope. Then I screamed.

The pieces of grass were coated with slimy brown film, and within it I saw a tiny, teardrop-shaped scaly cell wall with curved blue-green structures inside. These were the telltale signs of something even I, a microbiologist, had never expected to find in a random North Carolina swamp.

        <updated>2023-08-14T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inaugurated in 2019, the eye-catching artwork 'Listen' in the center of Umeå depicts a roaring muscular feline sitting atop an almost cage-like steel structure 10 feet (3 meters) above the ground. The animal sculpture, which has an open gap filled with golden bronze, is made of polyester composite with Mazda red lacquer on the surface.

This permanent public installation symbolizes the Municipality of Umeå's official stance against sexual harassment. It's also the first monument in Sweden entirely dedicated to the social MeToo movement. While the formal name of the artwork is 'Listen,' locals call it "the MeToo cougar."

The sculpture was created by Swedish artist Camilla Akraka (who is the sister to former Olympic athletics star Maria Akraka). She has described her installation as "conservative aesthetics of power that meets a story of liberation," referring not only to the MeToo awareness campaign but also to the monument's contrasts between the free organic feline and the traditional powerful material qualities such as steel, car paint, and gold.

When the €50,000 artwork was erected, it faced opposition from some local politicians who argued that allocating funds for what they perceived as "political art" was wasteful, particularly in light of recent education budget cuts. Even some feminists expressed concerns over the monument, viewing the representation of a cougar as "objectifying" towards women. However, the artist defended her work, emphasizing that the animal sculpture was never intended to be species-specific.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In modern vampire lore, the process for becoming undead typically involves a darkly romantic setting, a fang-y bite, and a long, dramatic drink from the neck. But that’s the result of the last hundred years or so of vampire stories. In post-medieval Poland, undead evil was far more banal and less elegant; it was believed to possess the souls of those who had the misfortune to die early in epidemics, by suicide, or simply before being baptized. So when it came time to bury these poor souls, care was taken to ensure they would not provide an easy vessel for a malicious, supernatural force.

In late July 2023, archaeologists working on a 17th-century cemetery outside the southeastern Polish village of Pień excavated the remains of a child who appeared to have been interred in the period's "a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nevada and the rest of the West were generally crisscrossed by stagecoach lines during the latter 19th century and even into the early 20th. It was a dusty, difficult, time-consuming, and an uncomfortable way to travel—but if there was no railroad, there were few alternatives.

Many of these old lines were ephemeral, with little trace left today. Other routes are now followed by modern highways. In a surprising number of cases, however, the line persisted for a decade or more, but the route is still about as remote as it was back when the stages were thundering. Sometimes the original destinations became ghost towns. Sometimes the modern highway takes a route that was impractical in the old days, through being too steep for horse-drawn vehicles, or simply being too expensive for the resources at the time, as by requiring prohibitive amounts of excavation, or bridges that were beyond the state of engineering.

Pritchard's station lies on one of these abandoned routes. It was on the Belmont-Tybo-Eureka stage line from the 1870s into the 1880s. It even had a post office briefly in 1874. The ruin consists of a sturdy building with stone block walls on the outside, the remnants of a wooden roof, and some dilapidated interior wooden walls. Although a few foundations, probably from stables and pens, also occur just north of the station, it now appears as an incongruous lone building out in the desert.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chaekgeori is a unique genre of still-life painting that flourished during the Joseon dynasty of Korea, especially under the reign of Emperor Jeongjo (1776-1800). Typically, it depicts bookshelves full of “books and things” (chaekgeori), a pleasant eye candy to bibliophiles of all ages.

It was also a thematic inspiration behind the Gyeongui Line Book Street project in the Mapo district, intended to be a multipurpose cultural hub utilizing books to enrich people’s lives. Another inspiration was the Hongdae neighborhood surrounding it, an area with a high concentration of publishers in the past.

The vibrant Book Street runs for nearly four miles along Gyeongui Line, on the disused railroad tracks converted into a scenic promenade. It’s home to fourteen bookshops specializing in different themes and genres, all housed in train-shaped booths.

The promenade, a popular haunt among locals, also boasts a collection of book-themed public artworks, such as the statue of a girl standing on a library ladder and picking a book from the shelf.

Hip, refined, and relatively peaceful, Book Street is an intellectual oasis in the metropolitan hubbub of Seoul, perfect for solo walks, cute dates, or simple biblio-shopping.]]></summary>

Due to the changing economic and social landscape in Italy in the 1960s, many puppeteers abandoned their careers for something more lucrative. The association opened the museum with the goal of rejuvenating the puppetry scene in Sicily.

The museum houses a wide range of puppets, including the largest and most complete collection of pupi from the Sicilian-based Opera dei Pupi, a  marionette theatrical representation of Frankish romantic poems that dates back to the early 1800s. Other exhibits include puppets from all parts of the globe, including Japan, Thailand, Congo, Java, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and more.

Herbaria – collections of pressed, dried plant specimens—are a less-known but important type of natural history collection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Kiyotsu Gorge has been appreciated as a site of natural beauty for many decades, but its popularity is only a recent development, thanks to an art installation that turned its panorama into a fantastical vista into another world.

The pedestrian tunnel was constructed in 1996 to respond to the demand of locals and tourists who wished to see the Gorge better, as the hiking route had been closed off due to a lethal rockfall accident in 1988. The tunnel stretches on for about half a mile, with three observation points midway and the "panorama station" at the end.

Described by some as "nothing but a boring tourist trap," the tunnel's popularity kept going downhill, the number of visitors steadily decreasing over the years. In 2018, however, it was chosen as one of the hundred-odd locations hosting the triennial Echigo-Tsumari art festival, with Chinese architect Ma Yansong of MAD Architects fame in charge of its artistic makeover.

The permanent art installation, "Tunnel of Light," is nothing excessive that gets in the way of the panorama, but compliments the outstanding nature. Consisting of stainless steel walls and a thinly flooded floor, it creates a dreamlike reflection of the mountains beyond. Thanks to this Instagram-perfect feature, the number of visitors to the Kiyotsu Gorge more than quadrupled after the tunnel was revamped. Though not as widely known internationally yet, it may be just a matter of time until it becomes one of the top tourist attractions in Japan.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quartz, silicon dioxide (SiO2) is one of the most common minerals in the Earth's crust, and occurrences of massive quartz (so-called "bull quartz," in miners' jargon) are common. They are distinctive, the white quartz typically standing out prominently from the background of ordinary rock, and bull quartz also sometimes hosts valuable mineral deposits. The gold in the hard-rock mines of the Mother Lode on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, for example, typically occurs in quartz.

So, when this large quartz deposit was discovered not long after the Gold Rush, the prospectors thought they'd discovered a bonanza, and the town of Crystal was laid out in 1864. However, the quartz proved to be barren. For a couple of years, a sawmill in Crystal cut timber for the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad a few miles south, but after the railroad bypassed the settlement, Crystal rapidly withered. Most people and businesses relocated to the new railroad town of Verdi, in Nevada, just east of the California state line.

During World War II, some quartz for high-performance electronics was quarried, but the quarry has since reverted to public land now administered by the US Forest Service.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Butrint, located on the southern coast of Albania, is an ancient city that boasts a rich history and a unique blend of influences from various civilizations throughout the Mediterranean area.

The site was first settled by the Greeks in the 7th century BCE and then became part of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century BCE. Over the centuries, Butrint was also influenced by the Byzantines, Venetians, and Ottomans. This mix of civilizations and diverse types of architecture makes Butrint an exceptional archaeological site, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1992.

What's truly special about Butrint is its well-preserved state, allowing visitors to witness the layers of history that have shaped the city. From temples, basilicas, and theaters to defensive walls and castles, there is a rich array of structures to explore. The ancient theater, which dates back to the 3rd century BCE, stands out particularly showcasing the fusion of Greek and Roman architectural styles.

Moreover, Butrint is not just a historical marvel, but also an ecological treasure. The hilly landscape within a protected area on the edge of Lake Butrint and the Vivari Channel makes it a significant habitat for various bird species and other wildlife. Visitors who want to combine archaeological exploration with nature walks can find great opportunities in this national park, which covers almost 9,500 hectares.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Andark was originally formed in 1976 as a commercial diving business in Southampton, England.  Andark divers would work on everything from surveying ship hulls to underwater construction. In 1980, the company diversified and started a scuba diver training program.

In 2011, the business expanded yet again. On the high ground behind Andark, a small yet deep lake was constructed. This bowl-shaped lake, known as Andark Lake, became one of Europe's first purpose-built scuba diving lakes. Today, Andark Lake is still one of England's biggest leisure diving schools.

Today, the area surrounding the lake is a nature reserve. Andark Lake employees work to make sure the lake doesn't have a negative impact on local wildlife, even ensuring the water is filtered naturally through reeds and weeds. The lake is also used for open water swimming (including ice swimming in the winter), camping, and the very rare helicopter landing spot.

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yokohama-customs-headquarters"/>
        <updated>2023-08-10T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The city of Yokohama is home to a major international seaport, one of the busiest since 1859. Located close to its pier is the customs headquarters, an unusual historic building one might expect to find in Morocco rather than in Japan.

Constructed in 1934, the Yokohama Customs headquarters is nicknamed “the Queen’s Tower” for its turquoise-domed minaret, and the rest of the building matches its style, with Moorish battlements and arched windows, partially inspired by ancient Indian architecture. There are also elements of Romanesque architecture here and there, creating an exotic vibe fit for a hub of international relations.

The construction plan was conceived as part of the Reconstruction of the Imperial Capital project, which sought to restore disaster-damaged cities in eastern Japan, as the original customs office was lost in the cataclysmic earthquake of 1923.

Initially planned to be 154 feet (47 meters) tall, another 13 feet (4 meters ) were added to its height at the suggestion of the customs director. As a result, the Yokohama Customs building became the tallest structure in Yokohama at the time of its completion.

Incidentally, the "queen" does not refer to any historical figure, but simply to the playing card, with the Kanagawa Prefectural Government office standing in for the King and the Yokohama Archives of History's clock tower for the Jack. Located close to each other, the three towers of Yokohama are a somewhat popular spot, best viewed from Ōsanbashi Pier.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we think of breathtaking landscapes, the Arizona "Wave" natural landform often comes to mind, captivating visitors with its mesmerizing wavy lines sculpted by the forces of geology and wind erosion. However, at the same latitude in Shaanxi Province of China lies a spectacle with even more stunning scenery—the Jingbian Red Wave Valley in Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province. 

The Red Wave Valley is a fascinating example of the Danxia landform, primarily characterized by its striking red sandstone formations, which took shape between the Permian and Triassic periods, hundreds of millions of years ago. Over time, the relentless forces of wind and rain have meticulously crafted the landscape, creating a sinuous pattern akin to layers of rocky waves seemingly rushing toward the viewer. 

Unlike the red and white hues in Arizona, the Jingbian Wave Valley boasts a pure red palette set amidst the golden plateau. This vibrant red is anything but monotonous; it weaves intricate and captivating patterns as if each layer tells a unique story. Consequently, the locals affectionately refer to it as "Flame Danxia."

The Jingbian Red Wave Valley offers various areas for exploration, each with its own distinct charm. Many of the pathways are paved to provide easy hiking and to preserve the delicate sandstone for generations to come.]]></summary>

The houses bear witness to Eastport's early years. The seventh house was the first post office in the new community, which Murphy named after his hometown in Eastport, Maine. When the glass factory closed in 1902, Murphy's Row fell into disrepair.

In the early 1980s, the properties were redeveloped and sold as private residences. They are Eastport's only remaining example of the 19th-century rowhouse style.]]></summary>

The rodent—a member of the ubiquitous species Rattus rattus, which arrived in North America with the Jamestown colonists—was living between the walls in a building that had variously been a home, a shop, a school, and a popular tavern.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina, the ruins of a colonial open-pit iron ore mine are located on the hillsides of Nanny's Mountain. The mine was operational from approximately 1760 to 1820. Prior to the Revolutionary War, the iron mine fueled early industry in the area and was used to make pots, kettles, and other household items. During the war, the mine supplied ore for cannonballs, round shot, swords, cannons, and other weaponry.

The area around the mine saw several important Revolutionary War battles, including the pivotal battle of King’s Mountain, where American colonists soundly defeated British forces on October 7, 1780. It's possible that iron from this mine was used to make necessary supplies for the battle and may have made an important contribution to early American history. After the Revolution, some historians believe that this site was a stop on the Underground Railroad. 

The mine pits can be viewed and explored along the short trail within the Nanny’s Mountain Historic Site Park. Pictures do not do justice to the size or depth of the pits. Keep in mind that these pits can be a safety hazard, so explore carefully.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Del Valle colonia (neighborhood) in Mexico City expanded in the 1960s, the small Catholic chapel that served this area became too small, so the local residents financed the construction of a larger building. Designed by architects Amaury Pérez de la Huerta García and Honorato Carrasco, work on the Parish of Divine Providence started in 1968, and was completed in 1974. In the midst of the Mexico City Summer Olympics, the city was caught up in a Modernist fervor, so many buildings designed at the time followed this architectural current.

This Parish's floorplan and appearance are somewhat like that of an open-hand fan, semicircular and defined by its 12 triangular panels that represent the 12 apostles of Christianity. Each of these features stained glass windows with geometric motifs in warm colors, a departure from the multicolored, figurative windows of many other places of worship. Another departure from traditional Catholic architecture, especially in Baroque-heavy Mexico, is its rather minimalistic interior.

The altar, located in the center of the semicircle, features a textured golden curved wall below a circular skylight which causes it to shine most of the day, with a cross hanging in front. The wall is framed by a pair of triangular structures featuring a wooden texture, making the interior relatively sober. The stadium-like seating surrounding the altar was designed as a result of a recent Vatican Council, which had determined that churches should strive to create a closer physical connection between altar and congregation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a corner of the green lawns surrounding Qutub Minar, this towering monument of the Delhi Sultanate and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a leftover from the British Raj period, it's known sd called Smith's Folly. At first glance, it's nothing out of the ordinary, just an unassuming pavilion complimenting the garden, but it once stood on top of Qutub Minar.

Built-in the early 13th century, the tower originally stood well over 300 feet tall and underwent several repairs throughout the ages. In 1803, its cupola was severely damaged in an earthquake, and Major Robert Smith of the British Indian Army sought to repair it. His pillared cupola was installed in 1828 as the sixth story of the tower but removed in 1848 as its architectural style was unfit for the ancient monument.

The cupola, dethroned and placed on the ground in the shadow of Qutub Minar, came to be known as Smith's Folly, as it simply serves no purpose. But perhaps it was a folly from the very beginning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked away within the enchanting grounds of Jeppa S Trädgård in Osby, Sweden, the country's oldest olive tree stands as a testament to the unexpected marvels of nature. This extraordinary olive tree, believed to be between 500-700 years old, defies its geographical limitations.

The tree belongs to the Hojiblanca variety, one of the 262 olive varieties cultivated in Spain and among the approximately 700 olive varieties found worldwide. Hojiblanca olives are utilized both for pickling and the production of olive oil. This particular tree originates from the Elche region in southern Spain.

Jeppa S Trädgård itself is a nine-acre botanical haven, featuring greenhouses representing various climatic zones, including tropical, Mediterranean, and a recently added subtropical greenhouse spanning more than 500 square yards.

The garden also houses a specialized plant shop offering a diverse selection of fruit trees from temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions. Visitors can enjoy refreshments, including coffee and ice cream, within the greenhouses. Additionally, the garden boasts a rhododendron collection of approximately 850 plants and a range of unusual trees, including the mammoth tree, bread fir, variegated beech, ginkgo, and aralia, scattered across the meadow and forest edges.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Much like its sister Fort of San José el Alto, the Fort of San Miguel was built in the 18th century. Both forts served to defend the city and the Bay of Campeche from pirate attacks. As a Colonial stronghold of Spanish authority, the city was often targeted by piracy, some of it actively encouraged by rival European powers like the British and Dutch.

While the Yucatán Peninsula is generally known for its flatness, the presence of two hills in Campeche made for the perfect locations for both forts, which saw most of their action throughout the 19th century. After the establishment of independent Mexico and the decline of piracy, they would both eventually become museums. For the Fort of San Miguel, its role as the local archaeology museum has been much longer-lived and unchanged. Since its establishment in 1986, the museum has focused on mainly showcasing Maya artifacts from sites in the state, such as Calakmul. The bulk of its collection, however, spread across 10 halls, is made up of Jaina-style figures.

Located within the modern-day Petenes-Ría Celestún Biosphere Reserve, Jaina Island is believed to have been artificially built during the Maya Classic period and inhabited between 600-1100. Jaina meaning: temple or house on the water, has become the namesake of a style of clay figurines found there and on its nearby mainland. The figurines are noted for their unique detailing, which has led to them being highlighted in this museum.]]></summary>

It was built for Thomas Plant, who at the time owned the largest shoe factory in the world, and school teacher Olivia Dewey Plant, who married Thomas in the spring of 1913. The pair met when they were both traveling in Europe in the fall of 1912, and soon got to work on their home in the mountains.

The sculpture, known as one of the largest environmental sculptures in the Western Hemisphere, was built to adorn the local Highlands Business Park. Commissioned by Jane Mathes Kelton, an heir of Scottish television magnate Curtis Mathes, in 1984, the sculpture has a long and surprisingly controversial history. 

During and after the installation of the park, local churches began to claim that the sculptures were Satanic. In a coalition loosely helmed by megachurch minister Michael Tummillo, over two dozen clergypeople started a crusade against the sculpture.

I think I got it today! For every spherical harmonic (ell and em), there are three vector spherical harmonics obtained by multiplying by the radial vector, taking the transverse gradient, and taking the transverse gradient and crossing it into the radial direction. I think these can be generalized (using, say, the Ricci calculus) to make the 2-tensors and so on. If I am right, this is a new way to represent tensor fields on the sphere.

But for archaeologists, that option—so enticing to normal people—might be a second choice to a fragment of bread that has been incinerated with a human corpse, then entombed for a millennium or two.

Though its name simply means “scented candle” in Thai, this double-wicked curl of beeswax is no ordinary room freshener. Tian op is a flavoring agent, or rather, a scenting agent, used to enhance specific dishes in Thai cuisine.

Chefs light the U-shaped candle at both ends, place it on top of the food to be scented, and cover it with a lid. Lack of oxygen snuffs the flames and the enclosed space fills with flowery smoke. Minutes or even hours later, the chefs lift the lid and serve the food, now garnished with the candle’s delectable aroma.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Darlingtonia Trail is named for the bog that it snakes around, filled with Darlingtonia californica, carnivorous pitcher plants. Called the cobra lily because their shape resembles an upright cobra, these plants lie in wait to strike at insects, their main source of nitrogen.  

At the first platform on the trail, you can see the bog in full bloom. At peak season, its full of hundreds of these gorgeous pitcher plants, some with bright flowers growing out. A few miles from the bog, the Smith River churns along. The area is full of a mineral called serpentine, which is gray-green in color and gives the Smith its brilliant blue-green color. The weathering of the serpentine produces magnesium, silica, and iron in the soil. It reduces the levels of calcium, potassium, and aluminum. To get the nitrogen and phosphorus that the plants need, they turn to a different source:  insects. 

The pitcher plants have evolved to secrete nectar that attracts flies, ants, spiders, beetles, butterflies, and moths. They enter the plant and slide down into its long trumpet-shaped gullet, full of downward-facing hairs and slippery wall, becoming trapped at the bottom. There, the insect drowns and is slowly consumed by the plant. This is an extremely beautiful but extremely metal plant. 

Speaking of metal, the area was extensively mined during and after the California Gold Rush. On the trail, you can also see a test mine shaft, probably dug to test for suitable minerals and metals to dig. They must not have found anything here, but the area has produced gold, chromite, and copper.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty have been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009. Built to honor the ancestors and to assert their royal authority, many of the tombs consist of a huge burial mound and several temples.

Scattered over 18 locations across the Korean Peninsula, it’s not easy to see everything in one go, but one location has a huge cluster of royal tombs. Located in the city of Guri, right outside the perimeters of Seoul, is Donggureung: The Nine Eastern Royal Tombs.

The largest royal burial site in South Korea, Donggureung (also transliterated as Dongguneung) is home to the resting places of 17 kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty, originally founded by the order of King Taejong in 1408.

The “nine tombs” consist of Geonwonneung (King Taejo, 1408); Hyeonneung (King Munjong and Queen Hyeondeok, 1452); Mongneung (King Seonjo and Queens Uiin and Inmok, 1600); Sungneung (King Hyeonjong and Queen Myeongseong, 1674); Hwineung (Queen Jangnyeol, 1688); Hyeneung (Queen Danui, 1718); Wonneung (King Yeongjo and Queen Jeongsun, 1776); Gyeongneung (King Heonjong and Queens Hyohyeon and Hyojeong, 1849); and Suneung (King Ikjong and Queen Sinjeong, 1890).

In addition to these royal tombs, with their red pavilions, burial mounds, and funerary statues, the Donggureung complex also contains Myeongbinmyo (the grave of King Taejong’s concubine), the caretaker’s house, and a small museum. Surrounded by a serene forest and typically not as crowded as other historic attractions in and near Seoul, it’s quite a lovely place; one major shortcoming, perhaps, is that you can’t get close to the main parts of the tombs, as all the mounds are fenced at the foot.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the far northeastern tip of Arabia exists a landscape like no other. Separated from Oman proper by the United Arab Emirates, the Musandam Peninsula reaches toward Iran and into the notorious Strait of Hormuz with delicate, dramatic mountains of barren red rock falling into an emerald sea.

These are the only desert fjords in the world.

Known locally as khors, these jagged coves were created by the collision of tectonic plates instead of the glacial activity that shaped their Nordic and Alaskan cousins. But the uncanny similarities still persist with 6,500-foot (2,000-meter) mountains and razor-thin spines of rock towering over deep water teeming with wildlife. Dolphins, rays, and a variety of colorful reef fish can be found throughout the inlets, and the warm, clear water makes for excellent scuba diving and snorkeling.

Easily explored in a day trip from the town of Kasab, most excursions will be aboard a traditional fishing vessel known as a dhow. Between vibrant local history lessons and fascinating facts of geography, guides may even free dive for scallops freshly served as ceviche with a bit of lemon and spices.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[San Diego is California's second-largest city by population and is proudly referred to as "America's Finest City." It has a reputation for being in close proximity to Mexico and home to all branches of the United States armed forces. However, it is perhaps most well known for its 70 miles of beaches. 

Unless an avid and practiced sea diver, few visitors probably have little experience or knowledge of what is living in these watery depths. This is what makes the Map of the Grand Canyons La Jolla Shores so unique. Unveiled in October 2020, this 2,200 square-foot LithoMosaic not only depicts over 100 variety of species, (including aquatic varieties, as well as birds, mammals, and reptiles) but also the geological formations that can be found in and around this beachfront property.

The map was created to honor what would have been Walter Munk's 103rd birthday. Munk was an Austrian-born oceanographer who worked at the nearby Scripps Institute of Oceanography, as well as being a resident of La Jolla Shores. He was an avid proponent of understanding the effects climate change has on our environment, including the impacts on ocean temperatures. 

Along with the Walter Munk Foundation for the Oceans, artist Robin Brailsford and her team of volunteers spent hundreds of hours mapping out and creating the massive display. Visitors are encouraged to walk on the art piece and discover the intricate details, as well as gain an understanding of what is taking place under the nearby waves. This includes 3-D models of reefs and the varying shades of blue tiles to indicate the various depths of the ocean floor.]]></summary>

She was unable to move, and according to stories, the only object that she enjoyed was a tall dollhouse with clear windows that her father George had built for her. When Lova passed in 1908, she was buried and the dollhouse went with her to the grave, or so the story is told.

Some news articles speculate the dollhouse was built specifically for the grave, which was not an entirely uncommon style for the region. Regardless, Lova’s father had requested the dollhouse be destroyed at the death of himself and Lova’s mother but the community rallied to disinter Lova and move the dollhouse to where she is now buried with her parents.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Extraterrestrial Highway, also known as Nevada State Route 375, cuts through nearly a hundred miles of lonely desert and borders the mysterious military base known as Area 51. The road has become a pilgrimage for those in search of signs of government conspiracies and life from other solar systems. But those who traverse this desolate land looking for aliens will miss the wonderful weirdness of its otherworldly geology, millennia-long human history, and uniquely adapted species. It’s worth seeking out close encounters with the terrestrial oddities and wild wonders of Route 375.

The most decadent substance on Earth, to me, is brown-sugar crème brûlée boba. My favorite version contains brown-sugar syrup drizzled into milk, a thick layer of milk foam with crispy broiled caramel on top, chunks of flan studded throughout, and, at the very bottom, a scoop of warm boba pearls.
  Soft, chewy, and perfectly pearl-shaped, tapioca-based boba originated in 1980s Taiwan, and has since spread around the world, usually at the bottom of a cup of sweetened iced tea. You could write a whole dictionary of boba terminology: Both the tapioca balls and the drink itself can be referred to as boba. Not only that, but boba also goes by a number of other names: …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The unassuming canteen attached to the long-standing Indian YMCA mouthwatering dishes are on display from self-serve, all-you-can-eat buffet trays showcasing local dishes from across India’s culinarily diverse 29 states. The affordable prices (ranging from just £6.50 for breakfast to £13 for lunch and dinner), make it as much of a favorite among local office workers as the students lodging there. 

Favorites among patrons include chicken korma and biryani, while Thursdays are dedicated to South Indian dishes like sambar, a spicy lentil soup. Freshly prepared home-style curries (the Kerala fish curry, egg curry and butter chicken are popular options), tandooris, onion bhajis, and dhal offer a filling feast for the senses. Rice and condiments, as well as drinks such as coffee and Chaas, a refreshing herb-infused yogurt drink, are complimentary.

The canteen, located on the building’s ground-floor Mahatma Gandhi Hall, is a central hidden gem for many Londoners, situated near Fitzroy Square and just a three-minute walk from Warren Street Station. Established in 1920, the hostel is a hub for the young Indian diaspora community in London, and offers a rich culinary and cultural space for British Indian history. Thanks to the communal dining hall setup, where tables are often shared between groups of strangers, conversations with new folks are common, lending to a comfortable, almost family-like atmosphere. 

While YMCAs are historically Christian institutions, the Indian YMCA prides itself on being an interfaith organization that embraces and celebrates all communities. Residents and visitors alike appreciate the inclusive environment where shared experiences warmly bring people together—regardless of religion, language or cultural heritage.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tea is said to have originated in China about 2,700 years ago. It was brought to Japan by a mission of monks returning from Tang, and its earliest cultivation was in 1191, when the Buddhist priest Myōan Eisai sewed tea seeds in the Iwakamibō gardens of Ryōzen-ji Temple, Saga, not far from the ancient settlement of Yoshinogari.

Initially meant to be a medicinal plant, Japanese tea soon evolved into its own kind, with a culture of tea ceremonies developing over the years. Eisai's tea became what is known as matcha today. It was widely appreciated by Buddhists practicing zen, as they believed it improved one's body and spirit.

On the grounds of Shōfuku-ji Temple in Fukuoka, the oldest zen temple in Japan originally established by Eisai himself, stands a direct descendant of his tea trees, known as the "Japan's First Tea Tree." A small, nondescript tree with lean branches at first glance, it may not be anything extraordinary, but its influence on traditional Japanese culture is irreplaceable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking through narrow, winding alleys of the Noryangjin district of Seoul, you may be reminded of gritty scenes from the Bong Joon-Ho film Parasite, a milestone in Korean cinema that took the 2020 Oscars by storm.

While much of the filming took place at several locations in Seoul, the neighborhood is not especially featured in the film—except for a small, unassuming pizzeria called Sky Pizza. It’s nothing out of the ordinary, just a run-of-the-mill place with the usual menu. But on its façade and interior are autographs of Bong Joon-Ho, as well as the logo and delivery boxes of the fictional “Pizza Generation” restaurant from the film.

Parasite follows the tragicomedic lives of the poverty-stricken Kim family as they struggle to make ends meet, each member gradually infiltrating into the wealthier Park family, only for chaos to ensue. In one of the numerous low-income side jobs that the Kim family takes up, they fold delivery boxes for a local eatery: Pizza Generation. Later, the pizza place makes another appearance where the Kims are seen scheming on how to kick the housemaid out of the Park household.

In real life, Sky Pizza is a quiet family-run pizza joint. The owner will proudly offer visiting cinephiles the chance to take pictures with the Pizza Generation boxes, and bring you sketchbooks full of signatures and messages from Parasite-loving visitors from around the world, so that you can leave your own mark as well. Flipping through these pages, you'll see what a huge influence the film has had on a small local business like Sky Pizza.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Polk Theatre is a historical landmark that has been a central entertainment hub for nearly 100 years. Designed in 1928, the theatre has survived hurricanes, fires, and even a near-demolition in the 1970s. But thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Lakeland community, the Polk Theatre was saved and continues to stand today as a testament to the city's love for the arts.

Walking into the Polk Theatre is like stepping back in time. The art deco style of the building immediately transports visitors to a different era. The bright neon lights and intricate ceiling details make anyone feel like a movie star. And speaking of movies, the Polk Theatre has been showing them for almost a century— from silent films to talkies to new releases, the theatre has seen it all.

But movies aren't the only form of entertainment at the Polk Theatre. The venue also hosts live performances, ranging from plays to musical acts and symphony concerts. The acoustics in the theatre are second to none.

The Polk Theatre is not just a building made of bricks, but it is a place of great emotional significance to many. It is a cultural icon that has withstood the test of time and has been a source of joy for generations. All in all, the Polk Theatre is a cornerstone of Lakeland's culture and a testament to the city's love of the arts. Whether you're watching a classic movie, attending a live performance, or a guest at a private event, the Polk Theatre is the place to be.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vientiane, the capital of Laos, is home to many Buddhist temples and monasteries. With its foundation dating back to 1563 during the Lan Xang period, Wat Si Muang is one of the oldest and best-known temples here, most popular among locals.

In the past, Wat Si Muang was once associated with royal rituals, sometimes hosting coronation ceremonies. The popular myth claims that it was named after a local pregnant woman, Si, who sacrificed her own life to call upon an ancient guardian spirit to protect the city from an oncoming flood.

Another version of the story, perhaps resulting from mistranslation, has it that multiple pregnant women were sacrificed to prevent evil spirits from causing a disaster. Either way, the mythical Si Muang continues to be remembered and honored as a hero.

The temple itself houses a copy of the Emerald Buddha statue and a sacred stone pillar called the Lák Méuang, an ancient monument believed to enshrine the guardian spirit of the city, as well as several mini-shrines throughout the premises, some gorgeously kitsch. Right outside the temple also stands an imposing statue of King Sisavangvong, the first ruler of the Kingdom of Laos.]]></summary>

High winds tore at Gothic Mountain as the sleeping giant watched over the cabins nestled in Gothic, Colorado, a remote outpost accessible only by skis during the valley’s harsh alpine winters. The plumes of snow that lifted from the peak briefly appeared to form a cloud and then disappeared.

To many, the snow that seemed to vanish into thin air would go unnoticed. But in a region where water availability has slowly begun to diminish, every snowflake counts. Each winter, an unknown percentage of the Rocky Mountain West’s snowpack disappears into the atmosphere, as it was doing on Gothic Mountain, just outside the ski resort town of Crested Butte.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barbeque, or siu mei, is a crucial part of Cantonese cuisine, and Hong Kong is full of shops and restaurants that excel at it. Everyone has their favorite, and for a lot of siu mei aficionados, that’s Sun Kwai Heung, a humble little take-out spot in the far eastern reaches of Hong Kong island. 

Everything is made on-site, from crispy-skinned roast pork to soy sauce chicken, to char siu, barbecued pork butt that is dipped in a gloriously sticky maltose glaze. The latter, in particular, is their specialty, and it’s not surprising to find a queue spilling out onto the sidewalk at certain hours of the day when it’s due to come out of the oven. 

You can customize your order by letting the staff know how fatty you’d like the char siu to be – if you’re unsure, boon fei sau, which means “half-lean half-fat,” is a good place to start. Char siu—or any Cantonese barbecue, in fact—can be enjoyed on its own as a snack or appetizer, like charcuterie, or pair it with plain rice to make it a proper meal.]]></summary>

Not to say that this low-fi hangout doesn’t make a proper drink—it just does so without taking itself too seriously. It’s one of the few places you’ll find cocktails made with Chinese liquors, from the traditional rice-based Yuk Bing Siu, to Magnolia, a recent local invention featuring Chinese medicinal herbs.

If you’re not in the mood for cocktails, there’s an excellent rotation of craft beers, both imported and local, on tap, bottled, or canned, as well as mocktails, and a neat menu of Asian-inspired dishes, from Okinawan taco rice to Sichuan fried chicken. Stop by any time of day (they also do great coffees)—it’s the kind of place where anything goes and you certainly wouldn’t be judged for day-drinking.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many of Hong Kong’s dai pai dongs (street stalls) have either closed down or moved indoors over the years, and fortunately for congee lovers, Mui Kee belongs in the latter category. Opened in 1979 as a street stall, and now located on the top floor of a wet market, Mui Kee specializes in fish broth-based congee.

Toppings are cooked to order, and each serving of congee is finished off in a copper pot on extremely high heat, in a manner similar to stir-frying in a wok. Congee purveyors using this technique are few and far between these days, making them a rare gem—little wonder that the stall is busy even in summer, despite the lack of air conditioning. 

Fresh fish belly is a specialty here, but you’ll find all the classic toppings like pork meatballs, sliced beef, pork innards. and century egg, as well as essential side dishes like savory Chinese doughnuts and steamed rice rolls.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hong Kong-style egg tart, with its jiggly custard center and just-baked pastry crust, sits proudly on almost every local bakery's shelves, and has done so for the better half of the past century. So for a Swiss-Frenchman to change up the recipe, and make his version an absolute hit that has queues round the block with tourists and locals alike, is no mean feat. 

This baker, Grégoire Michaud, cut his teeth in the pastry kitchens of five-star hotels, and when he launched his own brick-and-mortar, Bakehouse, he wanted to pay tribute to the city he's called home for the past couple of decades by creating his spin on this local favorite. 

His egg tart has a flaky laminated sourdough base; its center meltingly creamy, and intensely eggy, but it’s not the only thing you should get—the pretzel croissant is satisfyingly chewy, sprinkled with just the right amount of salt, and the beef rendang pie will make your palate sing. Keep an eye out for one-off seasonal specials.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Established in 1930 on a plot of 200 acres in Lloyd Harbor on Long Island, the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception trained future clergy members in the Diocese of Rockville Center, including Nassau and Suffolk counties, for 82 years, until the educational programming relocated to Yonkers in 2012. But before the land was purchased by the diocese in 1924, it was owned by Ronald Roy Conklin, a descendant of the original colonizers of Huntington and the owner of the North American Trust Company, which grew from a successful real estate partnership.

Conklin and his wife, the famous opera singer Mary McFadden, settled on what was then known as Rosemary Farm in 1913, living in a 30-room mansion overlooking Lloyd Harbor. Perhaps more fascinating though, is a treasure that lies just beyond the ruins of the home—an outdoor amphitheater built as a gift for McFadden.

Designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, of Central Park and Prospect Park fame, it hosted the National Red Cross Pageant in 1917, drawing thousands of guests and featuring a march led by John Philip Sousa. The amphitheater had an unusual design, with a moat in the center separating the audience and the performers on stage—quite the way to handle pesky hecklers!

When the property was purchased by the diocese, the amphitheater fell into disuse, but has since been restored by the folks at the seminary. Few venture beyond the main building to explore the wonders in the backyard.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dairy isn’t part of the traditional Hong Kong diet, yet most Hongkongers would consider local-style milk tea a staple, and even a symbol of the Hong Kong identity. A much stronger brew than the British original, nai cha, as Hong Kong-style milk tea is known, is made of Ceylon tea and unsweetened evaporated milk, which became widely available after the Second World War. 

These days, it’s found everywhere from fast food restaurants to cha chaan tengs (diners serving localized Western food). Despite being the default caffeine hit of the city’s denizens, surprisingly few places have made the drink their focus. 

My Cup of Tea isn’t devoid of food (there’s a small menu of cha chaan teng classics like fluffy white bread omelet sandwiches), but it’s first and foremost a tea bar, insisting on making their own blend of tea, and putting the brewing station front and center of the diminutive shop. They even host milk tea-making workshops, believing that the beverage isn’t just sustenance, but an important part of the city’s culture and history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During construction works of the new Royal Collections Gallery, a set of ancient ruins was found. They include a section of the oldest Muslim wall, including several remains of houses attached and a pillar, part of the original gate of that primitive Madrid.

The wall was built in the late 9th century and made of large limestone ashlars, similar in technique to the nearby Tower of Bones and the Arab Wall. However, the remains found here are even older. Among these vestiges, it has been interpreted that a door of three meters (almost 10 feet) would correspond to that first gate of Madrid, the Puerta de la Sagra, (Xagra, in Arabic) very similar to the Puerta de Alcántara in Toledo. 

All of these elements are linked to the origins of the foundation of Madrid by the Umayyad emir Muhammad I, in which the existence of a fortress in this place was justified because of its location. It bordered the Christian kingdoms of the north and sat on a high plateau protected by cliffs. 

After being hidden for centuries, the ruins have been incorporated into the permanent collection of the new museum and can be seen through a large glass. A video is projected in an adjoining room where the archaeological site is always in sight. The different parts of the old wall are illuminated. The exhibit shows the evolution of that ancient walled enclosure, first Muslim and then Christian, as well as the construction of the old Alcazar from the Habsburg dynasty to the current Royal Palace built on the Versailles style by the Bourbons in the 18th century.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All across the city of Pune, around every corner, one can find something interesting which takes one back in time, to a bygone era that might be years to decades to centuries old. Along an inner road, a short distance away from St. Paul's Church near Pune Railway Station, in the center of the city, there is an empty patch of land along the side. In the corner of the plot are a number of interesting ancient stone structures. As one observes keenly, they are revealed to be old tombs. 

According to sources, these are European tombs from the 19th century. Historians, archaeologists, and other experts have studied them and have arrived at a number of possibilities regarding their origin and details. Some say these belonged to German soldiers from around 1850, while others are of the opinion that they date back to around 1817 and are of French soldiers who were said to be a part of the Peshwa Army. 

One of the tombs is dome-shaped, supported with stone pillars. According to experts, it belonged to the wife of a French soldier. Along with soldiers, some of the tombs are also said to be those of local Europeans of that era. However, due to the withering of the plaques, it is difficult to ascertain the exact details with any degree of certainty. 

One of the tombs has a tree growing vertically out of the stone slab. Another one has mysterious circular symbols carved over its sides. Then there is one which is completely covered with creepers while another has a gnarled tree trunk resting at an angle over its top. Since this place is along an inner road, not many people know of its existence, despite it being located in the center of the city. 

It is a fascinating spot to explore on a weekend and thus discover this lesser-known side of the city’s history, particularly for people who have a penchant for mysteries.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coimbra is one of the oldest cities in Portugal. Home to the most prestigious university in the country, it served as the first capital of the Kingdom of Portugal and has had a strong monastic presence ever since. Across the river from the main part of town stands the ruined Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha. Originally founded by Lady Mor in the late 13th century, it became a favorite of Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, who built her palace next door.

The monastery operated until the early 17th century, when flooding from the Mondego River forced the nuns to move uphill and leave the monastery. And there it sat for 300 years, until it was excavated in the late 20th century.

Santa Clara-a-Velha is most famous for being the execution site for Ines de Castro. In 1340, King Afonso IV arranged the marriage between his son Pedro and Constanza Manuel of Castille. Much to Afonso's displeasure, Pedro fell madly in love with Constanza's cousin Ines, and installed her in Coimbra as his mistress. Constanza gave birth to a son and heir to the throne, but after she died in 1349, Pedro refused to marry any other woman except Ines.

Fearing her influence on Pedro and any future sons they might have, in 1355 Afonso had Ines murdered in the Santa Clara-a-Velha monastery. Pedro had her killers brutally executed, and when Afonso died and Pedro became king, the legend goes that he had Ines' body exhumed and coronated as Queen.

Today, Pedro and Ines are buried together in nearby Alcobaca, but their story has become one of the most well-known tragedies in Portuguese history. As for the monastery itself, it still experiences flooding every now and then, but visitors are now able to access the lower floors of the old monastery, including the choir and old treasury. Santa Clara-a-Velha remains one of the most complete and historically important Gothic ruins in the entire country.]]></summary>

Around the vicinity of the temple, in the busy square, there have been installed a number of artistically-designed streetlamps. These beautiful lamps depict four mice holding a large Modak. As per Hindu traditions, Lord Ganesh’s divine mount is a mouse and his favorite food is Modak, a sweet dumpling dish popular in Indian culture.

These street lamps are a thoughtful creation that add to the aesthetic beauty of the square around the temple. The design is in keeping with the sacred ambiance of the area. They enhance the aesthetic beauty of the temple’s vicinity.]]></summary>

Following the first act, a crew member raised a lit chandelier catching fire to the oil-painted hemp backgrounds. The fire spread quickly through the poorly designed theater, which was built to hold no more than 500 people.

Despite the heroic attempts of an enslaved man named Gilbert Hunt and other brave guests, 72 people including acting governor George Smith perished in the nearly 1,000-degree Fahrenheit flames, reducing the once great theater to ash and rubble.

In 1814, the Monumental Church was built to memorialize those who perished during the great fire. In front of the church rests an urn, inscribed with the victims' names. Underneath the church lays a crypt in which the victims.]]></summary>

The Appalachian Trail Keeps Getting Longer

by Lizzie Johnson and Lauren Tierney, Washington Post

When it was completed in 1937, the Appalachian Trail stretched 2,050 miles from Georgia to Maine. Today, it is almost 2,200 miles. The Washington Post has mapped the most substantial of the thousands of route changes—and the highway construction, exhausted hikers, and bad smells behind them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Riviera Ballroom, built in 1933, was a regional destination for live music from its opening until the early 1980s. The ballroom was the site of numerous performers that included Glenn Miller, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington among many others.

Singers of the era that performed there included Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Mel Torme, the Andrew Sisters, Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day, Perry Como, Billie Holiday, and Lena Horne to name just a few.   

In 1972, the Riviera Ballroom was turned into a privately-operated nightclub called “Top Deck” which operated until the early 1980s. Artists who performed at Top Deck included Donna Summer, Chubby Checker, Herman’s Hermits, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, Gloria Gaynor, Chaka Khan, the Village People, and Cheap Trick, among others.

A more complete list of the performers is listed on the wall on the 1st floor of the Riviera building (which is open to the public and has several small shops open from spring to fall).

The ballroom recently underwent an extensive renovation and now is a popular venue for weddings and other private, special events. While usually not open to walk-through, the inside is clearly visible from the exterior windows on the second-floor landing.]]></summary>

Even though x is one of the least-used letters in the English alphabet, it appears throughout American culture—from Stan Lee’s X-Men superheroes to “The X-Files” TV series. The letter x often symbolizes something unknown, with an air of mystery that can be appealing—just look at Elon Musk with SpaceX, Tesla’s Model X, and now X as a new name for Twitter.

You might be most familiar with x from math class. Many algebra problems use x as a variable, to stand in for an unknown quantity. But why is x the letter chosen for this role? When and where did this convention begin?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many a French summer holidaymaker in the 1950s, stuck in an un-air-conditioned backseat on their way to the coast, would grow gleeful over an odd but charming sight: windows rolling down to welcome the wares of (car)door to (car)door nougat salesmen, peddling the confection along the infamous seven-hour traffic jams congesting the Nationale 7 trunk road—N7 for short.

This chewy, taffy-like treat is emblematic of the local terroir, featuring Provence’s lavender honey and sweet almonds. While nougat can be found anywhere from Marseille to Avignon, Montélimar, located about halfway between Lyon and the Mediterranean coast, has been a cradle for the confection for centuries—and the presence of nougatiers on the Nationale was a distinctly Montélimar phenomenon.

They were thinking of using svyrecvar, the variance estimation function that underlies most things in the package. That’s not actually the easiest approach: svyrecvar works with estimating questions, but for the kurtosis we don’t have estimating functions and instead have an explicit definition in terms of totals: \[\kappa = \frac{E[(X-\mu)^4]}{E[(X-\mu)^2]^2}.\] It’s likely to be easier to work with svycontrast and represent \(\hat\kappa\) as a function of estimated moments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore a South Florida 1960s relic that’s as in flux as the beachfront tides themselves. Every day at the Swap Shop is something new, with kitschy interiors and mysterious vendors that are always changing.

Swap Shop is the perfect combination of mass-produced discount grime, liminal spaces, garage sales, and a perpetually creaky carnival. From ever-churning children’s rides to DIY robot statues, old movie promotional items, grillz makers, indoor go-karts, arcade machines, and flower shops, Swap Shop has it all. You can visit just to take in the nonsensical decorations or to try your luck shopping.

If it exists, it exists at the Swap Shop in its most discounted, off-brand form. You can buy adult DVDs from a white windowless van and pick up themed tourist mugs just a few footsteps away.

On weekends, visitors are treated to paid parking across the street with a bright yellow pedestrian bridge to safely usher them into the world of dust, rust, and mystery. The bridge has its own strange statues that help set the tone. Weekdays are calmer, allowing visitors to park closer to the building.

Discounted flea market finds await at every corner. And for the empty stalls, relics of old movie promotional posters, dusty homemade decorations, and strange dioramas keep things entertaining. There are two floors of indoor booths plus semi-permanent outdoor container booths and an ever-changing lineup of cars selling their wares in the drive-in theater’s wavy parking lot.

Speaking of cars, the building also seems to inexplicably host a collection of flashy collectible cars—though it has dwindled in size in recent years.

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/llanthony-priory-wales"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Constructed in the early 12th century as a rural sanctuary far from the perils of war, Llanthony Priory continues to offer visitors a retreat from the pitfalls of modern life, even if the building itself hasn’t stood the test of time.

The grand abbey was founded by Norman knight William de Lacy, who—in a highly unconventional move for the time—traded the battlefield for religion, and created a hermitage in the shadows of Brecon’s Black Mountains.

During the height of its popularity, up to 40 religious canons lived on-site at the abbey and visitors travelled to see it from around the world. Sadly this period of prosperity did not last. Following Henry VIII's set of 16th-century laws that worked to dissolve British monasteries, the site was largely abandoned and left to the elements.

And yet, even as a ruin, the Monmouthshire site exudes a tranquil beauty befitting a monument that was once one of Wales’ great medieval buildings. Symmetrical stone arches still stand in a grand row, along with a few turret-topped stone towers, providing a sense of the scale of the original priory. So picturesque are the weathered remains that famed British artist J.M.W. Turner traveled here to paint them in 1794 (a watercolor that now hangs in the Tate Britain in London).

And then, of course, there’s the pub. Hidden beneath the 900-year-old site, in what is thought to have once been the abbey’s cellar, is a wonderfully cozy undercroft bar, where in-the-know patrons duck down into a cave-like space to sample the selection of local ales on tap.

The old-worldly drinking den is run by the Llanthony Priory Hotel, which is attached to the site. The hotel has been set up to retain a sense of the abbey’s original role as a retreat from the modern world, and, as such, offers no in-room TVs, no wifi, and not even any mobile phone signal.

Along with drawing hikers, history buffs, and quirky pub enthusiasts, the area is also famed for its stargazing credentials, offering exceptionally clear views of the cosmos after dark.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bell of the Fallen looms over travelers from its perch in the Italian Alps and delivers a solemn message.

Visitors can walk or drive up the winding, sun-soaked streets of this sub-alpine, Italian town to reach a natural promenade overlooking the Brenner Valley—home to the world's largest free-swinging bell. Guests can stand beneath it in awe of its size, or at sunset. 

The bell is more than a novelty. It's a loud and living reminder of Italy's darkest history. The Italian front was one of the bloodiest of World War I, and the Brenner Valley saw more than its share of violence. In memory of the fallen, cannons from both sides of the conflict were melted and cast to create this peace memorial.

Around the bell is a garden of sculptures and art installations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you think riding a bicycle is exciting, imagine racing 40 miles an hour along steep curves without extra gears or brakes to stop you. This scene happens frequently at the Dick Lane Velodrome, Atlanta’s official home of track cycling. While this velodrome is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary, many Atlantans are unfamiliar with this hidden gem.

The Dick Lane Velodrome is located just eight miles south of downtown Atlanta, in East Point’s Sumner Park. Residents of East Point were inspired to create a velodrome after watching the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The group saw the racers on the Radstadion Velodrome in Olympiapark and decided they needed their own track. (

The course was completed in November 1974 at a cost of about $200,000. Some of the funds came from the Federal Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, the East Point Recreation Department, the State of Georgia, local civic groups, and East Point residents. Dick Lane, the namesake of the Dick Lane Velodrome, was a major fundraiser for the track. Lane was the Director of the East Point Recreation Department and a member of the Georgia State Legislature.

The Dick Lane Velodrome is a 1/5-mile track with 36-degree banked turns. In addition to the track and judges’ stand, it has a parking area, concession building, public seating, a picnic area, and restrooms. The track also offers equipment rentals. It is the only velodrome in the world with a green space containing a large oak tree and a creek running through the infield.

The East Point Velodrome Association, the non-profit group that manages and maintains the track, hosts a number of events throughout the year. Highlights include: Bicycle Safety Clinics, Beginner’s Program, Youth Cycling League, Advanced Training, Weekly Racing, and Pro Racing Series.

There are about two dozen active velodromes in the United States. The closest tracks to the Dick Lane Velodrome are in Ashville, North Carolina, Rock Hill, South Carolina, and Cooper City, Florida.]]></summary>

Although these giant herbivores were once pushed to the brink of extinction by the United States government, careful conservation efforts have helped stabilize populations.

This particular herd consists of around 250 animals, which roam free over 400 acres designed to simulate their natural habitat. Unlike a zoo, this gives visitors the chance to see these charismatic megafauna behave much as they would in the wild. The best time to visit is in mid-May, when around 40 to 50 calves are born each year.

In addition to learning about the bison, visitors can learn more about the history of the Native Americans prior to the arrival of European colonists. There is also a gift shop with souvenirs, as well as bison meat and snacks for purchase.]]></summary>

These dinosaurs aren’t millions of years old and never took a gulp of air. They’re dapper Victorians, made of cement, wire, stone, and clay. They were entertainers and educators, meant to give New Yorkers their first glimpse of the prehistoric creatures that once roamed New Jersey forests and Connecticut lakeshores. But in 1871, these carefully crafted, life-size models were destroyed, smashed into worthless smithereens, and then buried in a small mound in Central Park. According to historian Vicky Coules of the University of Bristol, the event remains the “greatest act of vandalism in the history of dinosaur study and museum development.”

A dryland forest in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, Kabra remembers how the monsoon that year had turned the trees so green that it hurt her eyes. In the flush of harvest, homes of the local Sahariya people overflowed with goods gathered from the forest, notably chir: a fragrant, green-yellow resin, also known as Indian frankincense, that comes from the salai tree.

Kabra expected to visit Kuno just a couple times, but the place got under her skin, she says. She grew to love its dramatic cycles of drought and abundance. After each rain, the dry brown landscape transformed into a verdant paradise. When Kabra started teaching at Ambedkar Unive…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the highlights of Oslo's Norsk Folkemuseum, or Norwegian Museum of Cultural, is a collection of 160 historic buildings relocated from around the country. The crown jewel is the collection of King Oscar II, considered by many to be the world's first open-air museum. First set up at the monarch's summer residence in 1881, the original five buildings included a 16th-century farmhouse and a 12th-century storehouse.

Most impressive of all is the Stave Church from Gol, a magnificent wooden cathedral first built around 1200 and partially rebuilt and restored in 1880. Intricate carvings cover the richly detailed interior.

Although the church was once filled with brightly painted statues of Catholic saints, today all that remains are the places where the figures once stood and occasional cryptic runes. The nave of the church still reads “Kiss me, because I struggle,” possibly in reference to one of the lost sculptures.]]></summary>

Thanks, that will be fixed in the next version.  You are also reading a section that is much simpler than before (I think/hope), so I hope you like it.  But there is also a higher chance of errors or infelicities, so please let me know if you are not happy.  

The proof of Krull's Principal Ideal Theorem is the same, and I continue to be unhappy that I have not internalized it.  But the rest has become much nicer (after I've talked with people, read some Hochster and Qing Liu and some others, and imbibed more folklore).]]></summary>

In a nearby perfume distillery, a man turns his head towards the laughter as he crushes a batch of discarded kulhads. Here in Kannauj, a town in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, generations of perfumers have used kulhads and other clay materials to capture an enticing scent known as mitti attar.

“It’s the smell of the baked, parched earth when the first rains arrive after a long drought,” says Rajat Mehrotra, co-owner of the family-run Meena Perfumery. Perfumers like Mehrotra, who runs the company with his brother, have been bottling the enigmatic fragrance for centuries.

These fossils are about 80 million years old, from the late Jurassic to late Cretaceous period, and are very well preserved. The patterns and shapes are all unique and diverse.

But his conclusion was so odd that it took years of excavation and testing to show international scientists that his convictions were right, according to Urbina’s field partner and fellow paleontologist Rodolfo Salas-Gismondi, head of the vertebrate paleontology department at the Museum of Natural History in Lima. They were fossil masses, and what Urbina thought they were: preserved bones from a new species of early whale, dating to 39 million years ago. And, it turns out, this one was a whopper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madrid was once a city with various walls protected from attackers. Gates were crucial to ensure movement in and out of the city which explains why Madrid is still today a city of gates.

Many of the gates once located around Madrid were demolished. Some still remain, while others have given their name to the place where they were once located. 

Puerta del Sol (Sun Gate) is actually a square and not a gate, but it owes its name to a long-gone gate that was decorated with a sun and was known to locals as "La Puerta del Sol."

There are two possibilities for the origin of the name Puerta del Sol for the square. One of them according to municipal records states that the square got its name from a sun-decorated medieval wall shutter that was destroyed in the 17th century. The other theory is that a gate was built with the sun's rising direction in mind—to the east.

The square has undergone many refurbishments, but this symbol remains as a nod to the past.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Karen, a leafy suburb of Nairobi, chef Dennis Ang’ani whips up a unique fusion experience for just 12 visitors per seating on a greenery-laden cabin terrace. The multi-course dining concept is primarily inspired by local produce and traditional East African recipes done up with culinary techniques picked up by Ang’ani abroad.

Root and vine vegetables are freshly plucked from Embark’s own gardens. Ingredients are showcased using European techniques, from foams to fermentation, with elaborate presentations, and occasional garnishes of flowers plucked from Nairobi’s Physic Garden.

Expect a walk on the earthy side: a chilled banana and rum soup with a garden salad in Bailey’s and macadamia nut vinaigrette, seared tofu in Ethiopian shiro (a spicy chickpea sauce), or mini plantain burgers. Vegetable-based desserts often tread into especially wild, savory territory; from Amarula-braised eggplant with aerated broccoli ice cream, to ugali (corn maize) with creamed spinach.

All in all, the menu reflects Ang’ani’s multicultural experiences. After growing up in a German-Kenyan household, he moved around Europe working in kitchens from the Baltics to Barcelona, and fluently speaks German, English, Swahili, and Spanish.

Though as a child he dreamed of becoming a pro soccer player in Europe, he maintains that bringing an innovative approach to the African fine-dining scene has been a more fulfilling challenge for him than any league could be; and even requires similar skills like dexterity, teamwork and performance under pressure. 

A picture of Coach Pep Guardiola, one of Ang’ani’s heroes, hanging from a wall-mounted handwoven basket, helps him to remember the importance of being a good leader and most importantly, to never be limited by conventionality and cultural borders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Devil's Porridge refers to the explosive that was mixed at HM Gretna. Gun cotton and nitroglycerin were kneaded together by the munitions girls to make RDB cordite. This mixture got its name because looked like a deadly form of porridge.

Prior to the building of HM Grenta, this location was quiet, with only a few farms and villages in the area. Then World War I began. In just 12 months, the government acquired the land and built a massive factory. The HM Gretna site was huge, it covered a distance of nine miles, stretching down to England.

There were 30,000 workers, 12,000 of whom were women. Lots of the munitions girls moved to the area, especially to work at the factory, moving from areas like Durham, Darlington, and Sunderland. The chemicals were highly toxic, the girls' skin would turn yellow and they often lost all of their teeth. The contribution to the war effort made by the munitions girls here at HM Gretna helped women achieve the vote in the United Kingdom.

By 1917, the factory was producing 1,100 tons of cordite a week. This was significantly more than all the other munitions factories in Britain put together. This explosive was then shipped out to the troops on the front line.

The museum has a special version of a train, a fireless locomotive, designed to safely transport the explosive on display in the grounds. The museum tells the story of the girls who worked here and the Irish navvies who built the massive factory.

It also covers a horrific troop train crash at Quintinshill. While the second floor is dedicated to WWII. With a small section covering nuclear power and the local nuclear power station.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a familiar siren blares through the small town of Eden on the coast of New South Wales, Australia, people start to gather. It’s not a warning of a tsunami or other disaster, but for a far more pleasant occurrence: a whale sighting.

Occasionally, a baleen whale, such as a humpback, strays from the migratory superhighway off the coast and into Twofold Bay in Eden. The alarm atop the tiny town’s killer whale museum is sounded to notify the town’s 3,000 or so residents and any tourists to this scenic stretch of coastline. Over 150 years ago, the town hosted a different marine show. Orcas, or killer whales, the largest of the dolphin family, used to visit this bay every winter, and were vital to a unique way of life in Eden. Humans didn’t just watch the orcas, but rather worked side by s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upon first glance, this may look like just another historic building found across Boston. However, upon entering the Liberty Hotel, one realizes this was no ordinary building but rather once a jail that was in operation for more than a century.

Originally known as the Charles Street Jail or  Suffolk County Jail, it's located on the west end of the city overlooking the Charles River. It was constructed between 1848-1851 and proposed by Mayor Martin Brimmer during his inaugural address of 1843 as a replacement for the older Leverett Street Jail.

The original jail was built using Quincy granite with four wings extending from a central octagonal rotunda and housed around 220 cells. The prisoners were segregated by sex and nature of offense with 30 arched windows providing ventilation and natural light.

Throughout its years of operation, it housed a wide range of inmates from mob hitmen to a former governor. In 1973, the United States District Court ruled that due to overcrowding and neglected conditions, the constitutional rights of the inmates were being violated and the jail closed in 1990. It reopened in 2007 as the Liberty Hotel with much of the historic architecture still preserved.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí did not venture much outside Catalonia to work. One of those few occasions was when he accepted the chance to work on this palace in Astorga, León.

Bishop Joan Baptista Grau I Vallespinós decided to entrust the construction of the new episcopal palace to his friend Gaudí, who just like the bishop, came from Reus, Tarragona. Gaudí's imaginative touch is evident in the innovative use of materials, incorporating iron, brick, and ceramics alongside traditional stone.

Gaudí made a significant mark on the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, Spain, with his distinctive architectural style. The palace, constructed between 1889 and 1915, stands as a brilliant fusion of various influences, showcasing Gaudí's innovative ideas and artistic vision.

The most striking feature of Gaudí's intervention in the palace is the facade. Adorned with a combination of organic and geometric motifs, it reflects his fascination with nature and its organic forms. The building's interiors also bear Gaudí's creative flair, with unique decorative elements and functional yet aesthetically pleasing spaces.

Gaudí's work on the Episcopal Palace in Astorga exemplifies his ability to transform existing architectural designs into masterpieces that harmoniously blend traditional and avant-garde styles. The building stands today as a testament to Gaudí's genius, drawing visitors from around the world to marvel at its beauty and architectural significance.]]></summary>

At Atlas Obscura, we adore the spectacles lurking beside roads all over the world, so we asked: What turned your heads recently recently?
Since then, we received more than 600 images of fascinating sights. Readers sent us technicolor dinosaurs dressed up for Halloween, black-and-white gravestones, curious art hidden in deserts. Reviewing these submissions reminded us how much fun it can be to make stops on a long journey—or perhaps a roadside attraction is your destination!

Check out our wonderful winning photos (click to see the up close), selected by our staff—the first place winner is above. We hope it will inspire many great summer road trips!
Congratulations to our winners, who scored some Atlas Obscura gear!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bees and wasps drinking water to cool themselves down isn’t an unusual sight on a sweltering summer day, but a tiny drinking fountain tailor-made for their kind may be rather rare.

Hitokotonushi Shrine in the city of Jōsō, Ibaraki Prefecture, is known for such a drinking fountain catering to the thirsty little bees, which has been set up every summer since 2020. This small act of kindness has been appreciated by hundreds of bees—and warmed the hearts of thousands.

The honeybee drinking fountain was first created in 2016, but it did not reappear for the next four years due to the lack of apian visitors during that time. Attached to the ablution pavilion, the fountain’s platform is made from bamboo and stuffed with moss, which provides a footing for the bees and creates the feeling of a serene fairytale scene.

The small sign standing on the drinking fountain reads “a drinking spot reserved for groups of honeybees,” but paper wasps are also often seen drinking water from it. They do not only drink water to cool themselves down, but also carry it back to their hives to keep the temperature comfortable so that the babies are not harmed by the summer heat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although nobody can guarantee whether the remains of Ibn Battuta are really kept inside this impressive white mausoleum, this is perhaps the closest one can get to one of the greatest explorers in history.

Ibn Battuta, the famous Moroccan explorer, and traveler, is widely regarded as one of the greatest travelers in history. He embarked on a remarkable journey in the 14th century that took him through Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and beyond, covering a distance believed to be over 75,000 miles.

Battuta was born in Tangier in 1304 and set out on his travels at the age of 21. His adventures spanned nearly three decades, during which he explored various regions, experienced different cultures, and met numerous rulers and dignitaries.

His written account, known as the Rihla, provides invaluable insights into the medieval world, shedding light on the diverse cultures, customs, and political landscapes of the places he visited. Battuta's travelogue serves as a significant historical source, capturing the socio-economic conditions, religious practices, and intercultural exchanges of the time, making it an indispensable resource for scholars and a captivating literary work that continues to inspire wanderlust and cultural curiosity.

There are plenty of historical markers or memorials related to Battuta in the city, given his significant contribution to Moroccan and world history. As a prominent figure, he is also celebrated throughout Morocco and the broader Muslim world for his travel accounts and contributions to geographical knowledge.]]></summary>

Today I met with Maya Nesen (NYU) and Ana Pacheco (NYU) to look at  raw spacecraft data. Nesen is working on the tabulated housekeeping data, giving the position and orientation of the spacecraft and instruments in various coordinate systems (that we are trying to work out). Pacheco is working on the raw imaging data from the imaging module. We discussed how to display the imaging so that an astronomer can confirm the the noise level and rough noise properties in the pixels. We discussed adjustments to our plots of the housekeeping data to aid in our interpretation of it. In particular, we looked at some of the camera-related meta data and it looks like the camera might have a few different zoom settings. I guess we have to read some documentation!CassiniCassini]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Across the United States, there is no shortage of historical churches. Ranging from different time periods, denominations, and congregations, churches across America have been a defining feature throughout the nation's history. Although many churches have a unique history, there is one church in Framingham that has a particularly notable distinction as being the first public performance and singing of the Battle Hymn of the Republic.

The church was founded in 1701 and by the time of the American Civil War, it was called the Hollis Evangelical Congregational Church. On the evening of February 22, 1862, the residents of Framingham gathered in the church to celebrate the 130th anniversary of George Washington's birthday and read aloud his 1796 farewell address as encouraged by President Lincoln via national proclamation three days earlier. The speech was read by Norman School principal George Bigelow and the program was concluded with the singing of Battle Hymn of the Republic by Julia Ward Howe which was published in The Atlantic Monthly that same month. 

The song became extremely renowned in the United States with its abolitionist and religious themes resonating strongly with supporters of the Union cause during the American Civil War. It was one of the most popular songs among Union troops and became a staple of United States military music. Today, it's considered a classic patriotic song with many renditions, tributes, and parodies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pune shares a wonderful relationship with hills. Both within and around the city, there are several lush green hills where visitors can find historic forts, temples, monuments, and caves.

ARAI Hill, also known as Vetal Hill, is the highest point in the city at an elevation of over 2,000 feet. The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) is located here. A temple of Vetal and a few other temples are also located on the hill. A short distance from ARAI and the temples is a large abandoned stone quarry that has formed a lake.

The quarry is a paradise for nature lovers. Every morning and evening, people visit the hill for walking, jogging, photography, bird watching, yoga, meditation, exploring nature, and watching the city from one of its highest points. The hill is accessible from multiple areas, as there are walking trails from all sides. All the trails converge towards the center at the top, where the stone quarry lake is located.

Some portions of the hill are covered with dense trees, while others are grasslands. The quarry lake, with its marshy areas and shallow waters, has created a wetland with an ecosystem of its own. One can spot several rare and exotic bird species here.

The hill is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The views offered from here are breathtaking. One can see the city stretching into the distance where there are more hills at the horizon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Billiken is one of the many iconic mascots of Osaka, alongside the Glico marathon runner and the gigantic crab. Also called Billiken-san, this narrow-eyed dwarf with an onion-shaped head is said to be a lucky god, particularly revered by merchants who believe that rubbing the feet of his effigy brings you good luck. While he is well-known across Japan, it often goes unmentioned that he does not originate in Japan, but in Kansas City, Missouri.

Billiken, the "god of things as they ought to be," was designed circa 1907-1908 by illustrator Florence Pretz for her friend Sarah Hamilton Birchall's stories published in The Canada West magazine. He instantly proved to be a hit, exceptionally profitable (except to the designer herself, much to her chagrin). Billiken statuettes were warmly receive…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia presided over the inauguration of the Queen Victoria Bridge on June 13, 1909. The bridge was named in honor of the king's wife. It connects Bombilla Park, the two hermitages of San Antonio de la Florida, with the Colonia de San Antonio de La Florida and the Colonia del Manzanares.

Based on a design by architect Julio Martnez-Zapata Rodriguez, it was built by engineer José Eugenio Ribera Dutaste. The bridge includes two, parallel elliptical reinforced concrete arches that are decorated in modernist style. It also has two lanes for cars. Additionally, Queen Victoria Bridge is one of Spain's earliest concrete bridges. Four vases and eight cast-iron lampposts decorated by Francisco Iglesias with bears serve as its adornment.

During the Second Spanish Republic, the bridge changed its name to Puente de Galicia. After the Spanish Civil War, it recovered its original name. On one of its sides, visitors can see a commemorative plaque placed on June 13, 1999, to celebrate its 19th anniversary.

Its ornamental components, which are mostly concentrated on the board, reflect the modernist trends of the day. Four vases and eight iron lampposts (two and four at each end) are placed on it, at the base of which different rampant bears appear, in a clear reference to the heraldic shield of Madrid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1899 when the Moore-Lindsay Historical House was constructed it cost approximately $5,000, ten times what the average home in the area cost to build. William Moore and his wife Agnes were an important part of society in Norman. The house was later sold to Agnes’ niece and her husband, Harry, and Daisy Lindsay.

The remnants of Daisy Lindsay’s locally famous rose garden can still be seen on the property next door. In the 1960s, the family sold the house and it was divided into apartments. They didn’t last long, however, before the building was condemned. The city of Norman saved the house and opened it as a museum in the 1970s. 

The museum is now furnished as an example of the typical Oklahoma Victorian house. The house contains artifacts from around Cleveland County, including a woman’s side-saddle ridden by Martha Giles in the Land Run of 1889.        

The museum hosts frequent events for both adults and children, including tea parties, soap-making, embroidery classes, children’s camps, and even paranormal investigations.]]></summary>

Standing in the market square, the “Fat Policeman” statue was created by Finnish sculptor Kaarlo Mikkonen (1920-2001) and has since become a beloved icon of the city. Nicknamed Uncle Karl, the affable bronze copper is clad in a circa-mid-20th-century uniform, complete with a dated helmet and a dapper mustachio.

Uncle Karl is notable for his belly, which has a gloriously golden patina—a clear sign that it has been rubbed by many. Local superstition has it that rubbing his belly grants you good luck and immunity against weight gain so that one can enjoy as much Hungarian food as they like.]]></summary>

The menu, dated to February 17, 1941, is from the Warner Bros. Studio Cafe in Burbank, California. What made it so fascinating was the sheer amount of food and the number of midcentury oddities on offer. The hungry starlet or sound technician, if their wallets allowed, could start with imported caviar, follow it up with a T-bone steak, and finish their meal with a glass of half-and-half.

Rivers have been the lifeblood of human civilization throughout history, and yet we know surprisingly little about what lives in many of them—including the giant creatures that prowl their depths.

While we know the biggest animal in the ocean is the blue whale and the largest marine fish is the whale shark, the identity of the world’s largest freshwater fish species long remained a mystery.

Until 2022, that is, when fishers in Cambodia caught a giant freshwater stingray in the remote reaches of the Mekong River.

Weighing an astounding 661 pounds, the stingray surpassed by 15 pounds a giant catfish caught in Thailand in 2005 that had previously been considered the unofficial …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coyoacán was once a town completely separate from Mexico City. As such, it needed its own central square, what is now the Plaza Hidalgo. When this plaza was being built, a large stone ring with a figure carved on it was unearthed. This was a tlachtemalácatl, the name in Náhuatl (the language of the Aztec/Mexica people) for the "goals" of the Mesoamerican Ballgame. Known as tlachtli, variants of this game were played by the Indigenous peoples of most of Mexico and Central America, almost always with ritualistic and symbolic purposes.

This particular malacatl of the tlachtli game was so well-carved that it was kept after being found, and eventually placed in a prominent position in the Jesús Reyes Heroles House of Culture, in what is now the Mexico City borough of Coyoacán. This cultural center was once an actual house, and its late 18th-century architecture shows it. It also functioned as a paper factory for some time, and in 1985, was established as a House of Culture.

Its namesake, Jesús Reyes Heroles, was a significant 20th-century intellectual who delved into law, politics, and history. Usually advocating in favor of democratic values and human rights, his legacy led to many institutions other than this center being named after him.]]></summary>

Thanks!  I see what you mean, and it definitely could be.  The one with times maps to the one with the otimes, which maps to the right side of that map in the notes.  So we're both right.   I want to write it like this so the two vector vector bundles (the two sides of the "\times") are most visible.

(And thanks for your other suggestions and corrections you sent by email; I think I owe you a response, and if so, hope to get to it soon.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started writing in a possible grant proposal (that would be in collaboration with others) about the trustworthiness of machine-learning emulators. Emulators are systems that learn the input–output relationship of a computationally expensive simulation and produce (or speed the computation of) new simulation outputs, reducing total computational requirements for a given number of simulations. These are so important now that the ESA  and  data-analysis plans crucially involve emulation.EuclidSimons Observatory
The issue is: How do we trust that the emulators are giving good outputs? There is no obvious way to test them, except by comparing to held-out training data. But in large-scale structure contexts, no amount of held-out data can test the enormous input data space. I don't know how we will ever trust such systems (and damn do we need to!), but I have some ideas about how to improve the situation. One involves enforcing physics symmetries on the emulators. Another involves running adversarial attacks on them.]]></summary>

Deep in the mid-winter Maine woods in 1902, a young chemist persuaded six lumberjacks to be his lab rats. For one 18-meal work-week, he cataloged every scrap of food the men were about to eat, then he collected all the relevant feces, sealing them in “museum jars” and freezing them in a snowbank cache. With the cooperation of the camp cook, he also assembled and froze samples of every type of food served to the men. He then transported all these icy jars to the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Maine at Orono for analysis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the minerals of a mining town have been fully extracted, there is a chance that it will become a ghost town. That is what happened to Real de Catorce in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí when its silver ran dry in the early 20th century. But it was never completely abandoned. 

The land around the town, particularly the desert below, is known as Wirikuta, the sacred land of the Huichol people. Real de Catorce has long been a pilgrimage site for them due to its proximity to Wirikuta. It's also a place of pilgrimage for Roman Catholics. The Parish of Immaculate Conception Cathedral draws visitors hoping to ask a favor from Saint Frances Assisi.

Today, the town sees pilgrims of a different sort, namely tourists in search of the magic that keeps visitors coming to this out-of-the-way location. When silver mining ended over a century ago, the town's population dropped down to the hundreds. Today the town has around a thousand permanent residents. The sizable tourist flow keeps its small hotels busy. 

Much of the town is abandoned. Be sure to visit the historic bullfighting ring and its amphitheater. A hike up to the hills will give you a panoramic view of the town and its surroundings. Throughout the town, the Huichol sell their intricate, colorful artwork.]]></summary>

In August 2023, a new Broadway play is opening at the Golden Theater on West 45th Street in New York, The Shark Is Broken, about the trials, tribulations, and humor of the making of the movie—Jaws, obviously—that changed the film industry.

The play dramatizes the bickering between three stars of the film—Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and Robert Shaw, whose son Ian co-wrote and stars in the play—and the difficulties of having a giant, animatronic shark as a scene partner. Back in 1974, it wasn’t just the fake shark that presented challenges—the production was menaced by real live sharks before the real filming e…]]></summary>

One miner in particular, Henry Chaffey, lived in this isolated hut for over 40 years with his wife Annie Fox. Visitors today will be struck by the isolation of the building, tucked between mountains and forests. One can only imagine how lonesome it would have been a hundred years ago. However, Annie was always glad to greet visitors in her impressive Edwardian-style clothing.

Chaffey would make visits to Motueka and Takaka by foot for provisions and to sell what he was able to mine in order to support himself and his wife. This trek would have taken him days to complete.]]></summary>

But the Khan’s tomb is properly called a cenotaph—a monument to someone buried elsewhere—because it is empty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just off the bustling Magazine Street in the Irish Channel, the National Shrine of Blessed Father Xavier Seelos welcomes visitors to learn of the mystical life of the “Cheerful Ascetic.” The Redemptorist order established the site to promote the canonization cause of Seelos.

Born Francis Xavier Seelos in Bavaria, Germany in 1819, he eventually pursued a religious life and was ordained by the Redemptorist order in 1842. Seelos traveled to the United States, first residing in New York to minister to German-speaking immigrants. During his lifetime, Seelos witnessed the chaos of the American Civil War. Father Seelos urged President Lincoln to excuse seminarians from military service during the conflict. He transferred to New Orleans in 1866 where his life ended from yellow fever a year later at the age of 48.

An in-depth account of his life is portrayed at the center, which includes a wide range of artifacts including his original lead coffin. His cilice and flagellum are on display in the Walk of Life section of the campus. Hours and days of operation vary and large groups are encouraged to make arrangements in advance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[August 2023 promises to be a big month for the Moon. On August 1 and August 30 (Eastern Time), the orb will be near its perigee—its closest point to Earth—and the full moon will loom large in the night sky, a phenomenon brilliantly branded as the "supermoon." The full moon on August 2 is the Sturgeon Moon, a name drawn from the belief that the best fishing occurs under its glow, and the one on August 30 is a Blue Moon, the relatively rare second appearance of a full moon in a single month.

But even when the moon isn't at its (seemingly) biggest and brightest, humans have been entranced by it as a celestial body. From the Atlas Obscura archive, explore centuries of attempts to map, explore, own, and even spend eternity on Earth's only natural satellite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All week I have been discussing with Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA) the possibility that we could find the elusive, truly zero metallicity stars in the Milky Way halo. This from an email I wrote today, reacting to the observational point that no-one has ever seen such a star:
How could there be absolutely ZERO zero-metallicity stars in the Milky Way? Here's everything I got:

Maybe there are literally no low-mass stars ever made at zero metallicity. Absolutely none, at high precision. This is possible, given how little we know about star formation and the IMF.
Maybe stellar evolution is so weird at zero metallicity that low-mass stars go dark by 13 Gyr. I very much doubt that this is a possibility. But maybe low-mass stars at primordial abundances never burn and just slowly collapse into white-dwarf-like condensed objects on a very long cooling timescale. They would be super cold by now, like 100 K maybe??
Maybe low-mass stars form slower than high-mass stars in star-forming regions at zero metallicity. This permits a few of the high-mass stars to quickly evolve and explode, polluting the outsides of the just-forming low-mass stars. These low-mass stars would then have low but non-zero surface metallicities, and be very alpha-enhanced. This is possible, although would it really leave NO zero-metallicity low-mass stars behind?
Maybe low-mass stars somehow self-pollute at formation (or later in their lives). Maybe the nuclear fusion kicks in slightly before gravitational steady-state or radiative zones are set up, and the first bit of nuclear burning gets mixed in to the stellar envelopes? These stars would appear to have non-zero (but weird, carbon-enhanced maybe?) abundances. Or maybe this happens later in life because of some weird internal mixing. I have literally no idea whether any of this is possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my last post, I asked " why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters on the issue [of abortion]"? I should have said something like "why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters by adopting more moderate positions"?  As I suggested in a post a few years ago, another way to appeal to moderate voters is by focusing on the negative--fears of what the extremists on the other side might do.  That's what the Democrats have done, and it's worked pretty well because many prominent Republicans have taken extreme positions.  Also, there is an asymmetry on the abortion issue--it's easier to find shocking examples of women who were denied abortions that most people will agree should have been allowed (e. g., the case that came up shortly after the Dobbs decision, a 10-year-old rape victim who had to travel out of Ohio to get an abortion) than shocking examples of women who had abortions that most people agree shouldn't have been allowed.  So if it comes down to a contest of extreme positions, the side favoring legal abortion is likely to win.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Indigenous Eats, owner Jenny Slagle and her husband, Andrew, serve Native American dishes prepared using family recipes. Offerings range from Indian tacos to desserts drenched in huckleberry sauce, and ingredients are sourced exclusively from locally owned Native American businesses. Fry bread, which appears here in both sweet and savory forms, is made according to a recipe from the owner’s mother. 

Slagle, a member of the Yakama Nation and descendant of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, always dreamed of running a restaurant for Native American comfort food. For years, she ran an Indian taco stand with her four children and mother at Spokane’s annual Falls Pow Wow. Finally, an inspiring visit to Denver’s Tocabe: An American Indian Eatery, reassured her there was an appetite for such dishes. In 2022, Indigenous Eats was born.

Around the restaurant’s deli-style order counter, walls are adorned with local Indigenous art and traditional melodies resound from the speakers. Exhibits and posters paint a picture of the vibrant Spokane’s Indigenous ancestry, where over 300 tribes in the county have created lively community spaces.

Slagle and her family recipes have proven that even a fast food restaurant can be a powerful medium for preserving heritage and celebrating Native American culture.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last 20 years, this family-owned haven for hearty Polish fare has been gracing downtown Glendale with hunter's stew, pierogis, kielbasa, goulash, cabbage rolls, and so much more. (“A Touch of European” might be more aptly named “A Bear Hug from Poland”). Portions are generous, but save room for dessert, which includes house-baked cookies such as angel wings and kolaczki.

Chef-owner Waldemar Okula is fiercely proud of his homeland—a fact readily apparent to anyone who's gone on one of his annual culinary tours of Poland. Twice a year, he hosts a cooking class where participants either learn how to make Easter classics like white borscht or a Polish-style Christmas feast.

It's BYOB, it's cash only, and it's unlike anything else you'll find in the greater metro Phoenix area. You'll hear the owners speaking Polish amongst themselves and to other diners who've immigrated from the region.

If the specials include a dill pickle soup, order a cup. Do not doubt its power.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Mary Coyle moved to Phoenix from Ohio in 1951, she brought a knack for making ice cream with her from the midwest. Her namesake parlor, Mary Coyle Ol' Fashion Ice Cream, continues to survive and thrive in a smaller, nearby location, 72 years later. At 16% butterfat, the ice cream itself is ultra-rich and is still made on-site to this day using the original recipes that first made Mary a success.

Not only are the options premium, but they're also expansive. The variety of flavors—an unexpected feature for a classic ice cream parlor—is a thrill in and of itself. Choose from a wide range of popular and nostalgic flavors, from black raspberry to black licorice, spumoni to burgundy cherry. Carefully sourced ingredients, such as the nuts in the butter pecan and maple walnut flavors sourced from Mount Hope, in Sedona, make each scoop shine.

The new location's checkerboard floors, neon soda fountain sign, and pink-striped walls (which harken back to the original location) let you know you're in for a deliciously sweet time travel session.]]></summary>

That night, Sakata was looking back on a distinguished six decades at the head of Japan’s top seed company. He had founded Sakata Seed Corporation in 1913, growing it from a small purveyor of lily bulbs into a major multinational developer of flower, fruit, and vegetable varieties. Today, the spaghetti squash can be counted among Sakata’s many successes; but it was far from an overnight one.

Since the 1930s, Sakata had been the exclusive marketer of spaghetti squash in the United States. According to Dr. Harry Paris of Israel’s Volcani Institute Agricultural Research Organization…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The commune and spa town of Bagnères-de-Luchon is situated in the picturesque valleys and hills of southwestern France. Nestled close to the Spanish border, the town sits among the foothills of the French Pyrenees and is renowned for its thermal springs. For centuries, especially in the Victorian period, attracted people in poor health looking to convalesce in a scenic setting. One can easily imagine bourgeois visitors coming to Luchon to bask in therapeutic waters, perhaps as they cough discretely into a bloodstained lace handkerchief.

Today, Luchon's tourists enjoy the benefits of the waters sans illnesses. Modern upgrades to the Thermes buildings demonstrate that Luchon's restorative springs remain as popular as ever with visitors.

The local architecture is a curious mix of Belle Epoque grandeur and Tyrolean ski resort, unsurprising, given that the town also caters to skiers and snowboarders who venture into the snow-capped mountains every winter. The town remains a beautiful spot to enjoy a coffee at a boulevard cafe while admiring the majestic mountain range that dominates the town's skyline.

These breathtaking peaks also captivated the writer, poet, and playwright Edmond Rostand who spent many summers enjoying the unique pleasures of Luchon while residing at Villa Julia, a holiday home built by the Rostand family. Here, Edmond composed love letters and wrote his most famous literary work, Cyrano De Bergerac.   

A commemorative bust was erected in 1922, four years after Rostand's death at the age of 50. The statue features his curly mustache and an unmistakable creative air as the statue looks wistfully into the middle distance seeking inspiration. Appropriately the bust sits where his effigy can view the mountains, the river Pique, and Villa Julia.  

It's a discrete but fitting tribute to a man known as France's National Poet who gave the world one of its most famous literary characters and who found vast reserves of inspiration in the splendor of the Pyrenees and the charming spa town of Luchon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grandma’s cake and chit-chat—that’s the concept behind the lovable Munich café and bakery Kuchentratsch (in German, ‘cake gossip’).

Located in the heart of the Bavarian capital, this sweet haven has perfected the typical German tradition of Kaffee und Kuchen-Zeit (afternoon coffee and cake time) and put it toward a good cause. The establishment doubles as a social initiative startup where all fresh-baked confections are made by local elderly folks.

Founded in 2014, Kuchentratsch serves some of the city’s best traditional German cakes. Depending on the season, and who’s aproned-up that day, a delectable selection may include anything from rhubarb torte to crumb cake (Streuselkuchen) to marble cake (Marmorkuchen). Cakes are displayed in a glass vitrine next to the name of the Oma or Opa (grandma or grandpa) who made them.

Cakes are delivered Germany-wide but for sit-in guests, the bakery provides cozy tables in an inviting interior. Think: large glass windows are adorned with plush armchairs against a strawberry-pink ceiling. Throughout the day, elderly folks bake in an open kitchen and socialize around tables, gabbing while waiting on their oven timers. Pensioners work part-time at Kuchentratsch, and many spend their retirement time getting together here, even when they’re not on duty for the dough.

The wafting aromas of warm treats and happy banter contribute to the ambience that owners Katharina Mayer and Katrin Blaschke always wanted: an interactive “experience bakery” spanning tastes and generations. Along with frequent baking workshops, Kuchentratsch aims to support the elderly with a fun hobby that provides purpose, prevents loneliness and supplements pensions with extra pocket money.

So, whether you go for the poppy seed crumble or a chocolate cake made especially for the vegan crowd, rest assured that, as the German saying also goes in English, “the way to one’s heart is always through the stomach.”]]></summary>

I have been working on this in part because it is a good measurement to make with , and in part because the dipole in the quasars . I have many thoughts, but I will save them for later.Quaiais controversial
Anyways, Abby Williams (NYU) has been working on making this measurement, and her dipole amplitude and direction depend on what we hold fixed and what we vary (in particular selection-function components), and they also depend on what sky region we use. None of this is surprising; the selection function has a strong dipole in it, and it is not known precisely. But then I don't understand how the studies published previously have such good error bars. Maybe they didn't consider the various different fitting regimes?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's often said that "social issues" are more divisive than economic ones, and that increased political polarization in the United States reflects a shift from economic to social issues as the main focus of politics.  A good summary of this view is provided by William Galston, as quoted in a recent column by Thomas Edsall:  first, “The economic axis that defined our politics from the beginning of New Deal liberalism to the end of Reagan conservatism has been displaced," and then  "When the core political issues are matters of right and wrong rather than more and less, compromise becomes much more difficult, and disagreement becomes more intense. If I think we should spend X on farm programs and you think it should be 2X, neither of us thinks the other is immoral or evil. But if you think I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan, an island, cherishes seafood as a culinary staple. For generations, seafood soups and congee used to dominate the breakfast tables and early morning street food stall menus, until they were slowly phased out for more popular wheat-based dishes like scallion pancakes and egg crepes. Emmanuel is one of the few exceptions and has been whipping up comforting bowls of hot tilapia soup for hungry customers in the morning since 1977. 

For decades, the place was an old road side stall servicing blue-collar workers. But in 2021, the third-generation owner convinced his parents to take over and give the brand a 21st-century face-lift. They’ve since relocated to a cozy brick-and-mortar space with indoor seating and air conditioning. 

Despite the refresh, the menu and the prices have stayed exactly the same: whole slabs of fish sourced fresh from the market daily are served in soup, usually paired with a hearty serving of stir-fried rice vermicelli with a heaping of braised ground pork, crunchy bean sprouts, and housemade chili sauce. Every fish is carefully skinned and gutted and served whole—with the head, eyes, and fins still intact. 

While the menu is small, there is something for everyone on it. If fish isn’t your thing, they do a classic egg drop soup or one topped with hearty slices of pork.The best part? The prices for each dish has stayed well under 100 NTD ($3 USD).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real Guts Cafe is a mecca for Taiwanese cinephiles. Stocked with movie paraphernalia and books, it is the brainchild of Taiwanese director Wei Te-sheng, whose Cape No. 7 was Taiwan's second highest-grossing movie of all time and achieved the longest theatrical release in the island’s cinematic history. 

The food is typical cafe fare: coffees, teas, sandwiches, waffles. For something more substantial, they do a decent barbecued pork, sliced into thin pieces, paired with a sunny side-up egg and served over rice. There are grilled rice balls and bright salads. Even local craft beer if one is so inclined. 

However, the food is secondary because the main draw at Real Guts is the decor. There are old film cameras, director clapboards from Wei’s movie sets, and two real Golden Horse awards (considered the Oscars of Chinese-language cinema) on display. There’s also an entire bookshelf brimming with storyboards and set design drafts, plus a merchandise section selling miscellanea like T-shirts of endemic Taiwanese animals. 

While it’s all a bit chaotic, Real Guts draws a consistent crowd of work-from-home folks and students, who like the floor-to-ceiling windows and lush foliage that hangs from the nooks and crannies of the space. Stocked with a reasonable amount of outlets and Wi-Fi, it is a relaxing place to pull up a laptop and get some work done.]]></summary>

They’re very different creatures, for sure, but even species that are rather alike—take a lab rat and a wild, hairless counterpart, the naked mole rat—can have drastically different lifespans, too. Think three years versus 30. We humans can live twice or three times as long as our closest relatives, chimpanzees.

It’s natural to ask which mammal lives the longest. Spoiler alert: It’s the bowhead whale. (There are a few other, non-mammalian creatures that have them beat: a deep-dwelling shark, a clam, a jellyfish that just doesn’t die at all.) But what constitutes a long life can vary widely based on size and lifestyle, metabolism and environment, so maybe the better question is why s…]]></summary>

If you take that route, chances are you'll be passing over the Čertovka, or the Devil's Stream, a quaint little canal that gives the area its nickname: Little Venice.

As you cross a small bridge over the stream, there'll be a post-medieval water mill called the Grand Priory Mill on the other side, just about 50 yards away from the John Lennon Wall. At first glance, it's simply a cute, quaint sight, but then you'll catch sight of a strange figure sitting on the wooden platform beside it. Squint and zoom in, and you will see that it's not really a human figure, but a googly-eyed, green-skinned goblin smoking a pipe.

The Castle Dairy may be the oldest continuously inhabited building in the historic market town, and it's believed someone has lived there since the early 14th century.

Originally built as a farmhouse, the building's subsequent uses are unknown, though it was possibly used as a private residence. The name "dairy" may have been a corruption of "dowry" and it has been inferred that the property was once a widow's home.

While some of the original windows were once bricked up, over the years many of them have been reopened. On the upper floor, there is a small chapel with one of the small windows while the other miniature window looks out from the other side of the house.

One local story claims that the floor contains remnants from a Roman road, which once ran along the banks of the river Kent.]]></summary>

The chorēgia, literally "the leader of the chorus," who sponsored the winning performance received a large winning trophy. In 320 BC, Thrasyllos earned the first-place prize for “Tribe of Hippothontis” and commissioned a monument for his large bronze tripod trophy. He was given the unusual privilege of locating this monument halfway up the south slope of the Acropolis in Athens.

The monument was built with a variety of marbles from local quarries to form a small temple the filled the opening of a natural, large cave. The façade was built as a close replica of the west facade of the south wing of the Propylaea on the Acropolis, with two monument…]]></summary>

The small town's parish church, the Church of St. Peter & St. Paul, features remarkable original medieval wall paintings and welcomes both human and canine visitors. The first church on the site was built by the Anglo-Saxons. But the church was later rebuilt around 1140 following a Norman design. Later additions were then added in the 13th and 14th centuries. The church's famous medieval wall paintings were most likely commissioned and painted in the mid-14th century based on the costumes of some of the figures and what is known about that time period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For first-timers, a trip to Taiwan isn’t complete without a hearty bowl of beef noodle soup. A dish unique to the island, it was invented in the mid-20th century by refugees who had left the Chinese mainland for Taiwan during the Chinese civil war. Today, it’s become somewhat of the national dish of Taiwan. But with over 10,000 dedicated beef noodle soup shops on the island, narrowing down the options is a harrowing task. 

Chef Hung Beef Noodle Soup is a great place to start. The eponymous owner Hung Ching-Lung is a five-time award-winning champion of the annual beef noodle soup competition in Taiwan—the most decorated winner in the event’s history. 

The restaurant’s menu offers a diverse overview of the beef noodle soup options on the island, from a classic star-anise-heavy broth flavored with spicy bean paste to a minimally seasoned clear broth where delicate slices of beef are highlighted. A couple of Hung’s award-winning bowls are on the menu as well: there’s one topped with tripe, tendon, and shank and another with medium rare, paper-thin slices of beef overlaid on top. 

For Chef Hung, beef noodle soup is much more than just a profession. It’s a passion. He has a cattle farm on the outlying island of Kinmen, where he raises his own cows for the restaurants. And he’s often tasked with training up-and-coming chefs on how to make a fantastic beef broth for their restaurants. He says the key is procuring a really high-quality cut of beef and making a flavorful broth. Everything else is just secondary.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The church of St. George the Martyr is the oldest Anglican church in Southeast Asia. Before the church was built, religious services in Penang were conducted at Fort Cornwallis and later at the courthouse in George Town, a short distance away. Plans for a church were submitted as early as 1810 but it wasn’t until the East India Company Act of 1813 gave the British East India Company authority that the church was built. It was constructed in 1818 and consecrated in 1819 costing some 60,000 Spanish dollars (also known as "pieces of eight").

The first significant event that took place in the church after its completion was the wedding of Governor William Edward Philips to Janet Bannerman, the daughter of his predecessor, Colonel John Alexander Bannerman on June 30, 1818.

On the grounds stands a memorial to Francis Light, a British explorer and the founder of the British colony of Penang and its capital city George Town in 1786. Interestingly, he is also the father of William Light, who founded the city of Adelaide in Australia.

The church was first restored after being looted and badly damaged during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia in the Second World War. It was restored again in 2011 after being designated a National Heritage in 2007.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This eclectic 80s erotica-themed bar fronted by a bright and loud neon sign is a celebration of vices. Inside: a cheeky diner awash in red lighting, analog phones, floral print diner chairs, plush banquettes, and a working disco ball in the corner. Keeping with the theme, the shelves are stocked with magazines crammed with centerfolds of busty, scantily clad women.  

The aesthetic of Pure Love is a nod to the “grandpa shops” of Taipei—old-school karaoke rooms where older men are known to seek the company and services of flirtatious waitresses. Big in the ‘60s and up to the ‘80s, they have since waned considerably in popularity after a crackdown in prostitution in the ‘90s.  

Pure Love Snack Bar is a modern revival of the grandpa shop, but without any of the shady or illegal dealings. The food is unpretentious and rooted in Taiwanese classics like braised pork over rice, oyster soup, fried chicken, and deep-fried noodles smothered in an earthy satay sauce. The drinks are more elevated and utilize locally available flavors like guava, tieguanyin tea, and mulberry.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked inside an old wooden building framed by a thick canopy of bright pink bougainvillea, Jinjiang Tea Room has been slinging out hearty dishes for over a decade. The term “tea house” is a misnomer; Jinjiang is a full-service restaurant dedicated to Hakka cuisine—the fare of a Han Chinese subgroup known for its emphasis on salty and smoked meats and a love of pickles. 

Situated in an 80-something-year-old house dating back to the Japanese colonial occupation of Taiwan, the restaurant is a quaint cottage in a forest of skyscrapers. The inside is just as charming, with outdated white ceiling tiles, wooden tables, and shelves stuffed with cute knick-knacks and miscellaneous clutter. 

The food is as wholesome as the decor. They do cold poached chicken—the skin crisp and gelatinous—served with a kumquat dipping sauce. There’s a lovely salted pork, sliced into bite-sized pieces, which pairs especially well with a hot bowl of short-grain rice dressed with soy  sauce-flavored lard.

The tender shoots of bird’s nest ferns are sauteed with the pickled seeds of a bird lime tree. There’s slippery noodles made with green tea, and thick belts of rice noodles with minced pork. Dessert is complimentary—usually a bowl of grass jelly, a mint-like herb beloved among the Hakka in Taiwan, or small mochi balls dressed with sweet ground peanuts. 

For the full experience, finish off with lei cha, a ground tea made with pounded grains. It’s akin to matcha, but less vegetal and more toasted and nutty.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some 1,000 years ago, the Normans pushed north attempting to subjugate part of Westmorland. As part of this effort, Castle Howe was built. Kendal’s undisputed first castle, Castle Howe, was built in 1092 and overlooks the town.

The fortifications consist of a well-defined motte, rising to around 33 feet and measuring around 59 feet in diameter at the summit. The base of the motte measures around 150 feet, and is surrounded by ditches and embankments. The bailey lays to the east of the motte, and is roughly triangular in shape, and was turned into a bowling green and is now a public park.

The Barony of Kendal fell at the hands of Ivo de Taillebois around 1092 and as a reward for his unfailing military support and success, Ivo was granted the Barony of Kentdale, a title that brought with it huge swathes of land in what is now Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria.

Kendal Castle, to the east of the earthworks, was probably built while Castle Howe was still being used. Likely, Castle Howe was the baronial center of Kirkland, and Kendal Castle was the baronial center of Kentdale. Castle Howe eventually became redundant, as did the Kendal Castle, and the administrative center of Kendal moved to the Moot Hall in the center of town.

In 1788, to celebrate the centenary of the revolution of 1688, an obelisk was erected on the summit of Castle Howe. The monument was designed by architect Francis Webster who was a native of Kendal.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This quiet neighborhood was once considered the future of urban living. The district of Hansaviertel was a rich urban neighborhood, and quite desirable thanks to its proximity to the city center while being right next to Tiergarten Park. But after the Second World War, it was almost completely leveled.

East Berlin had been rebuilding over the 50s, courtesy of its new socialist government and the West didn’t want to be left behind. To show that they were a new free and capitalist society, they also decided to rebuild, and the destroyed district of Hansaviertel proved to be an ideal location.

More than 50 architects were invited to work on the project, German and international alike. There were some famous names in the group, including Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer, the designer of the new Brazilian capital. Each presented their own future vision of housing.

The district contains a school, a kindergarten, a shopping center with a library and a theatre, and even an academy of arts. Additionally, every house has some special spin. They usually have descriptions on the ground floor somewhere, though a guide can be bought at the shopping center at a club made for this district]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world has seen many unique methods aimed at increasing road safety, from traffic control towers to roadside sentries. In Miyakojima, the local traffic safety association tried a slightly new way back in the 1990s, when five policemen-like figurines were set up at various crossings around the island. These were known as Mamoru-kun patrolmen. 

As the story goes, Mamoru-kun was born on August 5, 1991. He stands 180 centimeters tall, and his official titles are "Miyakojima Safety Association Staff" and "Miyakojima Police Transportation Division Officer."

Over the years there have been more figurines set up all over the island. Currently you can find 20 Mamoru-kun in various places in Miyakojima. Nineteen of these patrolmen are male, but at the Miyakojima Police Station, you can also find his female colleague Maruko-chan.

Thanks to their loyal service in all weather conditions, Mamoru-kun was also given a special Miyakojima residence permit by Mayor Toshihiko Shimoji in a ceremony back in 2012.

Originally these figurines were considered kimo (creepy), but recently Mamoru-kun have got their own fanbase. With their popularity rising, you can now also find Mamoru-kun cookies, soft drinks, and more.]]></summary>

But Tobita-kun, the name by which the children are commonly known, never actually makes it out onto the road. These “children” are, in fact, a style of wooden sign that for the last half-century has served as a warning to the nation’s drivers to watch for flesh-and-blood children who may unexpectedly dart into traffic, particularly in school zones. Often charmingly handmade by local councils, Tobita-kun has become an icon on Japan’s roadways—and played a role in revolutionizing road safety in the country.

Each female Genji firefly, Nipponoluciola cruciata, can lay up to 500 of the caviar-like orbs, carefully depositing them across the mossy banks of rivers and streams in blankets of pale yellow.

In the wild, only a tiny fraction of the eggs survive. River pollution, flood prevention measures, overfishing, and excess urban light devastated the insect’s population in the 20th century. But at the museum, artificial breeding and rearing methods will coax 30,000 Genji fireflies into larvae, a phase in which they live like tiny, voracious underwater explorers.

The Krakow Walk of Fame, or Aleja Gwiazd, as it is known in Polish has been a mainstay of the city since 2008, with the first person to obtain a star being Céline Dion. The walk was a joint venture between the city government and the radio station RMF FM, their goal is to honor outstanding musicians and bands from not only Poland but the world. 

Among the stars, visitors will find many locals from Poland, but also more internationally known names such as Michael Jackson, Benedict Cumberbatch, and even Elvis Presley.]]></summary>

A wide window looks out onto a picturesque, wooded area on the north side of Madison, Wisconsin—but it’s what’s inside that catches the eye. The modest apartment she shares with her husband John and two cats is full of framed art, photos, and other souvenirs from her travels across five continents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rather than driving through a tunnel beneath the Alps, this pass offers unparalleled views as you traverse over the mountains. The scenic route connects Val-Cenis in Western France with Susa in Italy, and was one of the most well-traveled paths through the Alps during the Middle Ages. The road will take a few hours to traverse, but the views and sights along the way are well worth it. 

Some scholars believe that this is the exact pass that Hannibal took with his army and war elephants in 218 BC. More than a millennia later, in 1414, Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara took this route back to Italy after meeting Charles VI in Paris. Niccolò described the pass as having "a good ascent and bad descent." Pilgrims have also taken this route on the way to Rome and the Vatican for centuries.

Eventually, Napoleon built a road on the old pilgrimage trail sometime in the early 19th century. In 1871, a railroad tunnel known as Frejus Tunnel was constructed some 30 miles away. The tunnel connected Mondane, France with Bardonecchia, Italy. It was one of the first tunnels of its kind and exhibited a remarkable feat of engineering for the time. Today, the tunnel is still one of the largest railroad tunnels in the world measuring some eight miles long. The road is also has been used as part of the Tour de France.

At the top of the pass, alongside an icy blue lake known as Lac du Mont Cenis, statues of Hannibal's elephants line the trail. The building of a dam created the artificial lake in 1921. The dam, today, feeds two hydroelectric power plants. The lake occasionally empties for maintenance. 

At the top of the pass, as you look out over the lake, you'll find a very quirky chapel. Built in 1967, the chapel is shaped like a pyramid and is made of concrete. Today it also houses a museum about the history of this region and is one of the highest museums in Europe. Other nearby sights include a botanical garden and multiple fortifications.]]></summary>

Located in his family's backyard, Linamnam (which means “delicious” in Tagalog) was opened in 2018 when Baldosano was still in his teens; fresh from competing on the TV show Junior MasterChef Pinoy Edition and a traineeship at Manila’s esteemed Toyo Eatery.

Linamnam opened its doors to the public in August 2018, offering a warm setting that puts the spotlight on the chef's bold dishes. The main dining room is a bahay kubo, a traditional thatched-roof, stilt house built on stilts typical to the Filipino lowland countryside. Built by Baldosano’s father, it offers an al fresco space adjacent to the chef‘s own childhood bedroom. …]]></summary>

Their models are sophisticated, and give a full spectrum in every direction from the surface patch. Thus we can integrate a set of patches into a surrogate combined spectrum for one rotating star covered in convecting patches. We discussed how we might do that, technically, and what projects we might then do with the output. What I want to do (yes, you guessed it) is build data-driven models of stellar granulation to improve radial-velocity surveys.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine Bagels, a family-owned establishment, has been delighting Berliners with their authentic New York-style bagels since 2013. Laurel Kratochvila’s bagel journey dates back to 1897 when her great-great grandfather, Hyman Cooper, declared that he was moving to New York City for one simple reason: “The bagels are better.” Although he ended up in Boston, running a fix-it shop, his declaration set the stage for four generations of bagel devotion within the family.

What began as a small addition to the English-language bookstore Shakespeare and Sons has become a destination in its own right. Laurel brought her family recipes to Berlin, recreating the authentic homemade bagels she missed from her New York roots. Her partner, Roman, who owns other bookstores in the Czech Republic and worked at the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, complements the culinary experience with an extensive collection of English and some French books.

Bagels are hand-rolled daily in small batches. Overnight proofing, rapid boiling, and hot baking process lend to an old-fashioned flavor across varieties from poppyseed to cinnamon raisin and rosemary sea salt. A variety of homemade schmears and toppings, including sandwich options with lox and whitefish salad, keeps the bagel game interesting for a dedicated legion of regular customers.]]></summary>

In 1974, the Mauritius kestrel—a photogenic bird with a speckled white breast and a vibrant red back and crown—came frighteningly close to extinction. Only four individuals remained. Thanks to decades of captive breeding on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the kestrel population climbed to 1,000 birds. Half a century later, as their numbers once again decline, another species is helping the charismatic raptors hang on: the traveler’s tree, a palmlike plant in the genus Ravenala.

But traveler’s trees are invasive to Mauritius and are causing problems for other native species in the ecosystem. Conservationists are now faced w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As cities grow, they tend to swallow and overtake smaller towns that were once situated well outside. Often this leads to a loss of the local identity, unless the former towns fight back. Weil am Rhein did this in a very creative way by building giant chairs.

The town is situated just over the German border, not far from Dreiländereck, where the borders of Germany, France, and Switzerland meet. It used to be completely separate from Basel, but as both cities grew, their borders started touching more and more, to the point where many people started thinking that Weil am Rhein was the German part of Basel.

People in Weil am Rhein disliked this and decided that they needed a new and separate identity from Basel. They decided that giant chairs were the key. Large chairs started appearing all over the town, not only on the ground but also on top of buildings. Most of them are made in a way that makes them climbable.

In the 1970s, a local artist and architect named Lassù burned chairs as an art form. He built a large concrete chair on top of a pyramid to allow for recurrent burnings.

Furniture is a big bar of the history of Weil am Rhein. The town is home to the headquarters of the Vitra Corporation, one of the largest manufacturers of designer furniture in Europe. The company operates the Vitra Design Museum, which explores the history of furniture and interior design. Its collection includes several historically significant chairs, including Eero Saarinen's Tulip Chair, Charles and Ray Eames' iconic Lounge Chair, and many more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Petroglyph Beach is a remarkable site located in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a scenic park that stretches across Arizona and Utah. Petroglyph Beach stands out as an archaeological treasure and offers visitors a glimpse into the rich history of the region.

Situated on the edge of the Colorado River, Petroglyph Beach is named for the numerous petroglyphs found etched into the walls of Glen Canyon. Petroglyphs are ancient rock carvings made by ancient Native Americans who inhabited the area centuries ago. These carvings depict various symbols, animals, and scenes that hold significant cultural and spiritual meaning.

The beach itself is a serene and tranquil spot where visitors can relax and enjoy the picturesque surroundings before continuing down the river.  Exploring Petroglyph Beach offers a unique opportunity to connect with the past and appreciate the artistic expressions of the indigenous people who once thrived in the region. The petroglyphs provide a glimpse into their daily lives, beliefs, and experiences. Visitors can spend hours examining the intricate carvings and pondering the stories they tell.

It's important to note that Petroglyph Beach is a protected site, and visitors are encouraged to treat it with respect and care. It is essential to avoid touching or damaging the petroglyphs to preserve them for future generations. Many sites within the National Park Service have specific guidelines and regulations in place to ensure their preservation, so it's advisable to follow any posted instructions.]]></summary>

I’ve always found it interesting how fictional food makes its way into the real world. A few years back, I wrote an article about how fantasy-novel food is a cuisine unto itself, and I still regret that I was abroad both times that Denny’s had an official Hobbit menu.
  A few weeks ago, I was reminded of the existence of another fictional culinary genre: anime food. Over the last few decades, Japanese animation and manga has had a huge influence on global fashion, film, music, and art. I would argue that it’s also familiarized people around the world with Japan’s popular and regional foods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Krakow is a very old city with many buildings whose construction goes back centuries. Many old utilities can still be found in and around such buildings, some of which have nearly been forgotten. A prime example of this is the so-called torch sockets.

These round holes that can be found near the entrance of several buildings in the old town confuse many people. Some think that they are some kind of umbrella stand, or maybe a place for cannon balls. However, their use is much more utilitarian. They were there to help put out torches before one would enter an enclosed and flammable building. 

The easiest to find an example of these sockets is the market hall entrance on the old square, where they line the main gate entrance. But many more examples can be found.]]></summary>

Slater grew up in Cocoa Beach and learned to surf all along the Space Coast.

Slater has won 11 world titles and is a point of pride in the Space Coast community. Slater is widely regarded as the greatest professional surfer of all time and holds 56 Championship Tour victories. Slater is also the oldest surfer still active in the World Surf League and won his eighth title at age 49.

However, the statue is located along a highway median, not at the beach. There is a lot of talk locally to move the statue to somewhere with a crosswalk. There is parking on either side in parking lots, but visitors have to cross a two-lane highway.]]></summary>

Shibam, the city known for the high concentration of high-rise mud buildings, is a mere 20 kilometers away. While Seiyun may not have the iconic status that its neighboring city enjoys, it is home to one of the largest mud buildings in the world: the Sultan Al Kathiri Palace (aka Seyun Palace). This seven-story palace boasts a total of 45 rooms. Under the white coating is a structure built according to ancient mud-building techniques. 

Although a much more ancient military structure existed on this site, the construction of the Sultan Al Kathiri Palace as it has survived into the 21st century was completed in the 1920s.

Mazes have existed for thousands of years and might be thought of as the very first puzzles in the world; based on the number of people who’ve likely solved them over the years, they might be the most popular form ever. So it is natural that many puzzle creators, including the readers of Puzzle Communication Nikoli, Japan’s influential, reader-driven puzzle magazine, would try to adapt them to the style of grid puzzle that the publication made famous.

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/kirkjugolf-basalt-columns-iceland"/>
        <updated>2023-07-21T23:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spread over 80 square meters and surrounded by meadows, Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns seem so out of place that for a long time, these columns were thought to have been the floor of a church that no longer exists. This belief was not completely implausible, considering that the first settlers on the island were probably Irish Hermits.  If this had been the case, they would most likely have built a church. These are all conjectures, but even if proven true, it is now clear that Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns was definitely not a human creation, but a natural one.

Like basalt columns elsewhere in the world, those in Kirkjugólf are the product of lava cooling. As lava cools, it contracts, and as it contracts, it cracks. The cracks start at the very bottom of the lava field and travel vertically to the top, a process that results in the creation of columns. Sharp contours and repetitive patterns make these sites seem like they were sculpted by a human hand.   

Descriptions of the Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns often report that they consist of hexagonal columns, but even this detail is misleading, for there is no shortage of pentagons, heptagons, and octagons. Yet, in spite of the variety of shapes (or more likely because of it), these columns fit in perfectly next to one another, leaving only a narrow, consistent gap between them.

Of note, the nearby village of Kirkjugólf was named after the basalt columns, and it literally means “the church floor.”  Following the discovery of its natural origins, the basalt columns were given the less-imaginative name of “Kirkjugólf Natural Monument.”]]></summary>

Twenty-seven years later, the ship was sunk during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawai'i, during World War II. Despite its relatively short career, the Arizona was present for several notable events and today the battleship is memorialized within the Capitol building of its namesake.

The Arizona spent World War I mostly in the United States, primarily used in training missions and only sailing across the Atlantic Ocean after the armistice ending the war had been signed. The Arizona was part of the convoy escorting President Woodrow Wilson to Europe for the Paris Peace Conference and later part of the fleet that escorted him back to the United St…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fairplay, Colorado started as a mining camp under the name of South Park City. In the 19th century, "park” was a common term in the Western United States for a wide valley, and Fairplay is located in South Park. (The animated sitcom is set in the same area.) Hence, this re-creation of a late 19th-century camp at the edge of modern Fairplay uses the original name. It consists of some 44 period buildings, seven of which are original. The rest were moved in from other old mining towns in the area. 

The buildings include mock-ups of businesses typical in a settlement like this, including a blacksmith shop, livery stable, hotel, dry goods store, drugstore, carpenter shop (which doubled as a funeral parlor), assay office, print shop, and so on. There are also living quarters, a church, a school, and even a mine and a locomotive. Contemporary equipment such as mining tools, carriages, and wagons are also extensively displayed.

Unpaved streets run between the buildings, some with authentic boardwalks, and you can wander around as much you wish. Sometimes exhibitions of 19th-century trades such as blacksmithing are also presented.]]></summary>

As I like to emphasize, you can't really average (or do any populations inferences with) a collection of labels delivered by a discriminative ML method run on a collection of objects. Think: Finding the mean age of a cluster, where each star in the cluster got an age estimate from a discriminative ML method trained on stars with known ages. This is because the discriminative ML methods output something very akin to posterior quantities, and if you average a bunch of posterior estimates, you are multiplying in a prior times itself many times; eventually the prior dominates the inference (in many cases).
Contardo's point: If what you want is a label for a collection of objects, like that mean age, you should train on . That is, make a training set where you have sets of N stars, labeled by mean age. Then this model can be applied to a new collection of stars and deliver a mean age estimate! Haha, brilliant. And correct. And consistent with the rules of inference.collections of objects]]></summary>

Third, Caerphilly is known as the birthplace of Tommy Cooper.

Tommy Cooper was born in 1921 in Caerphilly, but because the air in the town was so polluted at the time, Cooper’s family moved away when he was just three years old. While growing up, he developed an interest in magic and began to practice magic tricks regularly. Cooper reached adulthood right at the beginning of World War II, and he served in the Royal Horse Guards in the Middle East during the war. However, h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden River Cave is wonderful and unique because of the tremendous amount of history associated with it. John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, stopped by for a visit in 1867 and detailed his experience in his 1916 book Thousand Mile Walk To The Gulf. The cave was once a source of drinking water and hydroelectricity for the City of Horse Cave and the remnants of the equipment are still visible during the cave tour. 

Electricity generated from the cave stream powered the home above the cave, which included a dentist's office and two other buildings in town. Horse Cave was actually the first town in Kentucky to have incandescent lights. The cave operated for commercial tours from 1916-1943, until household waste from businesses and the community above polluted the cave streams.

The cave remained closed until 1992, when the combined efforts of local leaders and the nonprofit American Cave Conservation Association (ACCA) joined forces to clean up and restore the subterranean site. A regional sewage treatment system went online in 1989, which stopped pollution from entering the cave. This allowed nature to take its course and Hidden River Cave is now considered to be an environmental success story. The ACCA also opened the American Cave Museum in the entrance to the cave in 1992.

Today, tour guides explain Hidden River Cave’s history and general information about caves, the animals that inhabit them, and some of the uses of caves. This tour is not only entertaining, it is educational.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opened in December 2022, Babka & Krantz bears the distinction of being the only Jewish bakery in Berlin’s 750-year-old bakers' guild, or the Bäcker-Innung Berlin. Being accepted into the prestigious association is no easy feat. Certain standards for craftsmanship and quality, as well as a commitment to upholding traditional baking techniques, must be met by every bakery to be approved. Plus, Germany has stringent regulations for becoming a certified baker including formal education and vocational training.

The concept here revolves around a fusion of Eastern European and Israeli cuisines, with a focus on traditional Jewish pastries. Owners Marcin Liera-Elkin and Shahar Elkin dole out their favorite sweet and savory pastries, including two versions of braided bread inspiring the shop’s name: babka baked according to Marcin’s Polish grandmother recipe, as well as krantz from Shahar’s homeland Israel.

Over 90 percent of the baked goods are made using organic ingredients, and the house-made yeast dough is allowed to rest for up to 48 hours. The bakery's warm and inviting atmosphere, coupled with delectable offerings, has made it a popular haven in the capital’s up-and-coming Friedenau neighborhood. It’s the perfect place to spend a couple of hours sipping coffee and savoring a sweet hazelnut babka with creamy nougat cream or a savory Sabich bagel, seasoned with zaatar and topped with aubergine and hummus, are definite favorites.

The inclusion of Babka & Krantz as the first Jewish bakery in the guild is a remarkable milestone, highlighting the evolving nature of Berlin's gastronomic landscape and the celebration of diverse cultural influences within the city's vibrant food scene. The bakery has become an integral part of Berlin’s steadily growing Jewish community, particularly among Israeli expats (by some figures, more than 10,000 have moved to Berlin in the last decade). It's a testament to the power of good food and the importance of preserving culinary traditions for future generations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Southern Utah has spectacular scenery, but for pioneers trying to carry out agriculture in these arid lands an adequate water supply was an ongoing problem.

This led to some extraordinary water diversion projects, including the Tropic Ditch. Water was diverted from the East Fork of the Sevier River, atop the Paunsaugunt Plateau west of the present location of Bryce Canyon National Park, to Bryce Valley. Construction began in 1890 and the Ditch was completed in 1892. It was built entirely with muscle power, using hand tools and draft animals. It extends easterly some 10 miles to the town of Tropic, which relies on its water to this day.

To minimize excavation, a critical consideration with no earth-moving equipment, natural watercourses were used as much as possible. In particular, an ordinarily dry east-draining watercourse, now called Water Canyon, became a major part of the ditch. Water Canyon crosses what is now Bryce Canyon National Park, but is still in use as it was grandfathered in when the Park was created.]]></summary>

I've been playing soccer my whole life. I played competitively from when I was seven years old until I graduated high school. Mostly, though, I just remember being bad at it. I remember I played for the brown or blue team, and we were the worst team. I always wanted to be on the black team. The black team was really good and I was never allowed on it.

But then, in middle school, that all changed. I still wasn’t the best soccer player, but I became obsessed with the game. More specifically, I became obsessed with London’s Chelsea Football Club.

An Exclusive Look at the Los Alamos Lab Where Oppenheimer Created the Bomb

by Jennie Rothenberg Gritz, Smithsonian Magazine

Los Alamos, New Mexico, is still an active national laboratory, and the sites where Manhattan Project scientists developed the first nuclear weapon remain off limits to the public. But photographer Minesh Bacrania, a physicist who worked in the lab’s nonproliferation division from 2006 to 2012, received special permission to take photographs for Smithsonian Magazine, providing a never-before-seen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loupin' Stanes is a stone circle sat on a low platform above the River Esk. The rough stone circle has two large stones marking the entrance at the southwest side. The rest of the stone circle is made up of 10 stones.

There are also stones scattered around the exterior of the stone circle, their role in the site is uncertain. Further along, the Esk are the remains of another stone circle, Girdle Stanes. Girdle Stanes was once made up of 40 or 45 stones, over time, the Esk has changed course and it swept away part of the stone circle. Around 21 stones remain in place, one precariously balanced beyond the fence on the edge of the river bank.

It's thought that the entrance would have been located on the southeast side. The proximity of the two circles is unusual. Questions remain about why two such different style circles were built so close together. It's uncertain which was built first, although one belief is that Loupin' Stanes was built to replace Girdle Stanes after it was damaged.

There are also two recumbent stones between the two stone circles. Questions also remain about their purpose, were they some way of connecting the damaged stone circle with the smaller circle.]]></summary>

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”]]></title>

What is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? 

One is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. 

Similarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.]]></title>

(2) ideological ID is not policy prefs — bet that looks more liberal for HS boys
