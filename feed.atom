Though its name simply means “scented candle” in Thai, this double-wicked curl of beeswax is no ordinary room freshener. Tian op is a flavoring agent, or rather, a scenting agent, used to enhance specific dishes in Thai cuisine.

Chefs light the U-shaped candle at both ends, place it on top of the food to be scented, and cover it with a lid. Lack of oxygen snuffs the flames and the enclosed space fills with flowery smoke. Minutes or even hours later, the chefs lift the lid and serve the food, now garnished with the candle’s delectable aroma.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Darlingtonia Trail is named for the bog that it snakes around, filled with Darlingtonia californica, carnivorous pitcher plants. Called the cobra lily because their shape resembles an upright cobra, these plants lie in wait to strike at insects, their main source of nitrogen.  

At the first platform on the trail, you can see the bog in full bloom. At peak season, its full of hundreds of these gorgeous pitcher plants, some with bright flowers growing out. A few miles from the bog, the Smith River churns along. The area is full of a mineral called serpentine, which is gray-green in color and gives the Smith its brilliant blue-green color. The weathering of the serpentine produces magnesium, silica, and iron in the soil. It reduces the levels of calcium, potassium, and aluminum. To get the nitrogen and phosphorus that the plants need, they turn to a different source:  insects. 

The pitcher plants have evolved to secrete nectar that attracts flies, ants, spiders, beetles, butterflies, and moths. They enter the plant and slide down into its long trumpet-shaped gullet, full of downward-facing hairs and slippery wall, becoming trapped at the bottom. There, the insect drowns and is slowly consumed by the plant. This is an extremely beautiful but extremely metal plant. 

Speaking of metal, the area was extensively mined during and after the California Gold Rush. On the trail, you can also see a test mine shaft, probably dug to test for suitable minerals and metals to dig. They must not have found anything here, but the area has produced gold, chromite, and copper.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty have been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2009. Built to honor the ancestors and to assert their royal authority, many of the tombs consist of a huge burial mound and several temples.

Scattered over 18 locations across the Korean Peninsula, it’s not easy to see everything in one go, but one location has a huge cluster of royal tombs. Located in the city of Guri, right outside the perimeters of Seoul, is Donggureung: The Nine Eastern Royal Tombs.

The largest royal burial site in South Korea, Donggureung (also transliterated as Dongguneung) is home to the resting places of 17 kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty, originally founded by the order of King Taejong in 1408.

The “nine tombs” consist of Geonwonneung (King Taejo, 1408); Hyeonneung (King Munjong and Queen Hyeondeok, 1452); Mongneung (King Seonjo and Queens Uiin and Inmok, 1600); Sungneung (King Hyeonjong and Queen Myeongseong, 1674); Hwineung (Queen Jangnyeol, 1688); Hyeneung (Queen Danui, 1718); Wonneung (King Yeongjo and Queen Jeongsun, 1776); Gyeongneung (King Heonjong and Queens Hyohyeon and Hyojeong, 1849); and Suneung (King Ikjong and Queen Sinjeong, 1890).

In addition to these royal tombs, with their red pavilions, burial mounds, and funerary statues, the Donggureung complex also contains Myeongbinmyo (the grave of King Taejong’s concubine), the caretaker’s house, and a small museum. Surrounded by a serene forest and typically not as crowded as other historic attractions in and near Seoul, it’s quite a lovely place; one major shortcoming, perhaps, is that you can’t get close to the main parts of the tombs, as all the mounds are fenced at the foot.]]></summary>

Separated from Oman proper by the United Arab Emirates, the Musandam Peninsula reaches toward Iran and into the notorious Strait of Hormuz with delicate, dramatic mountains of barren red rock falling into an emerald sea.

These are the only desert fjords in the world.

Known locally as khors, these jagged coves were created by the collision of tectonic plates instead of the glacial activity that shaped their Nordic and Alaskan cousins. But the uncanny similarities still persist with 6,500-foot (2,000-meter) mountains and razor-thin spines of rock towering over deep water teeming with wildlife. Dolphins, rays, and a variety of colorful reef fish can be found throughout the inlets, and the warm, clear water makes for excellent scuba diving and snorkeling.

Easily explored in a day trip from the town of Kasab, most excursions will be aboard a traditional fishing vessel known as a dhow. Between vibrant local history lessons and fascinating facts of geography, guides may even free dive for scallops freshly served as ceviche with a bit of lemon and spices.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[San Diego is California's second-largest city by population and is proudly referred to as "America's Finest City." It has a reputation for being in close proximity to Mexico and home to all branches of the United States armed forces. However, it is perhaps most well known for its 70 miles of beaches. 

Unless an avid and practiced sea diver, few visitors probably have little experience or knowledge of what is living in these watery depths. This is what makes the Map of the Grand Canyons La Jolla Shores so unique. Unveiled in October 2020, this 2,200 square-foot LithoMosaic not only depicts over 100 variety of species, (including aquatic varieties, as well as birds, mammals, and reptiles) but also the geological formations that can be found in and around this beachfront property.

The map was created to honor what would have been Walter Munk's 103rd birthday. Munk was an Austrian-born oceanographer who worked at the nearby Scripps Institute of Oceanography, as well as being a resident of La Jolla Shores. He was an avid proponent of understanding the effects climate change has on our environment, including the impacts on ocean temperatures. 

Along with the Walter Munk Foundation for the Oceans, artist Robin Brailsford and her team of volunteers spent hundreds of hours mapping out and creating the massive display. Visitors are encouraged to walk on the art piece and discover the intricate details, as well as gain an understanding of what is taking place under the nearby waves. This includes 3-D models of reefs and the varying shades of blue tiles to indicate the various depths of the ocean floor.]]></summary>

She was unable to move, and according to stories, the only object that she enjoyed was a tall dollhouse with clear windows that her father George had built for her. When Lova passed in 1908, she was buried and the dollhouse went with her to the grave, or so the story is told.

Some news articles speculate the dollhouse was built specifically for the grave, which was not an entirely uncommon style for the region. Regardless, Lova’s father had requested the dollhouse be destroyed at the death of himself and Lova’s mother but the community rallied to disinter Lova and move the dollhouse to where she is now buried with her parents.]]></summary>

Created by American sculptor Henry L. Norton and erected in 1925 by the Rhode Island Red Club, the memorial commemorates “the birthplace of the Rhode Island Red breed of fowl which originated near this location.” The poultry breed became integral to the area’s agrarian economy during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 2001, the monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1854, William Tripp, a local farmer, began experimenting with poultry breeding.  He acquired exotic fowl brought back from Asia on New Bedford whaling ships. The Asian …]]></summary>

Maybe it is me, but if you give me a complex function where the dependence on a variable is distributed in several sub-functions, I am very likely to find N different results if I do it N times. Yes, I am 57 years old, and I should be handling other things and leave these calculations to younger lads, I agree. <br/><br/><p><a href="https://www.science20.com/tommaso_dorigo/automatic_differentiation_derivgrind-256735" target="_blank">read more</a></p></div></div>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Extraterrestrial Highway, also known as Nevada State Route 375, cuts through nearly a hundred miles of lonely desert and borders the mysterious military base known as Area 51. The road has become a pilgrimage for those in search of signs of government conspiracies and life from other solar systems. But those who traverse this desolate land looking for aliens will miss the wonderful weirdness of its otherworldly geology, millennia-long human history, and uniquely adapted species. It’s worth seeking out close encounters with the terrestrial oddities and wild wonders of Route 375.

The most decadent substance on Earth, to me, is brown-sugar crème brûlée boba. My favorite version contains brown-sugar syrup drizzled into milk, a thick layer of milk foam with crispy broiled caramel on top, chunks of flan studded throughout, and, at the very bottom, a scoop of warm boba pearls.
  Soft, chewy, and perfectly pearl-shaped, tapioca-based boba originated in 1980s Taiwan, and has since spread around the world, usually at the bottom of a cup of sweetened iced tea. You could write a whole dictionary of boba terminology: Both the tapioca balls and the drink itself can be referred to as boba. Not only that, but boba also goes by a number of other names: …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The unassuming canteen attached to the long-standing Indian YMCA mouthwatering dishes are on display from self-serve, all-you-can-eat buffet trays showcasing local dishes from across India’s culinarily diverse 29 states. The affordable prices (ranging from just £6.50 for breakfast to £13 for lunch and dinner), make it as much of a favorite among local office workers as the students lodging there. 

Favorites among patrons include chicken korma and biryani, while Thursdays are dedicated to South Indian dishes like sambar, a spicy lentil soup. Freshly prepared home-style curries (the Kerala fish curry, egg curry and butter chicken are popular options), tandooris, onion bhajis, and dhal offer a filling feast for the senses. Rice and condiments, as well as drinks such as coffee and Chaas, a refreshing herb-infused yogurt drink, are complimentary.

The canteen, located on the building’s ground-floor Mahatma Gandhi Hall, is a central hidden gem for many Londoners, situated near Fitzroy Square and just a three-minute walk from Warren Street Station. Established in 1920, the hostel is a hub for the young Indian diaspora community in London, and offers a rich culinary and cultural space for British Indian history. Thanks to the communal dining hall setup, where tables are often shared between groups of strangers, conversations with new folks are common, lending to a comfortable, almost family-like atmosphere. 

While YMCAs are historically Christian institutions, the Indian YMCA prides itself on being an interfaith organization that embraces and celebrates all communities. Residents and visitors alike appreciate the inclusive environment where shared experiences warmly bring people together—regardless of religion, language or cultural heritage.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tea is said to have originated in China about 2,700 years ago. It was brought to Japan by a mission of monks returning from Tang, and its earliest cultivation was in 1191, when the Buddhist priest Myōan Eisai sewed tea seeds in the Iwakamibō gardens of Ryōzen-ji Temple, Saga, not far from the ancient settlement of Yoshinogari.

Initially meant to be a medicinal plant, Japanese tea soon evolved into its own kind, with a culture of tea ceremonies developing over the years. Eisai's tea became what is known as matcha today. It was widely appreciated by Buddhists practicing zen, as they believed it improved one's body and spirit.

On the grounds of Shōfuku-ji Temple in Fukuoka, the oldest zen temple in Japan originally established by Eisai himself, stands a direct descendant of his tea trees, known as the "Japan's First Tea Tree." A small, nondescript tree with lean branches at first glance, it may not be anything extraordinary, but its influence on traditional Japanese culture is irreplaceable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking through narrow, winding alleys of the Noryangjin district of Seoul, you may be reminded of gritty scenes from the Bong Joon-Ho film Parasite, a milestone in Korean cinema that took the 2020 Oscars by storm.

While much of the filming took place at several locations in Seoul, the neighborhood is not especially featured in the film—except for a small, unassuming pizzeria called Sky Pizza. It’s nothing out of the ordinary, just a run-of-the-mill place with the usual menu. But on its façade and interior are autographs of Bong Joon-Ho, as well as the logo and delivery boxes of the fictional “Pizza Generation” restaurant from the film.

Parasite follows the tragicomedic lives of the poverty-stricken Kim family as they struggle to make ends meet, each member gradually infiltrating into the wealthier Park family, only for chaos to ensue. In one of the numerous low-income side jobs that the Kim family takes up, they fold delivery boxes for a local eatery: Pizza Generation. Later, the pizza place makes another appearance where the Kims are seen scheming on how to kick the housemaid out of the Park household.

In real life, Sky Pizza is a quiet family-run pizza joint. The owner will proudly offer visiting cinephiles the chance to take pictures with the Pizza Generation boxes, and bring you sketchbooks full of signatures and messages from Parasite-loving visitors from around the world, so that you can leave your own mark as well. Flipping through these pages, you'll see what a huge influence the film has had on a small local business like Sky Pizza.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Polk Theatre is a historical landmark that has been a central entertainment hub for nearly 100 years. Designed in 1928, the theatre has survived hurricanes, fires, and even a near-demolition in the 1970s. But thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Lakeland community, the Polk Theatre was saved and continues to stand today as a testament to the city's love for the arts.

Walking into the Polk Theatre is like stepping back in time. The art deco style of the building immediately transports visitors to a different era. The bright neon lights and intricate ceiling details make anyone feel like a movie star. And speaking of movies, the Polk Theatre has been showing them for almost a century— from silent films to talkies to new releases, the theatre has seen it all.

But movies aren't the only form of entertainment at the Polk Theatre. The venue also hosts live performances, ranging from plays to musical acts and symphony concerts. The acoustics in the theatre are second to none.

The Polk Theatre is not just a building made of bricks, but it is a place of great emotional significance to many. It is a cultural icon that has withstood the test of time and has been a source of joy for generations. All in all, the Polk Theatre is a cornerstone of Lakeland's culture and a testament to the city's love of the arts. Whether you're watching a classic movie, attending a live performance, or a guest at a private event, the Polk Theatre is the place to be.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vientiane, the capital of Laos, is home to many Buddhist temples and monasteries. With its foundation dating back to 1563 during the Lan Xang period, Wat Si Muang is one of the oldest and best-known temples here, most popular among locals.

In the past, Wat Si Muang was once associated with royal rituals, sometimes hosting coronation ceremonies. The popular myth claims that it was named after a local pregnant woman, Si, who sacrificed her own life to call upon an ancient guardian spirit to protect the city from an oncoming flood.

Another version of the story, perhaps resulting from mistranslation, has it that multiple pregnant women were sacrificed to prevent evil spirits from causing a disaster. Either way, the mythical Si Muang continues to be remembered and honored as a hero.

The temple itself houses a copy of the Emerald Buddha statue and a sacred stone pillar called the Lák Méuang, an ancient monument believed to enshrine the guardian spirit of the city, as well as several mini-shrines throughout the premises, some gorgeously kitsch. Right outside the temple also stands an imposing statue of King Sisavangvong, the first ruler of the Kingdom of Laos.]]></summary>

High winds tore at Gothic Mountain as the sleeping giant watched over the cabins nestled in Gothic, Colorado, a remote outpost accessible only by skis during the valley’s harsh alpine winters. The plumes of snow that lifted from the peak briefly appeared to form a cloud and then disappeared.

To many, the snow that seemed to vanish into thin air would go unnoticed. But in a region where water availability has slowly begun to diminish, every snowflake counts. Each winter, an unknown percentage of the Rocky Mountain West’s snowpack disappears into the atmosphere, as it was doing on Gothic Mountain, just outside the ski resort town of Crested Butte.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Barbeque, or siu mei, is a crucial part of Cantonese cuisine, and Hong Kong is full of shops and restaurants that excel at it. Everyone has their favorite, and for a lot of siu mei aficionados, that’s Sun Kwai Heung, a humble little take-out spot in the far eastern reaches of Hong Kong island. 

Everything is made on-site, from crispy-skinned roast pork to soy sauce chicken, to char siu, barbecued pork butt that is dipped in a gloriously sticky maltose glaze. The latter, in particular, is their specialty, and it’s not surprising to find a queue spilling out onto the sidewalk at certain hours of the day when it’s due to come out of the oven. 

You can customize your order by letting the staff know how fatty you’d like the char siu to be – if you’re unsure, boon fei sau, which means “half-lean half-fat,” is a good place to start. Char siu—or any Cantonese barbecue, in fact—can be enjoyed on its own as a snack or appetizer, like charcuterie, or pair it with plain rice to make it a proper meal.]]></summary>

Not to say that this low-fi hangout doesn’t make a proper drink—it just does so without taking itself too seriously. It’s one of the few places you’ll find cocktails made with Chinese liquors, from the traditional rice-based Yuk Bing Siu, to Magnolia, a recent local invention featuring Chinese medicinal herbs.

If you’re not in the mood for cocktails, there’s an excellent rotation of craft beers, both imported and local, on tap, bottled, or canned, as well as mocktails, and a neat menu of Asian-inspired dishes, from Okinawan taco rice to Sichuan fried chicken. Stop by any time of day (they also do great coffees)—it’s the kind of place where anything goes and you certainly wouldn’t be judged for day-drinking.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many of Hong Kong’s dai pai dongs (street stalls) have either closed down or moved indoors over the years, and fortunately for congee lovers, Mui Kee belongs in the latter category. Opened in 1979 as a street stall, and now located on the top floor of a wet market, Mui Kee specializes in fish broth-based congee.

Toppings are cooked to order, and each serving of congee is finished off in a copper pot on extremely high heat, in a manner similar to stir-frying in a wok. Congee purveyors using this technique are few and far between these days, making them a rare gem—little wonder that the stall is busy even in summer, despite the lack of air conditioning. 

Fresh fish belly is a specialty here, but you’ll find all the classic toppings like pork meatballs, sliced beef, pork innards. and century egg, as well as essential side dishes like savory Chinese doughnuts and steamed rice rolls.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Hong Kong-style egg tart, with its jiggly custard center and just-baked pastry crust, sits proudly on almost every local bakery's shelves, and has done so for the better half of the past century. So for a Swiss-Frenchman to change up the recipe, and make his version an absolute hit that has queues round the block with tourists and locals alike, is no mean feat. 

This baker, Grégoire Michaud, cut his teeth in the pastry kitchens of five-star hotels, and when he launched his own brick-and-mortar, Bakehouse, he wanted to pay tribute to the city he's called home for the past couple of decades by creating his spin on this local favorite. 

His egg tart has a flaky laminated sourdough base; its center meltingly creamy, and intensely eggy, but it’s not the only thing you should get—the pretzel croissant is satisfyingly chewy, sprinkled with just the right amount of salt, and the beef rendang pie will make your palate sing. Keep an eye out for one-off seasonal specials.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Established in 1930 on a plot of 200 acres in Lloyd Harbor on Long Island, the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception trained future clergy members in the Diocese of Rockville Center, including Nassau and Suffolk counties, for 82 years, until the educational programming relocated to Yonkers in 2012. But before the land was purchased by the diocese in 1924, it was owned by Ronald Roy Conklin, a descendant of the original colonizers of Huntington and the owner of the North American Trust Company, which grew from a successful real estate partnership.

Conklin and his wife, the famous opera singer Mary McFadden, settled on what was then known as Rosemary Farm in 1913, living in a 30-room mansion overlooking Lloyd Harbor. Perhaps more fascinating though, is a treasure that lies just beyond the ruins of the home—an outdoor amphitheater built as a gift for McFadden.

Designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, of Central Park and Prospect Park fame, it hosted the National Red Cross Pageant in 1917, drawing thousands of guests and featuring a march led by John Philip Sousa. The amphitheater had an unusual design, with a moat in the center separating the audience and the performers on stage—quite the way to handle pesky hecklers!

When the property was purchased by the diocese, the amphitheater fell into disuse, but has since been restored by the folks at the seminary. Few venture beyond the main building to explore the wonders in the backyard.]]></summary>

A much stronger brew than the British original, nai cha, as Hong Kong-style milk tea is known, is made of Ceylon tea and unsweetened evaporated milk, which became widely available after the Second World War. 

These days, it’s found everywhere from fast food restaurants to cha chaan tengs (diners serving localized Western food). Despite being the default caffeine hit of the city’s denizens, surprisingly few places have made the drink their focus. 

My Cup of Tea isn’t devoid of food (there’s a small menu of cha chaan teng classics like fluffy white bread omelet sandwiches), but it’s first and foremost a tea bar, insisting on making their own blend of tea, and putting the brewing station front and center of the diminutive shop. They even host milk tea-making workshops, believing that the beverage isn’t just sustenance, but an important part of the city’s culture and history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During construction works of the new Royal Collections Gallery, a set of ancient ruins was found. They include a section of the oldest Muslim wall, including several remains of houses attached and a pillar, part of the original gate of that primitive Madrid.

The wall was built in the late 9th century and made of large limestone ashlars, similar in technique to the nearby Tower of Bones and the Arab Wall. However, the remains found here are even older. Among these vestiges, it has been interpreted that a door of three meters (almost 10 feet) would correspond to that first gate of Madrid, the Puerta de la Sagra, (Xagra, in Arabic) very similar to the Puerta de Alcántara in Toledo. 

All of these elements are linked to the origins of the foundation of Madrid by the Umayyad emir Muhammad I, in which the existence of a fortress in this place was justified because of its location. It bordered the Christian kingdoms of the north and sat on a high plateau protected by cliffs. 

After being hidden for centuries, the ruins have been incorporated into the permanent collection of the new museum and can be seen through a large glass. A video is projected in an adjoining room where the archaeological site is always in sight. The different parts of the old wall are illuminated. The exhibit shows the evolution of that ancient walled enclosure, first Muslim and then Christian, as well as the construction of the old Alcazar from the Habsburg dynasty to the current Royal Palace built on the Versailles style by the Bourbons in the 18th century.]]></summary>

Along an inner road, a short distance away from St. Paul's Church near Pune Railway Station, in the center of the city, there is an empty patch of land along the side. In the corner of the plot are a number of interesting ancient stone structures. As one observes keenly, they are revealed to be old tombs. 

According to sources, these are European tombs from the 19th century. Historians, archaeologists, and other experts have studied them and have arrived at a number of possibilities regarding their origin and details. Some say these belonged to German soldiers from around 1850, while others are of the opinion that they date back to around 1817 and are of French soldiers who were said to be a part of the Peshwa Army. 

One of the tombs is dome-shaped, supported with stone pillars. According to experts, it belonged to the wife of a French soldier. Along with soldiers, some of the tombs are also said to be those of local Europeans of that era. However, due to the withering of the plaques, it is difficult to ascertain the exact details with any degree of certainty. 

One of the tombs has a tree growing vertically out of the stone slab. Another one has mysterious circular symbols carved over its sides. Then there is one which is completely covered with creepers while another has a gnarled tree trunk resting at an angle over its top. Since this place is along an inner road, not many people know of its existence, despite it being located in the center of the city. 

It is a fascinating spot to explore on a weekend and thus discover this lesser-known side of the city’s history, particularly for people who have a penchant for mysteries.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coimbra is one of the oldest cities in Portugal. Home to the most prestigious university in the country, it served as the first capital of the Kingdom of Portugal and has had a strong monastic presence ever since. Across the river from the main part of town stands the ruined Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha. Originally founded by Lady Mor in the late 13th century, it became a favorite of Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, who built her palace next door.

The monastery operated until the early 17th century, when flooding from the Mondego River forced the nuns to move uphill and leave the monastery. And there it sat for 300 years, until it was excavated in the late 20th century.

Santa Clara-a-Velha is most famous for being the execution site for Ines de Castro. In 1340, King Afonso IV arranged the marriage between his son Pedro and Constanza Manuel of Castille. Much to Afonso's displeasure, Pedro fell madly in love with Constanza's cousin Ines, and installed her in Coimbra as his mistress. Constanza gave birth to a son and heir to the throne, but after she died in 1349, Pedro refused to marry any other woman except Ines.

Fearing her influence on Pedro and any future sons they might have, in 1355 Afonso had Ines murdered in the Santa Clara-a-Velha monastery. Pedro had her killers brutally executed, and when Afonso died and Pedro became king, the legend goes that he had Ines' body exhumed and coronated as Queen.

Today, Pedro and Ines are buried together in nearby Alcobaca, but their story has become one of the most well-known tragedies in Portuguese history. As for the monastery itself, it still experiences flooding every now and then, but visitors are now able to access the lower floors of the old monastery, including the choir and old treasury. Santa Clara-a-Velha remains one of the most complete and historically important Gothic ruins in the entire country.]]></summary>

Following the first act, a crew member raised a lit chandelier catching fire to the oil-painted hemp backgrounds. The fire spread quickly through the poorly designed theater, which was built to hold no more than 500 people.

Despite the heroic attempts of an enslaved man named Gilbert Hunt and other brave guests, 72 people including acting governor George Smith perished in the nearly 1,000-degree Fahrenheit flames, reducing the once great theater to ash and rubble.

In 1814, the Monumental Church was built to memorialize those who perished during the great fire. In front of the church rests an urn, inscribed with the victims' names. Underneath the church lays a crypt in which the victims.]]></summary>

The Appalachian Trail Keeps Getting Longer

by Lizzie Johnson and Lauren Tierney, Washington Post

When it was completed in 1937, the Appalachian Trail stretched 2,050 miles from Georgia to Maine. Today, it is almost 2,200 miles. The Washington Post has mapped the most substantial of the thousands of route changes—and the highway construction, exhausted hikers, and bad smells behind them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Riviera Ballroom, built in 1933, was a regional destination for live music from its opening until the early 1980s. The ballroom was the site of numerous performers that included Glenn Miller, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington among many others.

Singers of the era that performed there included Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Mel Torme, the Andrew Sisters, Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day, Perry Como, Billie Holiday, and Lena Horne to name just a few.   

In 1972, the Riviera Ballroom was turned into a privately-operated nightclub called “Top Deck” which operated until the early 1980s. Artists who performed at Top Deck included Donna Summer, Chubby Checker, Herman’s Hermits, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, Gloria Gaynor, Chaka Khan, the Village People, and Cheap Trick, among others.

A more complete list of the performers is listed on the wall on the 1st floor of the Riviera building (which is open to the public and has several small shops open from spring to fall).

The ballroom recently underwent an extensive renovation and now is a popular venue for weddings and other private, special events. While usually not open to walk-through, the inside is clearly visible from the exterior windows on the second-floor landing.]]></summary>

Even though x is one of the least-used letters in the English alphabet, it appears throughout American culture—from Stan Lee’s X-Men superheroes to “The X-Files” TV series. The letter x often symbolizes something unknown, with an air of mystery that can be appealing—just look at Elon Musk with SpaceX, Tesla’s Model X, and now X as a new name for Twitter.

You might be most familiar with x from math class. Many algebra problems use x as a variable, to stand in for an unknown quantity. But why is x the letter chosen for this role? When and where did this convention begin?

There are a few different explanations that math enthusiasts have put forward—some citing translation, others…]]></summary>

This chewy, taffy-like treat is emblematic of the local terroir, featuring Provence’s lavender honey and sweet almonds. While nougat can be found anywhere from Marseille to Avignon, Montélimar, located about halfway between Lyon and the Mediterranean coast, has been a cradle for the confection for centuries—and the presence of nougatiers on the Nationale was a distinctly Montélimar phenomenon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore a South Florida 1960s relic that’s as in flux as the beachfront tides themselves. Every day at the Swap Shop is something new, with kitschy interiors and mysterious vendors that are always changing.

Swap Shop is the perfect combination of mass-produced discount grime, liminal spaces, garage sales, and a perpetually creaky carnival. From ever-churning children’s rides to DIY robot statues, old movie promotional items, grillz makers, indoor go-karts, arcade machines, and flower shops, Swap Shop has it all. You can visit just to take in the nonsensical decorations or to try your luck shopping.

If it exists, it exists at the Swap Shop in its most discounted, off-brand form. You can buy adult DVDs from a white windowless van and pick up themed tourist mugs just a few footsteps away.

On weekends, visitors are treated to paid parking across the street with a bright yellow pedestrian bridge to safely usher them into the world of dust, rust, and mystery. The bridge has its own strange statues that help set the tone. Weekdays are calmer, allowing visitors to park closer to the building.

Discounted flea market finds await at every corner. And for the empty stalls, relics of old movie promotional posters, dusty homemade decorations, and strange dioramas keep things entertaining. There are two floors of indoor booths plus semi-permanent outdoor container booths and an ever-changing lineup of cars selling their wares in the drive-in theater’s wavy parking lot.

Speaking of cars, the building also seems to inexplicably host a collection of flashy collectible cars—though it has dwindled in size in recent years.

Added bonus: Steve-O used to be a clown here before the TV show Jackass made it big.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Constructed in the early 12th century as a rural sanctuary far from the perils of war, Llanthony Priory continues to offer visitors a retreat from the pitfalls of modern life, even if the building itself hasn’t stood the test of time.

The grand abbey was founded by Norman knight William de Lacy, who—in a highly unconventional move for the time—traded the battlefield for religion, and created a hermitage in the shadows of Brecon’s Black Mountains.

During the height of its popularity, up to 40 religious canons lived on-site at the abbey and visitors travelled to see it from around the world. Sadly this period of prosperity did not last. Following Henry VIII's set of 16th-century laws that worked to dissolve British monasteries, the site was largely abandoned and left to the elements.

And yet, even as a ruin, the Monmouthshire site exudes a tranquil beauty befitting a monument that was once one of Wales’ great medieval buildings. Symmetrical stone arches still stand in a grand row, along with a few turret-topped stone towers, providing a sense of the scale of the original priory. So picturesque are the weathered remains that famed British artist J.M.W. Turner traveled here to paint them in 1794 (a watercolor that now hangs in the Tate Britain in London).

And then, of course, there’s the pub. Hidden beneath the 900-year-old site, in what is thought to have once been the abbey’s cellar, is a wonderfully cozy undercroft bar, where in-the-know patrons duck down into a cave-like space to sample the selection of local ales on tap.

The old-worldly drinking den is run by the Llanthony Priory Hotel, which is attached to the site. The hotel has been set up to retain a sense of the abbey’s original role as a retreat from the modern world, and, as such, offers no in-room TVs, no wifi, and not even any mobile phone signal.

Along with drawing hikers, history buffs, and quirky pub enthusiasts, the area is also famed for its stargazing credentials, offering exceptionally clear views of the cosmos after dark.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Italianate-style storefront on the corner of Palm and Chorro Streets in San Luis Obispo, California, originally functioned as the retail establishment and residence of Ah Louis, a prominent Chinese-American entrepreneur, banker, and labor organizer. He was the de facto leader of the local community and is credited with significant contributions to regional commerce, agriculture, and industry. Established in 1874, the first floor of the building served as a counting house, post office, gathering place, pharmacy, and general store, trading in all manner of goods, including rum and opium; and it was the nucleus of Chinatown. The upper floor was the residence of Ah Louis and his family, including his eight children, from 1885 to 1936.

Visitors can walk or drive up the winding, sun-soaked streets of this sub-alpine, Italian town to reach a natural promenade overlooking the Brenner Valley—home to the world's largest free-swinging bell. Guests can stand beneath it in awe of its size, or at sunset. 

The bell is more than a novelty. It's a loud and living reminder of Italy's darkest history. The Italian front was one of the bloodiest of World War I, and the Brenner Valley saw more than its share of violence. In memory of the fallen, cannons from both sides of the conflict were melted and cast to create this peace memorial.

Around the bell is a garden of sculptures and art installations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you think riding a bicycle is exciting, imagine racing 40 miles an hour along steep curves without extra gears or brakes to stop you. This scene happens frequently at the Dick Lane Velodrome, Atlanta’s official home of track cycling. While this velodrome is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary, many Atlantans are unfamiliar with this hidden gem.

The Dick Lane Velodrome is located just eight miles south of downtown Atlanta, in East Point’s Sumner Park. Residents of East Point were inspired to create a velodrome after watching the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The group saw the racers on the Radstadion Velodrome in Olympiapark and decided they needed their own track. (

The course was completed in November 1974 at a cost of about $200,000. Some of the funds came from the Federal Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, the East Point Recreation Department, the State of Georgia, local civic groups, and East Point residents. Dick Lane, the namesake of the Dick Lane Velodrome, was a major fundraiser for the track. Lane was the Director of the East Point Recreation Department and a member of the Georgia State Legislature.

The Dick Lane Velodrome is a 1/5-mile track with 36-degree banked turns. In addition to the track and judges’ stand, it has a parking area, concession building, public seating, a picnic area, and restrooms. The track also offers equipment rentals. It is the only velodrome in the world with a green space containing a large oak tree and a creek running through the infield.

The East Point Velodrome Association, the non-profit group that manages and maintains the track, hosts a number of events throughout the year. Highlights include: Bicycle Safety Clinics, Beginner’s Program, Youth Cycling League, Advanced Training, Weekly Racing, and Pro Racing Series.

There are about two dozen active velodromes in the United States. The closest tracks to the Dick Lane Velodrome are in Ashville, North Carolina, Rock Hill, South Carolina, and Cooper City, Florida.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Get up close and personal with American bison at this wildlife preserve in northeastern Indiana. Although these giant herbivores were once pushed to the brink of extinction by the United States government, careful conservation efforts have helped stabilize populations.

This particular herd consists of around 250 animals, which roam free over 400 acres designed to simulate their natural habitat. Unlike a zoo, this gives visitors the chance to see these charismatic megafauna behave much as they would in the wild. The best time to visit is in mid-May, when around 40 to 50 calves are born each year.

In addition to learning about the bison, visitors can learn more about the history of the Native Americans prior to the arrival of European colonists. There is also a gift shop with souvenirs, as well as bison meat and snacks for purchase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are dinosaurs buried beneath New York City’s Central Park. Now these aren’t your typical T. rex or Triceratops left behind in layers of sediment. These dinosaurs aren’t millions of years old and never took a gulp of air. They’re dapper Victorians, made of cement, wire, stone, and clay. They were entertainers and educators, meant to give New Yorkers their first glimpse of the prehistoric creatures that once roamed New Jersey forests and Connecticut lakeshores. But in 1871, these carefully crafted, life-size models were destroyed, smashed into worthless smithereens, and then buried in a small mound in Central Park. According to historian Vicky Coules of the University of Bristol, the event remains the “greatest act of vandalism in the history of dinosaur study and museum development.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In October 1998, Asmita Kabra, a young economics professor, arrived for the first time in the place that would become Kuno National Park. A dryland forest in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, Kabra remembers how the monsoon that year had turned the trees so green that it hurt her eyes. In the flush of harvest, homes of the local Sahariya people overflowed with goods gathered from the forest, notably chir: a fragrant, green-yellow resin, also known as Indian frankincense, that comes from the salai tree.

Kabra expected to visit Kuno just a couple times, but the place got under her skin, she says. She grew to love its dramatic cycles of drought and abundance. After each rain, the dry brown landscape transformed into a verdant paradise. When Kabra started teaching at Ambedkar Unive…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the highlights of Oslo's Norsk Folkemuseum, or Norwegian Museum of Cultural, is a collection of 160 historic buildings relocated from around the country. The crown jewel is the collection of King Oscar II, considered by many to be the world's first open-air museum. First set up at the monarch's summer residence in 1881, the original five buildings included a 16th-century farmhouse and a 12th-century storehouse.

Most impressive of all is the Stave Church from Gol, a magnificent wooden cathedral first built around 1200 and partially rebuilt and restored in 1880. Intricate carvings cover the richly detailed interior.

Although the church was once filled with brightly painted statues of Catholic saints, today all that remains are the places where the figures once stood and occasional cryptic runes. The nave of the church still reads “Kiss me, because I struggle,” possibly in reference to one of the lost sculptures.]]></summary>

Thanks, that will be fixed in the next version.  You are also reading a section that is much simpler than before (I think/hope), so I hope you like it.  But there is also a higher chance of errors or infelicities, so please let me know if you are not happy.  

The proof of Krull's Principal Ideal Theorem is the same, and I continue to be unhappy that I have not internalized it.  But the rest has become much nicer (after I've talked with people, read some Hochster and Qing Liu and some others, and imbibed more folklore).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The alluring, musky fragrance of marigolds floats from a Hindu shrine, as a group of men laugh over ginger-infused milk teas served in clay cups called kulhads. In a nearby perfume distillery, a man turns his head towards the laughter as he crushes a batch of discarded kulhads. Here in Kannauj, a town in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, generations of perfumers have used kulhads and other clay materials to capture an enticing scent known as mitti attar.

“It’s the smell of the baked, parched earth when the first rains arrive after a long drought,” says Rajat Mehrotra, co-owner of the family-run Meena Perfumery. Perfumers like Mehrotra, who runs the company with his brother, have been bottling the enigmatic fragrance for centuries.

These fossils are about 80 million years old, from the late Jurassic to late Cretaceous period, and are very well preserved. The patterns and shapes are all unique and diverse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thirteen years ago, paleontologist Mario Urbina made a remarkable discovery in the coastal desert of Peru. He had a hunch that it was something really special. But his conclusion was so odd that it took years of excavation and testing to show international scientists that his convictions were right, according to Urbina’s field partner and fellow paleontologist Rodolfo Salas-Gismondi, head of the vertebrate paleontology department at the Museum of Natural History in Lima. They were fossil masses, and what Urbina thought they were: preserved bones from a new species of early whale, dating to 39 million years ago. And, it turns out, this one was a whopper.

“The authors have definitely found something new. This is a really weird, stupendously large, early whale,” says paleobiologist Nicholas…]]></summary>

The Yukku-Rhythm Grand Pendulum Clock is gigantic with a pendulum that is around 72 feet (22 meters) in diameter with a pendulum that takes 30 seconds to swing.

Outside of the atrium clock, the building has several restaurants and a viewing gallery that provides vistas of neighboring buildings. The building's name came from its co-developers, Nihon Seimei and Sumitomo, who are the building's primary occupants.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Madrid was once a city with various walls protected from attackers. Gates were crucial to ensure movement in and out of the city which explains why Madrid is still today a city of gates.

Many of the gates once located around Madrid were demolished. Some still remain, while others have given their name to the place where they were once located. 

Puerta del Sol (Sun Gate) is actually a square and not a gate, but it owes its name to a long-gone gate that was decorated with a sun and was known to locals as "La Puerta del Sol."

There are two possibilities for the origin of the name Puerta del Sol for the square. One of them according to municipal records states that the square got its name from a sun-decorated medieval wall shutter that was destroyed in the 17th century. The other theory is that a gate was built with the sun's rising direction in mind—to the east.

The square has undergone many refurbishments, but this symbol remains as a nod to the past.]]></summary>

It may seem obvious to say that stargazing is, at its heart, a visual hobby. You sit outside in the darkness, and allow your pupils to dilate, letting in as much faint light as possible—and then you can see the universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Karen, a leafy suburb of Nairobi, chef Dennis Ang’ani whips up a unique fusion experience for just 12 visitors per seating on a greenery-laden cabin terrace. The multi-course dining concept is primarily inspired by local produce and traditional East African recipes done up with culinary techniques picked up by Ang’ani abroad.

Root and vine vegetables are freshly plucked from Embark’s own gardens. Ingredients are showcased using European techniques, from foams to fermentation, with elaborate presentations, and occasional garnishes of flowers plucked from Nairobi’s Physic Garden.

Expect a walk on the earthy side: a chilled banana and rum soup with a garden salad in Bailey’s and macadamia nut vinaigrette, seared tofu in Ethiopian shiro (a spicy chickpea sauce), or mini plantain burgers. Vegetable-based desserts often tread into especially wild, savory territory; from Amarula-braised eggplant with aerated broccoli ice cream, to ugali (corn maize) with creamed spinach.

All in all, the menu reflects Ang’ani’s multicultural experiences. After growing up in a German-Kenyan household, he moved around Europe working in kitchens from the Baltics to Barcelona, and fluently speaks German, English, Swahili, and Spanish.

Though as a child he dreamed of becoming a pro soccer player in Europe, he maintains that bringing an innovative approach to the African fine-dining scene has been a more fulfilling challenge for him than any league could be; and even requires similar skills like dexterity, teamwork and performance under pressure. 

A picture of Coach Pep Guardiola, one of Ang’ani’s heroes, hanging from a wall-mounted handwoven basket, helps him to remember the importance of being a good leader and most importantly, to never be limited by conventionality and cultural borders.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Devil's Porridge refers to the explosive that was mixed at HM Gretna. Gun cotton and nitroglycerin were kneaded together by the munitions girls to make RDB cordite. This mixture got its name because looked like a deadly form of porridge.

Prior to the building of HM Grenta, this location was quiet, with only a few farms and villages in the area. Then World War I began. In just 12 months, the government acquired the land and built a massive factory. The HM Gretna site was huge, it covered a distance of nine miles, stretching down to England.

There were 30,000 workers, 12,000 of whom were women. Lots of the munitions girls moved to the area, especially to work at the factory, moving from areas like Durham, Darlington, and Sunderland. The chemicals were highly toxic, the girls' skin would turn yellow and they often lost all of their teeth. The contribution to the war effort made by the munitions girls here at HM Gretna helped women achieve the vote in the United Kingdom.

By 1917, the factory was producing 1,100 tons of cordite a week. This was significantly more than all the other munitions factories in Britain put together. This explosive was then shipped out to the troops on the front line.

The museum has a special version of a train, a fireless locomotive, designed to safely transport the explosive on display in the grounds. The museum tells the story of the girls who worked here and the Irish navvies who built the massive factory.

It also covers a horrific troop train crash at Quintinshill. While the second floor is dedicated to WWII. With a small section covering nuclear power and the local nuclear power station.]]></summary>

Occasionally, a baleen whale, such as a humpback, strays from the migratory superhighway off the coast and into Twofold Bay in Eden. The alarm atop the tiny town’s killer whale museum is sounded to notify the town’s 3,000 or so residents and any tourists to this scenic stretch of coastline. Over 150 years ago, the town hosted a different marine show. Orcas, or killer whales, the largest of the dolphin family, used to visit this bay every winter, and were vital to a unique way of life in Eden.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upon first glance, this may look like just another historic building found across Boston. However, upon entering the Liberty Hotel, one realizes this was no ordinary building but rather once a jail that was in operation for more than a century.

Originally known as the Charles Street Jail or  Suffolk County Jail, it's located on the west end of the city overlooking the Charles River. It was constructed between 1848-1851 and proposed by Mayor Martin Brimmer during his inaugural address of 1843 as a replacement for the older Leverett Street Jail.

The original jail was built using Quincy granite with four wings extending from a central octagonal rotunda and housed around 220 cells. The prisoners were segregated by sex and nature of offense with 30 arched windows providing ventilation and natural light.

Throughout its years of operation, it housed a wide range of inmates from mob hitmen to a former governor. In 1973, the United States District Court ruled that due to overcrowding and neglected conditions, the constitutional rights of the inmates were being violated and the jail closed in 1990. It reopened in 2007 as the Liberty Hotel with much of the historic architecture still preserved.]]></summary>

Gaudí's imaginative touch is evident in the innovative use of materials, incorporating iron, brick, and ceramics alongside traditional stone.

Gaudí made a significant mark on the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, Spain, with his distinctive architectural style. The palace, constructed between 1889 and 1915, stands as a brilliant fusion of various influences, showcasing Gaudí's innovative ideas and artistic vision.

The most striking feature of Gaudí's intervention in the palace is the facade. Adorned with a combination of organic and geometric motifs, it reflects his fascination with nature and its organic forms. The building's interiors also bear Gaudí's creative flair, with unique decorative elements and functional yet aesthetically pleasing spaces.

Gaudí's work on the Episcopal Palace in Astorga exemplifies his ability to transform existing architectural designs into masterpieces that harmoniously blend traditional and avant-garde styles. The building stands today as a testament to Gaudí's genius, drawing visitors from around the world to marvel at its beauty and architectural significance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last month, we announced our first photo contest, when we asked readers for creative shots of their favorite roadside attractions. At Atlas Obscura, we adore the spectacles lurking beside roads all over the world, so we asked: What turned your heads recently recently?
Since then, we received more than 600 images of fascinating sights. Readers sent us technicolor dinosaurs dressed up for Halloween, black-and-white gravestones, curious art hidden in deserts. Reviewing these submissions reminded us how much fun it can be to make stops on a long journey—or perhaps a roadside attraction is your destination!

Check out our wonderful winning photos (click to see the up close), selected by our staff—the first place winner is above. We hope it will inspire many great summer road trips!
Congratulations to our winners, who scored some Atlas Obscura gear!
Look out for our future Summer Snaps contests! Enter the next one here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bees and wasps drinking water to cool themselves down isn’t an unusual sight on a sweltering summer day, but a tiny drinking fountain tailor-made for their kind may be rather rare.

Hitokotonushi Shrine in the city of Jōsō, Ibaraki Prefecture, is known for such a drinking fountain catering to the thirsty little bees, which has been set up every summer since 2020. This small act of kindness has been appreciated by hundreds of bees—and warmed the hearts of thousands.

The honeybee drinking fountain was first created in 2016, but it did not reappear for the next four years due to the lack of apian visitors during that time. Attached to the ablution pavilion, the fountain’s platform is made from bamboo and stuffed with moss, which provides a footing for the bees and creates the feeling of a serene fairytale scene.

The small sign standing on the drinking fountain reads “a drinking spot reserved for groups of honeybees,” but paper wasps are also often seen drinking water from it. They do not only drink water to cool themselves down, but also carry it back to their hives to keep the temperature comfortable so that the babies are not harmed by the summer heat.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although nobody can guarantee whether the remains of Ibn Battuta are really kept inside this impressive white mausoleum, this is perhaps the closest one can get to one of the greatest explorers in history.

Ibn Battuta, the famous Moroccan explorer, and traveler, is widely regarded as one of the greatest travelers in history. He embarked on a remarkable journey in the 14th century that took him through Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and beyond, covering a distance believed to be over 75,000 miles.

Battuta was born in Tangier in 1304 and set out on his travels at the age of 21. His adventures spanned nearly three decades, during which he explored various regions, experienced different cultures, and met numerous rulers and dignitaries.

His written account, known as the Rihla, provides invaluable insights into the medieval world, shedding light on the diverse cultures, customs, and political landscapes of the places he visited. Battuta's travelogue serves as a significant historical source, capturing the socio-economic conditions, religious practices, and intercultural exchanges of the time, making it an indispensable resource for scholars and a captivating literary work that continues to inspire wanderlust and cultural curiosity.

There are plenty of historical markers or memorials related to Battuta in the city, given his significant contribution to Moroccan and world history. As a prominent figure, he is also celebrated throughout Morocco and the broader Muslim world for his travel accounts and contributions to geographical knowledge.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing we discovered this past academic year is that NASA  took more than 300,000 images of Saturn's rings! Today I met with Maya Nesen (NYU) and Ana Pacheco (NYU) to look at  raw spacecraft data. Nesen is working on the tabulated housekeeping data, giving the position and orientation of the spacecraft and instruments in various coordinate systems (that we are trying to work out). Pacheco is working on the raw imaging data from the imaging module. We discussed how to display the imaging so that an astronomer can confirm the the noise level and rough noise properties in the pixels. We discussed adjustments to our plots of the housekeeping data to aid in our interpretation of it. In particular, we looked at some of the camera-related meta data and it looks like the camera might have a few different zoom settings. I guess we have to read some documentation!CassiniCassini]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Across the United States, there is no shortage of historical churches. Ranging from different time periods, denominations, and congregations, churches across America have been a defining feature throughout the nation's history. Although many churches have a unique history, there is one church in Framingham that has a particularly notable distinction as being the first public performance and singing of the Battle Hymn of the Republic.

The church was founded in 1701 and by the time of the American Civil War, it was called the Hollis Evangelical Congregational Church. On the evening of February 22, 1862, the residents of Framingham gathered in the church to celebrate the 130th anniversary of George Washington's birthday and read aloud his 1796 farewell address as encouraged by President Lincoln via national proclamation three days earlier. The speech was read by Norman School principal George Bigelow and the program was concluded with the singing of Battle Hymn of the Republic by Julia Ward Howe which was published in The Atlantic Monthly that same month. 

The song became extremely renowned in the United States with its abolitionist and religious themes resonating strongly with supporters of the Union cause during the American Civil War. It was one of the most popular songs among Union troops and became a staple of United States military music. Today, it's considered a classic patriotic song with many renditions, tributes, and parodies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pune shares a wonderful relationship with hills. Both within and around the city, there are several lush green hills where visitors can find historic forts, temples, monuments, and caves.

ARAI Hill, also known as Vetal Hill, is the highest point in the city at an elevation of over 2,000 feet. The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) is located here. A temple of Vetal and a few other temples are also located on the hill. A short distance from ARAI and the temples is a large abandoned stone quarry that has formed a lake.

The quarry is a paradise for nature lovers. Every morning and evening, people visit the hill for walking, jogging, photography, bird watching, yoga, meditation, exploring nature, and watching the city from one of its highest points. The hill is accessible from multiple areas, as there are walking trails from all sides. All the trails converge towards the center at the top, where the stone quarry lake is located.

Some portions of the hill are covered with dense trees, while others are grasslands. The quarry lake, with its marshy areas and shallow waters, has created a wetland with an ecosystem of its own. One can spot several rare and exotic bird species here.

The hill is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The views offered from here are breathtaking. One can see the city stretching into the distance where there are more hills at the horizon.]]></summary>

Also called Billiken-san, this narrow-eyed dwarf with an onion-shaped head is said to be a lucky god, particularly revered by merchants who believe that rubbing the feet of his effigy brings you good luck. While he is well-known across Japan, it often goes unmentioned that he does not originate in Japan, but in Kansas City, Missouri.

Billiken, the "god of things as they ought to be," was designed circa 1907-1908 by illustrator Florence Pretz for her friend Sarah Hamilton Birchall's stories published in The Canada West magazine. He instantly proved to be a hit, exceptionally profitable (except to the designer herself, much to her chagrin). Billiken statuettes were warmly receive…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia presided over the inauguration of the Queen Victoria Bridge on June 13, 1909. The bridge was named in honor of the king's wife. It connects Bombilla Park, the two hermitages of San Antonio de la Florida, with the Colonia de San Antonio de La Florida and the Colonia del Manzanares.

Based on a design by architect Julio Martnez-Zapata Rodriguez, it was built by engineer José Eugenio Ribera Dutaste. The bridge includes two, parallel elliptical reinforced concrete arches that are decorated in modernist style. It also has two lanes for cars. Additionally, Queen Victoria Bridge is one of Spain's earliest concrete bridges. Four vases and eight cast-iron lampposts decorated by Francisco Iglesias with bears serve as its adornment.

During the Second Spanish Republic, the bridge changed its name to Puente de Galicia. After the Spanish Civil War, it recovered its original name. On one of its sides, visitors can see a commemorative plaque placed on June 13, 1999, to celebrate its 19th anniversary.

Its ornamental components, which are mostly concentrated on the board, reflect the modernist trends of the day. Four vases and eight iron lampposts (two and four at each end) are placed on it, at the base of which different rampant bears appear, in a clear reference to the heraldic shield of Madrid.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1899 when the Moore-Lindsay Historical House was constructed it cost approximately $5,000, ten times what the average home in the area cost to build. William Moore and his wife Agnes were an important part of society in Norman. The house was later sold to Agnes’ niece and her husband, Harry, and Daisy Lindsay.

The remnants of Daisy Lindsay’s locally famous rose garden can still be seen on the property next door. In the 1960s, the family sold the house and it was divided into apartments. They didn’t last long, however, before the building was condemned. The city of Norman saved the house and opened it as a museum in the 1970s. 

The museum is now furnished as an example of the typical Oklahoma Victorian house. The house contains artifacts from around Cleveland County, including a woman’s side-saddle ridden by Martha Giles in the Land Run of 1889.

Standing in the market square, the “Fat Policeman” statue was created by Finnish sculptor Kaarlo Mikkonen (1920-2001) and has since become a beloved icon of the city. Nicknamed Uncle Karl, the affable bronze copper is clad in a circa-mid-20th-century uniform, complete with a dated helmet and a dapper mustachio.

Uncle Karl is notable for his belly, which has a gloriously golden patina—a clear sign that it has been rubbed by many. Local superstition has it that rubbing his belly grants you good luck and immunity against weight gain so that one can enjoy as much Hungarian food as they like.]]></summary>

If you spent any time on the website formerly known as Twitter in the last few months, you may have seen a vintage menu going viral.

The menu, dated to February 17, 1941, is from the Warner Bros. Studio Cafe in Burbank, California. What made it so fascinating was the sheer amount of food and the number of midcentury oddities on offer. The hungry starlet or sound technician, if their wallets allowed, could start with imported caviar, follow it up with a T-bone steak, and finish their meal with a glass of half-and-half.

It’s incredible how many details about the era jump off a single page. One of the daily specials was “hot dogs with Liberty cabbage and carrots.…]]></summary>

Rivers have been the lifeblood of human civilization throughout history, and yet we know surprisingly little about what lives in many of them—including the giant creatures that prowl their depths.

While we know the biggest animal in the ocean is the blue whale and the largest marine fish is the whale shark, the identity of the world’s largest freshwater fish species long remained a mystery.

Until 2022, that is, when fishers in Cambodia caught a giant freshwater stingray in the remote reaches of the Mekong River.

Weighing an astounding 661 pounds, the stingray surpassed by 15 pounds a giant catfish caught in Thailand in 2005 that had previously been considered the unofficial …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coyoacán was once a town completely separate from Mexico City. As such, it needed its own central square, what is now the Plaza Hidalgo. When this plaza was being built, a large stone ring with a figure carved on it was unearthed. This was a tlachtemalácatl, the name in Náhuatl (the language of the Aztec/Mexica people) for the "goals" of the Mesoamerican Ballgame. Known as tlachtli, variants of this game were played by the Indigenous peoples of most of Mexico and Central America, almost always with ritualistic and symbolic purposes.

This particular malacatl of the tlachtli game was so well-carved that it was kept after being found, and eventually placed in a prominent position in the Jesús Reyes Heroles House of Culture, in what is now the Mexico City borough of Coyoacán. This cultural center was once an actual house, and its late 18th-century architecture shows it. It also functioned as a paper factory for some time, and in 1985, was established as a House of Culture.

Its namesake, Jesús Reyes Heroles, was a significant 20th-century intellectual who delved into law, politics, and history. Usually advocating in favor of democratic values and human rights, his legacy led to many institutions other than this center being named after him.]]></summary>

Thanks!  I see what you mean, and it definitely could be.  The one with times maps to the one with the otimes, which maps to the right side of that map in the notes.  So we're both right.

(And thanks for your other suggestions and corrections you sent by email; I think I owe you a response, and if so, hope to get to it soon.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started writing in a possible grant proposal (that would be in collaboration with others) about the trustworthiness of machine-learning emulators. Emulators are systems that learn the input–output relationship of a computationally expensive simulation and produce (or speed the computation of) new simulation outputs, reducing total computational requirements for a given number of simulations. These are so important now that the ESA  and  data-analysis plans crucially involve emulation.EuclidSimons Observatory
The issue is: How do we trust that the emulators are giving good outputs? There is no obvious way to test them, except by comparing to held-out training data. But in large-scale structure contexts, no amount of held-out data can test the enormous input data space. I don't know how we will ever trust such systems (and damn do we need to!), but I have some ideas about how to improve the situation. One involves enforcing physics symmetries on the emulators. Another involves running adversarial attacks on them.]]></summary>

Deep in the mid-winter Maine woods in 1902, a young chemist persuaded six lumberjacks to be his lab rats. For one 18-meal work-week, he cataloged every scrap of food the men were about to eat, then he collected all the relevant feces, sealing them in “museum jars” and freezing them in a snowbank cache. With the cooperation of the camp cook, he also assembled and froze samples of every type of food served to the men. He then transported all these icy jars to the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Maine at Orono for analysis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the minerals of a mining town have been fully extracted, there is a chance that it will become a ghost town. That is what happened to Real de Catorce in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí when its silver ran dry in the early 20th century. But it was never completely abandoned. 

The land around the town, particularly the desert below, is known as Wirikuta, the sacred land of the Huichol people. Real de Catorce has long been a pilgrimage site for them due to its proximity to Wirikuta. It's also a place of pilgrimage for Roman Catholics. The Parish of Immaculate Conception Cathedral draws visitors hoping to ask a favor from Saint Frances Assisi.

Today, the town sees pilgrims of a different sort, namely tourists in search of the magic that keeps visitors coming to this out-of-the-way location. When silver mining ended over a century ago, the town's population dropped down to the hundreds. Today the town has around a thousand permanent residents. The sizable tourist flow keeps its small hotels busy. 

Much of the town is abandoned. Be sure to visit the historic bullfighting ring and its amphitheater. A hike up to the hills will give you a panoramic view of the town and its surroundings. Throughout the town, the Huichol sell their intricate, colorful artwork.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In May 1974, a 27-year-old director named Steven Spielberg set out to make a movie about a shark, based on a hit novel that had come out just months earlier, also about a shark. In August 2023, a new Broadway play is opening at the Golden Theater on West 45th Street in New York, The Shark Is Broken, about the trials, tribulations, and humor of the making of the movie—Jaws, obviously—that changed the film industry.

The play dramatizes the bickering between three stars of the film—Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and Robert Shaw, whose son Ian co-wrote and stars in the play—and the difficulties of having a giant, animatronic shark as a scene partner. Back in 1974, it wasn’t just the fake shark that presented challenges—the production was menaced by real live sharks before the real filming e…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asbestos Cottage was built in 1897 by prospectors coming to Kahurangi National Park to search for asbestos. What we now know to be a carcinogenic mineral, asbestos was widely used for over a century to provide a fireproof barrier and insulation to buildings.

One miner in particular, Henry Chaffey, lived in this isolated hut for over 40 years with his wife Annie Fox. Visitors today will be struck by the isolation of the building, tucked between mountains and forests. One can only imagine how lonesome it would have been a hundred years ago. However, Annie was always glad to greet visitors in her impressive Edwardian-style clothing.

Chaffey would make visits to Motueka and Takaka by foot for provisions and to sell what he was able to mine in order to support himself and his wife. This trek would have taken him days to complete.]]></summary>

The massive complex, rebuilt in the 1950s in the traditional Mongol style, houses genuine relics and is an important sanctuary for the shamanic worship of the legendary Mongol leader. But the Khan’s tomb is properly called a cenotaph—a monument to someone buried elsewhere—because it is empty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just off the bustling Magazine Street in the Irish Channel, the National Shrine of Blessed Father Xavier Seelos welcomes visitors to learn of the mystical life of the “Cheerful Ascetic.” The Redemptorist order established the site to promote the canonization cause of Seelos.

Born Francis Xavier Seelos in Bavaria, Germany in 1819, he eventually pursued a religious life and was ordained by the Redemptorist order in 1842. Seelos traveled to the United States, first residing in New York to minister to German-speaking immigrants. During his lifetime, Seelos witnessed the chaos of the American Civil War. Father Seelos urged President Lincoln to excuse seminarians from military service during the conflict. He transferred to New Orleans in 1866 where his life ended from yellow fever a year later at the age of 48.

An in-depth account of his life is portrayed at the center, which includes a wide range of artifacts including his original lead coffin. His cilice and flagellum are on display in the Walk of Life section of the campus. Hours and days of operation vary and large groups are encouraged to make arrangements in advance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[August 2023 promises to be a big month for the Moon. On August 1 and August 30 (Eastern Time), the orb will be near its perigee—its closest point to Earth—and the full moon will loom large in the night sky, a phenomenon brilliantly branded as the "supermoon." The full moon on August 2 is the Sturgeon Moon, a name drawn from the belief that the best fishing occurs under its glow, and the one on August 30 is a Blue Moon, the relatively rare second appearance of a full moon in a single month.

But even when the moon isn't at its (seemingly) biggest and brightest, humans have been entranced by it as a celestial body. From the Atlas Obscura archive, explore centuries of attempts to map, explore, own, and even spend eternity on Earth's only natural satellite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All week I have been discussing with Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA) the possibility that we could find the elusive, truly zero metallicity stars in the Milky Way halo. This from an email I wrote today, reacting to the observational point that no-one has ever seen such a star:
How could there be absolutely ZERO zero-metallicity stars in the Milky Way? Here's everything I got:

Maybe there are literally no low-mass stars ever made at zero metallicity. Absolutely none, at high precision. This is possible, given how little we know about star formation and the IMF.
Maybe stellar evolution is so weird at zero metallicity that low-mass stars go dark by 13 Gyr. I very much doubt that this is a possibility. But maybe low-mass stars at primordial abundances never burn and just slowly collapse into white-dwarf-like condensed objects on a very long cooling timescale. They would be super cold by now, like 100 K maybe??
Maybe low-mass stars form slower than high-mass stars in star-forming regions at zero metallicity. This permits a few of the high-mass stars to quickly evolve and explode, polluting the outsides of the just-forming low-mass stars. These low-mass stars would then have low but non-zero surface metallicities, and be very alpha-enhanced. This is possible, although would it really leave NO zero-metallicity low-mass stars behind?
Maybe low-mass stars somehow self-pollute at formation (or later in their lives). Maybe the nuclear fusion kicks in slightly before gravitational steady-state or radiative zones are set up, and the first bit of nuclear burning gets mixed in to the stellar envelopes? These stars would appear to have non-zero (but weird, carbon-enhanced maybe?) abundances. Or maybe this happens later in life because of some weird internal mixing. I have literally no idea whether any of this is possible.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my last post, I asked " why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters on the issue [of abortion]"? I should have said something like "why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters by adopting more moderate positions"?  As I suggested in a post a few years ago, another way to appeal to moderate voters is by focusing on the negative--fears of what the extremists on the other side might do.  That's what the Democrats have done, and it's worked pretty well because many prominent Republicans have taken extreme positions.  Also, there is an asymmetry on the abortion issue--it's easier to find shocking examples of women who were denied abortions that most people will agree should have been allowed (e. g., the case that came up shortly after the Dobbs decision, a 10-year-old rape victim who had to travel out of Ohio to get an abortion) than shocking examples of women who had abortions that most people agree shouldn't have been allowed.  So if it comes down to a contest of extreme positions, the side favoring legal abortion is likely to win.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Indigenous Eats, owner Jenny Slagle and her husband, Andrew, serve Native American dishes prepared using family recipes. Offerings range from Indian tacos to desserts drenched in huckleberry sauce, and ingredients are sourced exclusively from locally owned Native American businesses. Fry bread, which appears here in both sweet and savory forms, is made according to a recipe from the owner’s mother. 

Slagle, a member of the Yakama Nation and descendant of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, always dreamed of running a restaurant for Native American comfort food. For years, she ran an Indian taco stand with her four children and mother at Spokane’s annual Falls Pow Wow. Finally, an inspiring visit to Denver’s Tocabe: An American Indian Eatery, reassured her there was an appetite for such dishes. In 2022, Indigenous Eats was born.

Around the restaurant’s deli-style order counter, walls are adorned with local Indigenous art and traditional melodies resound from the speakers. Exhibits and posters paint a picture of the vibrant Spokane’s Indigenous ancestry, where over 300 tribes in the county have created lively community spaces.

Slagle and her family recipes have proven that even a fast food restaurant can be a powerful medium for preserving heritage and celebrating Native American culture.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last 20 years, this family-owned haven for hearty Polish fare has been gracing downtown Glendale with hunter's stew, pierogis, kielbasa, goulash, cabbage rolls, and so much more. (“A Touch of European” might be more aptly named “A Bear Hug from Poland”). Portions are generous, but save room for dessert, which includes house-baked cookies such as angel wings and kolaczki.

Chef-owner Waldemar Okula is fiercely proud of his homeland—a fact readily apparent to anyone who's gone on one of his annual culinary tours of Poland. Twice a year, he hosts a cooking class where participants either learn how to make Easter classics like white borscht or a Polish-style Christmas feast.

It's BYOB, it's cash only, and it's unlike anything else you'll find in the greater metro Phoenix area. You'll hear the owners speaking Polish amongst themselves and to other diners who've immigrated from the region.

If the specials include a dill pickle soup, order a cup. Do not doubt its power.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Mary Coyle moved to Phoenix from Ohio in 1951, she brought a knack for making ice cream with her from the midwest. Her namesake parlor, Mary Coyle Ol' Fashion Ice Cream, continues to survive and thrive in a smaller, nearby location, 72 years later. At 16% butterfat, the ice cream itself is ultra-rich and is still made on-site to this day using the original recipes that first made Mary a success.

Not only are the options premium, but they're also expansive. The variety of flavors—an unexpected feature for a classic ice cream parlor—is a thrill in and of itself. Choose from a wide range of popular and nostalgic flavors, from black raspberry to black licorice, spumoni to burgundy cherry. Carefully sourced ingredients, such as the nuts in the butter pecan and maple walnut flavors sourced from Mount Hope, in Sedona, make each scoop shine.

The new location's checkerboard floors, neon soda fountain sign, and pink-striped walls (which harken back to the original location) let you know you're in for a deliciously sweet time travel session.]]></summary>

That night, Sakata was looking back on a distinguished six decades at the head of Japan’s top seed company. He had founded Sakata Seed Corporation in 1913, growing it from a small purveyor of lily bulbs into a major multinational developer of flower, fruit, and vegetable varieties. Today, the spaghetti squash can be counted among Sakata’s many successes; but it was far from an overnight one.

Since the 1930s, Sakata had been the exclusive marketer of spaghetti squash in the United States. According to Dr. Harry Paris of Israel’s Volcani Institute Agricultural Research Organization…]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-27T13:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The commune and spa town of Bagnères-de-Luchon is situated in the picturesque valleys and hills of southwestern France. Nestled close to the Spanish border, the town sits among the foothills of the French Pyrenees and is renowned for its thermal springs. For centuries, especially in the Victorian period, attracted people in poor health looking to convalesce in a scenic setting. One can easily imagine bourgeois visitors coming to Luchon to bask in therapeutic waters, perhaps as they cough discretely into a bloodstained lace handkerchief.

Today, Luchon's tourists enjoy the benefits of the waters sans illnesses. Modern upgrades to the Thermes buildings demonstrate that Luchon's restorative springs remain as popular as ever with visitors.

The local architecture is a curious mix of Belle Epoque grandeur and Tyrolean ski resort, unsurprising, given that the town also caters to skiers and snowboarders who venture into the snow-capped mountains every winter. The town remains a beautiful spot to enjoy a coffee at a boulevard cafe while admiring the majestic mountain range that dominates the town's skyline.

These breathtaking peaks also captivated the writer, poet, and playwright Edmond Rostand who spent many summers enjoying the unique pleasures of Luchon while residing at Villa Julia, a holiday home built by the Rostand family. Here, Edmond composed love letters and wrote his most famous literary work, Cyrano De Bergerac.   

A commemorative bust was erected in 1922, four years after Rostand's death at the age of 50. The statue features his curly mustache and an unmistakable creative air as the statue looks wistfully into the middle distance seeking inspiration. Appropriately the bust sits where his effigy can view the mountains, the river Pique, and Villa Julia.  

It's a discrete but fitting tribute to a man known as France's National Poet who gave the world one of its most famous literary characters and who found vast reserves of inspiration in the splendor of the Pyrenees and the charming spa town of Luchon.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-07-26T22:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grandma’s cake and chit-chat—that’s the concept behind the lovable Munich café and bakery Kuchentratsch (in German, ‘cake gossip’).

Located in the heart of the Bavarian capital, this sweet haven has perfected the typical German tradition of Kaffee und Kuchen-Zeit (afternoon coffee and cake time) and put it toward a good cause. The establishment doubles as a social initiative startup where all fresh-baked confections are made by local elderly folks.

Founded in 2014, Kuchentratsch serves some of the city’s best traditional German cakes. Depending on the season, and who’s aproned-up that day, a delectable selection may include anything from rhubarb torte to crumb cake (Streuselkuchen) to marble cake (Marmorkuchen). Cakes are displayed in a glass vitrine next to the name of the Oma or Opa (grandma or grandpa) who made them.

Cakes are delivered Germany-wide but for sit-in guests, the bakery provides cozy tables in an inviting interior. Think: large glass windows are adorned with plush armchairs against a strawberry-pink ceiling. Throughout the day, elderly folks bake in an open kitchen and socialize around tables, gabbing while waiting on their oven timers. Pensioners work part-time at Kuchentratsch, and many spend their retirement time getting together here, even when they’re not on duty for the dough.

The wafting aromas of warm treats and happy banter contribute to the ambience that owners Katharina Mayer and Katrin Blaschke always wanted: an interactive “experience bakery” spanning tastes and generations. Along with frequent baking workshops, Kuchentratsch aims to support the elderly with a fun hobby that provides purpose, prevents loneliness and supplements pensions with extra pocket money.

So, whether you go for the poppy seed crumble or a chocolate cake made especially for the vegan crowd, rest assured that, as the German saying also goes in English, “the way to one’s heart is always through the stomach.”]]></summary>

I have been working on this in part because it is a good measurement to make with , and in part because the dipole in the quasars . I have many thoughts, but I will save them for later.Quaiais controversial
Anyways, Abby Williams (NYU) has been working on making this measurement, and her dipole amplitude and direction depend on what we hold fixed and what we vary (in particular selection-function components), and they also depend on what sky region we use. None of this is surprising; the selection function has a strong dipole in it, and it is not known precisely. But then I don't understand how the studies published previously have such good error bars. Maybe they didn't consider the various different fitting regimes?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taiwan, an island, cherishes seafood as a culinary staple. For generations, seafood soups and congee used to dominate the breakfast tables and early morning street food stall menus, until they were slowly phased out for more popular wheat-based dishes like scallion pancakes and egg crepes. Emmanuel is one of the few exceptions and has been whipping up comforting bowls of hot tilapia soup for hungry customers in the morning since 1977. 

For decades, the place was an old road side stall servicing blue-collar workers. But in 2021, the third-generation owner convinced his parents to take over and give the brand a 21st-century face-lift. They’ve since relocated to a cozy brick-and-mortar space with indoor seating and air conditioning. 

Despite the refresh, the menu and the prices have stayed exactly the same: whole slabs of fish sourced fresh from the market daily are served in soup, usually paired with a hearty serving of stir-fried rice vermicelli with a heaping of braised ground pork, crunchy bean sprouts, and housemade chili sauce. Every fish is carefully skinned and gutted and served whole—with the head, eyes, and fins still intact. 

While the menu is small, there is something for everyone on it. If fish isn’t your thing, they do a classic egg drop soup or one topped with hearty slices of pork.The best part? The prices for each dish has stayed well under 100 NTD ($3 USD).]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real Guts Cafe is a mecca for Taiwanese cinephiles. Stocked with movie paraphernalia and books, it is the brainchild of Taiwanese director Wei Te-sheng, whose Cape No. 7 was Taiwan's second highest-grossing movie of all time and achieved the longest theatrical release in the island’s cinematic history. 

The food is typical cafe fare: coffees, teas, sandwiches, waffles. For something more substantial, they do a decent barbecued pork, sliced into thin pieces, paired with a sunny side-up egg and served over rice. There are grilled rice balls and bright salads. Even local craft beer if one is so inclined. 

However, the food is secondary because the main draw at Real Guts is the decor. There are old film cameras, director clapboards from Wei’s movie sets, and two real Golden Horse awards (considered the Oscars of Chinese-language cinema) on display. There’s also an entire bookshelf brimming with storyboards and set design drafts, plus a merchandise section selling miscellanea like T-shirts of endemic Taiwanese animals. 

While it’s all a bit chaotic, Real Guts draws a consistent crowd of work-from-home folks and students, who like the floor-to-ceiling windows and lush foliage that hangs from the nooks and crannies of the space. Stocked with a reasonable amount of outlets and Wi-Fi, it is a relaxing place to pull up a laptop and get some work done.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The common shrew only lives about a year. Black rhinos, on the other hand, can make it to a 50th birthday. They’re very different creatures, for sure, but even species that are rather alike—take a lab rat and a wild, hairless counterpart, the naked mole rat—can have drastically different lifespans, too. Think three years versus 30. We humans can live twice or three times as long as our closest relatives, chimpanzees.

It’s natural to ask which mammal lives the longest. Spoiler alert: It’s the bowhead whale. (There are a few other, non-mammalian creatures that have them beat: a deep-dwelling shark, a clam, a jellyfish that just doesn’t die at all.) But what constitutes a long life can vary widely based on size and lifestyle, metabolism and environment, so maybe the better question is why s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every day, scores of tourists cross Charles Bridge and flock towards the John Lennon Wall in the Malá Strana district, making their way across the island of Kampa. If you take that route, chances are you'll be passing over the Čertovka, or the Devil's Stream, a quaint little canal that gives the area its nickname: Little Venice.

As you cross a small bridge over the stream, there'll be a post-medieval water mill called the Grand Priory Mill on the other side, just about 50 yards away from the John Lennon Wall. At first glance, it's simply a cute, quaint sight, but then you'll catch sight of a strange figure sitting on the wooden platform beside it. Squint and zoom in, and you will see that it's not really a human figure, but a googly-eyed, green-skinned goblin smoking a pipe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just south of England's Lake District in Cumbria, a medieval building, known as the Castle Dairy in Kendal, has two minuscule windows that provide just enough light for the 700-year-old rooms. The Castle Dairy may be the oldest continuously inhabited building in the historic market town, and it's believed someone has lived there since the early 14th century.

Originally built as a farmhouse, the building's subsequent uses are unknown, though it was possibly used as a private residence. The name "dairy" may have been a corruption of "dowry" and it has been inferred that the property was once a widow's home.

While some of the original windows were once bricked up, over the years many of them have been reopened. On the upper floor, there is a small chapel with one of the small windows while the other miniature window looks out from the other side of the house.

One local story claims that the floor contains remnants from a Roman road, which once ran along the banks of the river Kent.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For first-timers, a trip to Taiwan isn’t complete without a hearty bowl of beef noodle soup. A dish unique to the island, it was invented in the mid-20th century by refugees who had left the Chinese mainland for Taiwan during the Chinese civil war. Today, it’s become somewhat of the national dish of Taiwan. But with over 10,000 dedicated beef noodle soup shops on the island, narrowing down the options is a harrowing task. 

Chef Hung Beef Noodle Soup is a great place to start. The eponymous owner Hung Ching-Lung is a five-time award-winning champion of the annual beef noodle soup competition in Taiwan—the most decorated winner in the event’s history. 

The restaurant’s menu offers a diverse overview of the beef noodle soup options on the island, from a classic star-anise-heavy broth flavored with spicy bean paste to a minimally seasoned clear broth where delicate slices of beef are highlighted. A couple of Hung’s award-winning bowls are on the menu as well: there’s one topped with tripe, tendon, and shank and another with medium rare, paper-thin slices of beef overlaid on top. 

For Chef Hung, beef noodle soup is much more than just a profession. It’s a passion. He has a cattle farm on the outlying island of Kinmen, where he raises his own cows for the restaurants. And he’s often tasked with training up-and-coming chefs on how to make a fantastic beef broth for their restaurants. He says the key is procuring a really high-quality cut of beef and making a flavorful broth. Everything else is just secondary.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The church of St. George the Martyr is the oldest Anglican church in Southeast Asia. Before the church was built, religious services in Penang were conducted at Fort Cornwallis and later at the courthouse in George Town, a short distance away. Plans for a church were submitted as early as 1810 but it wasn’t until the East India Company Act of 1813 gave the British East India Company authority that the church was built. It was constructed in 1818 and consecrated in 1819 costing some 60,000 Spanish dollars (also known as "pieces of eight").

The first significant event that took place in the church after its completion was the wedding of Governor William Edward Philips to Janet Bannerman, the daughter of his predecessor, Colonel John Alexander Bannerman on June 30, 1818.

On the grounds stands a memorial to Francis Light, a British explorer and the founder of the British colony of Penang and its capital city George Town in 1786. Interestingly, he is also the father of William Light, who founded the city of Adelaide in Australia.

The church was first restored after being looted and badly damaged during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia in the Second World War. It was restored again in 2011 after being designated a National Heritage in 2007.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This eclectic 80s erotica-themed bar fronted by a bright and loud neon sign is a celebration of vices. Inside: a cheeky diner awash in red lighting, analog phones, floral print diner chairs, plush banquettes, and a working disco ball in the corner. Keeping with the theme, the shelves are stocked with magazines crammed with centerfolds of busty, scantily clad women.  

The aesthetic of Pure Love is a nod to the “grandpa shops” of Taipei—old-school karaoke rooms where older men are known to seek the company and services of flirtatious waitresses. Big in the ‘60s and up to the ‘80s, they have since waned considerably in popularity after a crackdown in prostitution in the ‘90s.  

Pure Love Snack Bar is a modern revival of the grandpa shop, but without any of the shady or illegal dealings. The food is unpretentious and rooted in Taiwanese classics like braised pork over rice, oyster soup, fried chicken, and deep-fried noodles smothered in an earthy satay sauce. The drinks are more elevated and utilize locally available flavors like guava, tieguanyin tea, and mulberry.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked inside an old wooden building framed by a thick canopy of bright pink bougainvillea, Jinjiang Tea Room has been slinging out hearty dishes for over a decade. The term “tea house” is a misnomer; Jinjiang is a full-service restaurant dedicated to Hakka cuisine—the fare of a Han Chinese subgroup known for its emphasis on salty and smoked meats and a love of pickles. 

Situated in an 80-something-year-old house dating back to the Japanese colonial occupation of Taiwan, the restaurant is a quaint cottage in a forest of skyscrapers. The inside is just as charming, with outdated white ceiling tiles, wooden tables, and shelves stuffed with cute knick-knacks and miscellaneous clutter. 

The food is as wholesome as the decor. They do cold poached chicken—the skin crisp and gelatinous—served with a kumquat dipping sauce. There’s a lovely salted pork, sliced into bite-sized pieces, which pairs especially well with a hot bowl of short-grain rice dressed with soy  sauce-flavored lard.

The tender shoots of bird’s nest ferns are sauteed with the pickled seeds of a bird lime tree. There’s slippery noodles made with green tea, and thick belts of rice noodles with minced pork. Dessert is complimentary—usually a bowl of grass jelly, a mint-like herb beloved among the Hakka in Taiwan, or small mochi balls dressed with sweet ground peanuts. 

For the full experience, finish off with lei cha, a ground tea made with pounded grains. It’s akin to matcha, but less vegetal and more toasted and nutty.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some 1,000 years ago, the Normans pushed north attempting to subjugate part of Westmorland. As part of this effort, Castle Howe was built. Kendal’s undisputed first castle, Castle Howe, was built in 1092 and overlooks the town.

The fortifications consist of a well-defined motte, rising to around 33 feet and measuring around 59 feet in diameter at the summit. The base of the motte measures around 150 feet, and is surrounded by ditches and embankments. The bailey lays to the east of the motte, and is roughly triangular in shape, and was turned into a bowling green and is now a public park.

The Barony of Kendal fell at the hands of Ivo de Taillebois around 1092 and as a reward for his unfailing military support and success, Ivo was granted the Barony of Kentdale, a title that brought with it huge swathes of land in what is now Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria.

Kendal Castle, to the east of the earthworks, was probably built while Castle Howe was still being used. Likely, Castle Howe was the baronial center of Kirkland, and Kendal Castle was the baronial center of Kentdale. Castle Howe eventually became redundant, as did the Kendal Castle, and the administrative center of Kendal moved to the Moot Hall in the center of town.

In 1788, to celebrate the centenary of the revolution of 1688, an obelisk was erected on the summit of Castle Howe. The monument was designed by architect Francis Webster who was a native of Kendal.]]></summary>

The district of Hansaviertel was a rich urban neighborhood, and quite desirable thanks to its proximity to the city center while being right next to Tiergarten Park. But after the Second World War, it was almost completely leveled.

East Berlin had been rebuilding over the 50s, courtesy of its new socialist government and the West didn’t want to be left behind. To show that they were a new free and capitalist society, they also decided to rebuild, and the destroyed district of Hansaviertel proved to be an ideal location.

More than 50 architects were invited to work on the project, German and international alike. There were some famous names in the group, including Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer, the designer of the new Brazilian capital. Each presented their own future vision of housing.

The district contains a school, a kindergarten, a shopping center with a library and a theatre, and even an academy of arts. Additionally, every house has some special spin. They usually have descriptions on the ground floor somewhere, though a guide can be bought at the shopping center at a club made for this district]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world has seen many unique methods aimed at increasing road safety, from traffic control towers to roadside sentries. In Miyakojima, the local traffic safety association tried a slightly new way back in the 1990s, when five policemen-like figurines were set up at various crossings around the island. These were known as Mamoru-kun patrolmen. 

As the story goes, Mamoru-kun was born on August 5, 1991. He stands 180 centimeters tall, and his official titles are "Miyakojima Safety Association Staff" and "Miyakojima Police Transportation Division Officer."

Over the years there have been more figurines set up all over the island. Currently you can find 20 Mamoru-kun in various places in Miyakojima. Nineteen of these patrolmen are male, but at the Miyakojima Police Station, you can also find his female colleague Maruko-chan.

Thanks to their loyal service in all weather conditions, Mamoru-kun was also given a special Miyakojima residence permit by Mayor Toshihiko Shimoji in a ceremony back in 2012.

Originally these figurines were considered kimo (creepy), but recently Mamoru-kun have got their own fanbase. With their popularity rising, you can now also find Mamoru-kun cookies, soft drinks, and more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyday on the sides of streets across Japan, from major urban intersections to sleepy rural roads, stand young children, poised to dash out into traffic. But Tobita-kun, the name by which the children are commonly known, never actually makes it out onto the road. These “children” are, in fact, a style of wooden sign that for the last half-century has served as a warning to the nation’s drivers to watch for flesh-and-blood children who may unexpectedly dart into traffic, particularly in school zones. Often charmingly handmade by local councils, Tobita-kun has become an icon on Japan’s roadways—and played a role in revolutionizing road safety in the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the third meeting of the Moriyama City Firefly Forest Museum’s eight-week Firefly Course, a conservation training program for adults, egg collection begins. Each female Genji firefly, Nipponoluciola cruciata, can lay up to 500 of the caviar-like orbs, carefully depositing them across the mossy banks of rivers and streams in blankets of pale yellow.

In the wild, only a tiny fraction of the eggs survive. River pollution, flood prevention measures, overfishing, and excess urban light devastated the insect’s population in the 20th century. But at the museum, artificial breeding and rearing methods will coax 30,000 Genji fireflies into larvae, a phase in which they live like tiny, voracious underwater explorers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rather than driving through a tunnel beneath the Alps, this pass offers unparalleled views as you traverse over the mountains. The scenic route connects Val-Cenis in Western France with Susa in Italy, and was one of the most well-traveled paths through the Alps during the Middle Ages. The road will take a few hours to traverse, but the views and sights along the way are well worth it. 

Some scholars believe that this is the exact pass that Hannibal took with his army and war elephants in 218 BC. More than a millennia later, in 1414, Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara took this route back to Italy after meeting Charles VI in Paris. Niccolò described the pass as having "a good ascent and bad descent." Pilgrims have also taken this route on the way to Rome and the Vatican for centuries.

Eventually, Napoleon built a road on the old pilgrimage trail sometime in the early 19th century. In 1871, a railroad tunnel known as Frejus Tunnel was constructed some 30 miles away. The tunnel connected Mondane, France with Bardonecchia, Italy. It was one of the first tunnels of its kind and exhibited a remarkable feat of engineering for the time. Today, the tunnel is still one of the largest railroad tunnels in the world measuring some eight miles long. The road is also has been used as part of the Tour de France.

At the top of the pass, alongside an icy blue lake known as Lac du Mont Cenis, statues of Hannibal's elephants line the trail. The building of a dam created the artificial lake in 1921. The dam, today, feeds two hydroelectric power plants. The lake occasionally empties for maintenance. 

At the top of the pass, as you look out over the lake, you'll find a very quirky chapel. Built in 1967, the chapel is shaped like a pyramid and is made of concrete. Today it also houses a museum about the history of this region and is one of the highest museums in Europe. Other nearby sights include a botanical garden and multiple fortifications.]]></summary>

Located in his family's backyard, Linamnam (which means “delicious” in Tagalog) was opened in 2018 when Baldosano was still in his teens; fresh from competing on the TV show Junior MasterChef Pinoy Edition and a traineeship at Manila’s esteemed Toyo Eatery.

Linamnam opened its doors to the public in August 2018, offering a warm setting that puts the spotlight on the chef's bold dishes. The main dining room is a bahay kubo, a traditional thatched-roof, stilt house built on stilts typical to the Filipino lowland countryside. Built by Baldosano’s father, it offers an al fresco space adjacent to the chef‘s own childhood bedroom. …]]></summary>

Their models are sophisticated, and give a full spectrum in every direction from the surface patch. Thus we can integrate a set of patches into a surrogate combined spectrum for one rotating star covered in convecting patches. We discussed how we might do that, technically, and what projects we might then do with the output. What I want to do (yes, you guessed it) is build data-driven models of stellar granulation to improve radial-velocity surveys.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine Bagels, a family-owned establishment, has been delighting Berliners with their authentic New York-style bagels since 2013. Laurel Kratochvila’s bagel journey dates back to 1897 when her great-great grandfather, Hyman Cooper, declared that he was moving to New York City for one simple reason: “The bagels are better.” Although he ended up in Boston, running a fix-it shop, his declaration set the stage for four generations of bagel devotion within the family.

What began as a small addition to the English-language bookstore Shakespeare and Sons has become a destination in its own right. Laurel brought her family recipes to Berlin, recreating the authentic homemade bagels she missed from her New York roots. Her partner, Roman, who owns other bookstores in the Czech Republic and worked at the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, complements the culinary experience with an extensive collection of English and some French books.

Bagels are hand-rolled daily in small batches. Overnight proofing, rapid boiling, and hot baking process lend to an old-fashioned flavor across varieties from poppyseed to cinnamon raisin and rosemary sea salt. A variety of homemade schmears and toppings, including sandwich options with lox and whitefish salad, keeps the bagel game interesting for a dedicated legion of regular customers.]]></summary>

In 1974, the Mauritius kestrel—a photogenic bird with a speckled white breast and a vibrant red back and crown—came frighteningly close to extinction. Only four individuals remained. Thanks to decades of captive breeding on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the kestrel population climbed to 1,000 birds. Half a century later, as their numbers once again decline, another species is helping the charismatic raptors hang on: the traveler’s tree, a palmlike plant in the genus Ravenala.

But traveler’s trees are invasive to Mauritius and are causing problems for other native species in the ecosystem. Conservationists are now faced w…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As cities grow, they tend to swallow and overtake smaller towns that were once situated well outside. Often this leads to a loss of the local identity, unless the former towns fight back. Weil am Rhein did this in a very creative way by building giant chairs.

The town is situated just over the German border, not far from Dreiländereck, where the borders of Germany, France, and Switzerland meet. It used to be completely separate from Basel, but as both cities grew, their borders started touching more and more, to the point where many people started thinking that Weil am Rhein was the German part of Basel.

People in Weil am Rhein disliked this and decided that they needed a new and separate identity from Basel. They decided that giant chairs were the key. Large chairs started appearing all over the town, not only on the ground but also on top of buildings. Most of them are made in a way that makes them climbable.

In the 1970s, a local artist and architect named Lassù burned chairs as an art form. He built a large concrete chair on top of a pyramid to allow for recurrent burnings.

Furniture is a big bar of the history of Weil am Rhein. The town is home to the headquarters of the Vitra Corporation, one of the largest manufacturers of designer furniture in Europe. The company operates the Vitra Design Museum, which explores the history of furniture and interior design. Its collection includes several historically significant chairs, including Eero Saarinen's Tulip Chair, Charles and Ray Eames' iconic Lounge Chair, and many more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Petroglyph Beach is a remarkable site located in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, a scenic park that stretches across Arizona and Utah. Petroglyph Beach stands out as an archaeological treasure and offers visitors a glimpse into the rich history of the region.

Situated on the edge of the Colorado River, Petroglyph Beach is named for the numerous petroglyphs found etched into the walls of Glen Canyon. Petroglyphs are ancient rock carvings made by ancient Native Americans who inhabited the area centuries ago. These carvings depict various symbols, animals, and scenes that hold significant cultural and spiritual meaning.

The beach itself is a serene and tranquil spot where visitors can relax and enjoy the picturesque surroundings before continuing down the river.  Exploring Petroglyph Beach offers a unique opportunity to connect with the past and appreciate the artistic expressions of the indigenous people who once thrived in the region. The petroglyphs provide a glimpse into their daily lives, beliefs, and experiences. Visitors can spend hours examining the intricate carvings and pondering the stories they tell.

It's important to note that Petroglyph Beach is a protected site, and visitors are encouraged to treat it with respect and care. It is essential to avoid touching or damaging the petroglyphs to preserve them for future generations. Many sites within the National Park Service have specific guidelines and regulations in place to ensure their preservation, so it's advisable to follow any posted instructions.]]></summary>

I’ve always found it interesting how fictional food makes its way into the real world. A few years back, I wrote an article about how fantasy-novel food is a cuisine unto itself, and I still regret that I was abroad both times that Denny’s had an official Hobbit menu.
  A few weeks ago, I was reminded of the existence of another fictional culinary genre: anime food. Over the last few decades, Japanese animation and manga has had a huge influence on global fashion, film, music, and art. I would argue that it’s also familiarized people around the world with Japan’s popular and regional foods.

These round holes that can be found near the entrance of several buildings in the old town confuse many people. Some think that they are some kind of umbrella stand, or maybe a place for cannon balls. However, their use is much more utilitarian. They were there to help put out torches before one would enter an enclosed and flammable building. 

The easiest to find an example of these sockets is the market hall entrance on the old square, where they line the main gate entrance. But many more examples can be found.]]></summary>

Slater grew up in Cocoa Beach and learned to surf all along the Space Coast.

Slater has won 11 world titles and is a point of pride in the Space Coast community. Slater is widely regarded as the greatest professional surfer of all time and holds 56 Championship Tour victories.

Shibam, the city known for the high concentration of high-rise mud buildings, is a mere 20 kilometers away. While Seiyun may not have the iconic status that its neighboring city enjoys, it is home to one of the largest mud buildings in the world: the Sultan Al Kathiri Palace (aka Seyun Palace). This seven-story palace boasts a total of 45 rooms. Under the white coating is a structure built according to ancient mud-building techniques. 

Although a much more ancient military structure existed on this site, the construction of the Sultan Al Kathiri Palace as it has survived into the 21st century was completed in the 1920s. The appellation Kathiri refers to the Sultanate of Kathiri, which began ruling this part of Hadhramaut in …]]></summary>

Mazes have existed for thousands of years and might be thought of as the very first puzzles in the world; based on the number of people who’ve likely solved them over the years, they might be the most popular form ever. So it is natural that many puzzle creators, including the readers of Puzzle Communication Nikoli, Japan’s influential, reader-driven puzzle magazine, would try to adapt them to the style of grid puzzle that the publication made famous.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spread over 80 square meters and surrounded by meadows, Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns seem so out of place that for a long time, these columns were thought to have been the floor of a church that no longer exists. This belief was not completely implausible, considering that the first settlers on the island were probably Irish Hermits.  If this had been the case, they would most likely have built a church. These are all conjectures, but even if proven true, it is now clear that Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns was definitely not a human creation, but a natural one.

Like basalt columns elsewhere in the world, those in Kirkjugólf are the product of lava cooling. As lava cools, it contracts, and as it contracts, it cracks. The cracks start at the very bottom of the lava field and travel vertically to the top, a process that results in the creation of columns. Sharp contours and repetitive patterns make these sites seem like they were sculpted by a human hand.   

Descriptions of the Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns often report that they consist of hexagonal columns, but even this detail is misleading, for there is no shortage of pentagons, heptagons, and octagons. Yet, in spite of the variety of shapes (or more likely because of it), these columns fit in perfectly next to one another, leaving only a narrow, consistent gap between them.

Of note, the nearby village of Kirkjugólf was named after the basalt columns, and it literally means “the church floor.”  Following the discovery of its natural origins, the basalt columns were given the less-imaginative name of “Kirkjugólf Natural Monument.”]]></summary>

Despite its relatively short career, the Arizona was present for several notable events and today the battleship is memorialized within the Capitol building of its namesake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fairplay, Colorado started as a mining camp under the name of South Park City. In the 19th century, "park” was a common term in the Western United States for a wide valley, and Fairplay is located in South Park. (The animated sitcom is set in the same area.) Hence, this re-creation of a late 19th-century camp at the edge of modern Fairplay uses the original name. It consists of some 44 period buildings, seven of which are original. The rest were moved in from other old mining towns in the area. 

The buildings include mock-ups of businesses typical in a settlement like this, including a blacksmith shop, livery stable, hotel, dry goods store, drugstore, carpenter shop (which doubled as a funeral parlor), assay office, print shop, and so on. There are also living quarters, a church, a school, and even a mine and a locomotive. Contemporary equipment such as mining tools, carriages, and wagons are also extensively displayed.

Unpaved streets run between the buildings, some with authentic boardwalks, and you can wander around as much you wish. Sometimes exhibitions of 19th-century trades such as blacksmithing are also presented.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gaby Contardo (SISSA) completed her visit to Heidelberg today. Over coffee this morning she delivered a very simple, but very nice insight about machine learning outputs. Apologies that this is very Inside Baseball:
As I like to emphasize, you can't really average (or do any populations inferences with) a collection of labels delivered by a discriminative ML method run on a collection of objects. Think: Finding the mean age of a cluster, where each star in the cluster got an age estimate from a discriminative ML method trained on stars with known ages. This is because the discriminative ML methods output something very akin to posterior quantities, and if you average a bunch of posterior estimates, you are multiplying in a prior times itself many times; eventually the prior dominates the inference (in many cases).
Contardo's point: If what you want is a label for a collection of objects, like that mean age, you should train on . That is, make a training set where you have sets of N stars, labeled by mean age. Then this model can be applied to a new collection of stars and deliver a mean age estimate! Haha, brilliant. And correct. And consistent with the rules of inference.collections of objects]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden River Cave is wonderful and unique because of the tremendous amount of history associated with it. John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, stopped by for a visit in 1867 and detailed his experience in his 1916 book Thousand Mile Walk To The Gulf. The cave was once a source of drinking water and hydroelectricity for the City of Horse Cave and the remnants of the equipment are still visible during the cave tour. 

Electricity generated from the cave stream powered the home above the cave, which included a dentist's office and two other buildings in town. Horse Cave was actually the first town in Kentucky to have incandescent lights. The cave operated for commercial tours from 1916-1943, until household waste from businesses and the community above polluted the cave streams.

The cave remained closed until 1992, when the combined efforts of local leaders and the nonprofit American Cave Conservation Association (ACCA) joined forces to clean up and restore the subterranean site. A regional sewage treatment system went online in 1989, which stopped pollution from entering the cave. This allowed nature to take its course and Hidden River Cave is now considered to be an environmental success story. The ACCA also opened the American Cave Museum in the entrance to the cave in 1992.

Today, tour guides explain Hidden River Cave’s history and general information about caves, the animals that inhabit them, and some of the uses of caves. This tour is not only entertaining, it is educational.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opened in December 2022, Babka & Krantz bears the distinction of being the only Jewish bakery in Berlin’s 750-year-old bakers' guild, or the Bäcker-Innung Berlin. Being accepted into the prestigious association is no easy feat. Certain standards for craftsmanship and quality, as well as a commitment to upholding traditional baking techniques, must be met by every bakery to be approved. Plus, Germany has stringent regulations for becoming a certified baker including formal education and vocational training.

The concept here revolves around a fusion of Eastern European and Israeli cuisines, with a focus on traditional Jewish pastries. Owners Marcin Liera-Elkin and Shahar Elkin dole out their favorite sweet and savory pastries, including two versions of braided bread inspiring the shop’s name: babka baked according to Marcin’s Polish grandmother recipe, as well as krantz from Shahar’s homeland Israel.

Over 90 percent of the baked goods are made using organic ingredients, and the house-made yeast dough is allowed to rest for up to 48 hours. The bakery's warm and inviting atmosphere, coupled with delectable offerings, has made it a popular haven in the capital’s up-and-coming Friedenau neighborhood. It’s the perfect place to spend a couple of hours sipping coffee and savoring a sweet hazelnut babka with creamy nougat cream or a savory Sabich bagel, seasoned with zaatar and topped with aubergine and hummus, are definite favorites.

The inclusion of Babka & Krantz as the first Jewish bakery in the guild is a remarkable milestone, highlighting the evolving nature of Berlin's gastronomic landscape and the celebration of diverse cultural influences within the city's vibrant food scene. The bakery has become an integral part of Berlin’s steadily growing Jewish community, particularly among Israeli expats (by some figures, more than 10,000 have moved to Berlin in the last decade). It's a testament to the power of good food and the importance of preserving culinary traditions for future generations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Southern Utah has spectacular scenery, but for pioneers trying to carry out agriculture in these arid lands an adequate water supply was an ongoing problem.

This led to some extraordinary water diversion projects, including the Tropic Ditch. Water was diverted from the East Fork of the Sevier River, atop the Paunsaugunt Plateau west of the present location of Bryce Canyon National Park, to Bryce Valley. Construction began in 1890 and the Ditch was completed in 1892. It was built entirely with muscle power, using hand tools and draft animals. It extends easterly some 10 miles to the town of Tropic, which relies on its water to this day.

To minimize excavation, a critical consideration with no earth-moving equipment, natural watercourses were used as much as possible. In particular, an ordinarily dry east-draining watercourse, now called Water Canyon, became a major part of the ditch. Water Canyon crosses what is now Bryce Canyon National Park, but is still in use as it was grandfathered in when the Park was created.]]></summary>

I've been playing soccer my whole life. I played competitively from when I was seven years old until I graduated high school. Mostly, though, I just remember being bad at it. I remember I played for the brown or blue team, and we were the worst team. I always wanted to be on the black team. The black team was really good and I was never allowed on it.

But then, in middle school, that all changed. I still wasn’t the best soccer player, but I became obsessed with the game. More specifically, I became obsessed with London’s Chelsea Football Club.

An Exclusive Look at the Los Alamos Lab Where Oppenheimer Created the Bomb

by Jennie Rothenberg Gritz, Smithsonian Magazine

Los Alamos, New Mexico, is still an active national laboratory, and the sites where Manhattan Project scientists developed the first nuclear weapon remain off limits to the public. But photographer Minesh Bacrania, a physicist who worked in the lab’s nonproliferation division from 2006 to 2012, received special permission to take photographs for Smithsonian Magazine, providing a never-before-seen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Loupin' Stanes is a stone circle sat on a low platform above the River Esk. The rough stone circle has two large stones marking the entrance at the southwest side. The rest of the stone circle is made up of 10 stones.

There are also stones scattered around the exterior of the stone circle, their role in the site is uncertain. Further along, the Esk are the remains of another stone circle, Girdle Stanes. Girdle Stanes was once made up of 40 or 45 stones, over time, the Esk has changed course and it swept away part of the stone circle. Around 21 stones remain in place, one precariously balanced beyond the fence on the edge of the river bank.

It's thought that the entrance would have been located on the southeast side. The proximity of the two circles is unusual. Questions remain about why two such different style circles were built so close together. It's uncertain which was built first, although one belief is that Loupin' Stanes was built to replace Girdle Stanes after it was damaged.

There are also two recumbent stones between the two stone circles. Questions also remain about their purpose, were they some way of connecting the damaged stone circle with the smaller circle.]]></summary>

He has arc images from each night, and line lists for the arc lamps. But before even using the arc lamps, I recommended that he try to find a model for the 2D images that is an outer product of 1D functions: One is the intensity as a function of wavelength from the arc lamp, and the other is the intensity as a function of slit position from the fibers on the slithead.
The thing we realized in the call is that the coordinate system is right when the image is well described as the outer product of these two functions, warped according to that coordinate system! Okay that's nice, now what will the residuals look like? One issue is that there are cosmic rays, hot pixels, and so on. Another issue is that there will be some vignetting that violates the strict outer-product model. We'll address these issues once we get close.]]></summary>

As one steps into the establishment, one is instantly transported a hundred years back in time. Vaidya Upahar Gruha has been serving patrons delicious food since 1912. The atmospheric interior drips with vintage charm in the form of marble-topped tables decorated with artistic ironwork, antique mirrors, and classical old paintings adorning the walls.

The menu remains largely unchanged since the 1960s. Even today, the owners continue to serve their signature dishes which they have perfected over the decades. Misal pav, a traditional Maharashtrian bean curry, is their best-selling dish and they have their own version of it, which has delighted patrons time and again. Their other victuals include pohe, sabudana khichadi, bhaji, kharvas, all of which are made from scratch with care.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Japan, shopping streets that run towards major shrines or temples are quite common and often known as omote-sandō or nakamise. Quaint and busy, they typically boast a number of souvenir shops, teahouses, and restaurants, some of which may be more than a century old.

Even on such streets, international chains such as McDonald’s and Starbucks are not uncommon. But some of their outlets, such as the Ninenzaka location in Kyoto, go the extra mile to fit into the area, incorporating unique designs. Such Starbucks outlets are officially called Regional Landmark Stores and currently 28 of them exist across Japan (out of 1,800-odd locations).

The Dazaifu Tenmangu Omote-Sando location, however, stands out with its striking modernist design. Jutting out of its façade is an interwoven web of cedar timber, slotted together diagonally and leading visitors into the dreamlike interior.

Designed by renowned architect Kengo Kuma, the bizarre lattice was made using a traditional method of Japanese architecture called kigumi. By slotting cut pieces of wood together, it can create the framework and keep it solid without the use of nails, making the structure especially durable and resistant to rust.

Natural and soothing, the creamy brown timber seems to radiate illumination all by itself… and it does. Almost. Some of the lights are actually embedded in the tip of the wood, such as those hanging above the counter.

In addition to the lighting, Kuma also took charge of the interior design down to the smallest detail, from the miniature garden at the entrance to the comfortability of the couches. At the back behind a glass wall is another garden, where a plum tree—the symbol of Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine—stands, also doubling as a smoking area.]]></summary>

Barbie cakes have been a special birthday request for decades. Instead of a standard sheet cake, bakers frost a dome-shaped layer to resemble a giant ballgown skirt. A Barbie doll is then inserted into the top and iced with a matching blouse to complement the rest of her sweet outfit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mexico City is known for its number of museums. Many residents of the city and Mexicans in general, actually believe it to be the city with the most museums in the world. Most serious attempts at counting city museums seem to provide widely varying results, depending on membership to organizations, definitions of what counts as a museum, and city limits. However, the top three spots consistently seem to be contested between Paris, Moscow, and London, with Mexico City often appearing in the top 10. Among such museo-graphical wealth, some spaces need to offer something that makes them stand out.

The Photography Archive Museum isn't even the city's only museum dedicated exclusively to photography, so in order to draw in visitors, it offers heavily-themed exhibits. In early 2022 for example, pictures showcasing Mexico City markets were enhanced with piñatas, dried herbs, kitchen supplies, and many of the other items one would find for sale in these spaces.

Since its opening in 2006, in a 16th-century building known as Las Casa de las Ajaracas (House of Ajaracas, after the architectural features that define its facade), the museum has showcased several exhibitions with added features as varied as the reproduction of a dark room, a collection of bicycles, and others. In addition to the displays, as its name says, the museum houses a significant archive with more than two million pictures.]]></summary>

Despite the Russian defeat, the British army was impressed by the redan field fortifications used by Russian forces. A redan is a V-shaped fortification that faces an enemy's expected attack. The British army took note of the effectiveness of the fortifications and decided to construct a replica in Aldershot's military town, just north of the town's center.

Greenhead, a town previously known for its wildflowers and pristine beaches, is now abuzz with an international mystery. Theories about the identity of the object have raged on the internet—from a piece of a passing ship, to a pressurized tank, to a part of Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which went missing over the Indian Ocean in 2014.

The encrusted object is now being held in a secure storage facility for further investigation. The Australian Space Agency subsequently tweeted: “The object could be from a foreign space launch vehicle and we are liaising with global counterparts who may be able to provide more information.”

The rocky surfaces that surround him radiate heat, in some places enough to burn unprotected skin. With every step he takes, the temperature rises. But Fernández Lorenzo, vice president of the Canary Federation of Speleology, is not worried about the discomfort. He wants to see a place that no human has seen before.

Not long ago, lava raced through this cave on La Palma, in the Spanish Canary Islands. Over nearly 86 days, starting in September 2021, an eruption pumped some 200 million cubic meters of lava from a fissure near the peak of the Cumbre Vieja ridge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the central Piazza Garibaldi is the Governor's Palace, the original building of which dates back to the 13th century. After undergoing numerous changes, its present form dates back to the second half of the 18th century. If you look carefully at the part of the palace on the corner of Via Cavour, you will notice the sample of the "Parmesan brick," the ancient unit of measurement of Parmesan builders, embedded and framed in the wall.

It measures approximately 28 centimeters long, 12 centimeters wide, and 5.6 centimeters thick. The brick measure, displayed in antiquity by the kilnsmen, served to prevent the placing on the market of dwindling sizes and the resulting fraud.

The ancient Italian units of measurement were local units in use throughout the centuries in different parts of Italy. Although they often had similar names, they had very different origins and values. As early as the 11th century, the different local realities realized their own units of measurement. Over time, boundary changes led to heterogeneous units of measurement being brought together under the same administration with obvious problems for duties, taxation, and trade. Rare and not very fruitful were some attempts at unifying units of measurement, for which it would be necessary to wait until the 19th century, when local units of measurement were gradually replaced by the metric system.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden behind a wall, which feels like a prison yard, a striking memorial attempts to commemorate and give a brief timeline of the events leading up to 19 men being hanged as Molly Maguires between 1877 and 1879 in the Pennsylvania coal region.

The bronze statue was created by Zenos Frudakis and erected in 2009 in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. The imagery of the statue is of an anonymous man with his hands and feet both bound by rope and a hood over his head, as he waits for the gallows.

Molly Maguires were Irish immigrants that worked in the anthracite mines in Schuylkill, Carbon, Luzerne, Columbia, and Northumberland Counties in Pennsylvania. At least 19 miners were hanged between 1877 and 1879 for crimes associated with the Molly Maguires group, who were fighting with mine owners for basic living rights. 
The miners at the time were treated poorly, with low wages and awful working conditions. The miners felt they were being taken advantage of and exploited by the mine owners, and formed the Molly McGuires. (The name comes from early 19th-century Ireland, when a woman named Molly Maguire protested against English landlords who tried to steal people's land.)
 Both sides during this conflict resorted to violence, with many people dying on both sides from murders to suspicious deaths to dynamiting of mines to close the mines so that the mine owners lost money. Both sides blamed the other side whenever anything went wrong, and would fight back with violence. 
 Chronologically, the trials of the Molly McGuires ended on January 14, 1879, when Martin Bergin, the 19th Molly was executed and hung in Pottsville for the murder of Patrick Burns. 
 The monument pays tribute to all the miners that lost their lives during this time, there is a black plaque dedicated to them with their names inscribed. The dedication marker lists "Sir Sean Connery" as chairman of the advisory committee. Connery played the lead role in the fictional movie, The Molly Maguires.]]></summary>

We have some candidates, which range in temperature from 300 to 1500 K and are reprocessing maybe one percent or a fraction of a percent of the stellar light.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The southern Reveille Range, west of Nevada State Route 375, the famed Extraterrestrial Highway, is unusual among Nevada mountain ranges in containing no potential economic mineralization. No doubt, prospectors swarmed over the area back in the day, but they found nothing to warrant further effort. The result is that this area is not seamed with roads and jeep trails connecting adits, prospect pits, abandoned buildings, spoil heaps, and other mining residua. The southern Reveille Range is an almost untouched piece of nature. 

A highlight of the range is Fang Ridge, a ridge of red rock spires running east to west, perpendicular to the main range. The "fangs" are composed of dacite, a hard volcanic rock, which is sturdy enough to attract nearby rock climbers. The fangs reach an elevation of some 6,000 feet above sea level.

The only road into the south Reveille Range runs along the south side of Fang Ridge, which provides easy access to the pristine landscape. This road runs by Pyramid Spring, one of the handful of perennial water sources in the range, and continues for another half mile. It ends at a wide parking area below the ridge. The site was used for radiation monitoring back when nuclear testing was being carried out on the Nevada Test Site to the south.]]></summary>

"We do not ask you to go there for the purpose of making sensational revelations. Write up things as you find them, good or bad; give praise or blame as you think best, and the truth all the time. But I am afraid of that chronic smile of yours," her editor told her, as recorded in the 35,000-word exposé, Ten Days In a Mad-House. "I will smile no more," replied Bly. 

Bly, who went undercover as Nellie Brown, found much to "give blame." Bly spent a total of 10 days in the asylum on Blackwell’s Island in New York’s East River, now known as Roosevelt Island, and before that as Minnehanonck among Indigenous Lenape people. …]]></summary>

In this episode of The Atlas Obscura Podcast, we visit an infamous break in the road that links North and South America. The Darién Gap has been in and out the news for more than 100 years—and for good reason. This stretch of jungle has been a magnet for adventure junkies, but also is the site of a growing humanitarian and migration crisis.

Here's more information about the current situation around the Darién Gap, plus ways to help.

 

Our podcast is an audio guide to the world’s wondrous, awe-inspiring, strange places. In under 15 minutes, we’ll take you to an incredible site, and along the way you’ll meet some fascinating people and hear their stories. Join us daily, Monday through Thursday, to explore a new wonder with cofounder Dylan Thuras and a neighborhood of Atlas Obscura reporters.]]></summary>

In the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, crocodiles sunbathe along the muddy banks that line the steep cliffs of Sumidero Canyon. On the small, rural island of Tashirojima, off the coast of eastern Japan, cats lounge peacefully as waves tickle the shore of “Cat Island.” From June to September in Manitoba, some 3,000 beluga whales sing and swim their way along northern Canada’s Churchill River. With a bit of luck, you may even find yourself eye to eye with some of these incredible creatures as they’re busy migrating, raising their young, and getting their tan on during the warm summer months.

        <updated>2023-07-18T19:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the small town of Ellsworth, Maine, stands a structure that's as fascinating as it is improbable: a barn that's home to neither poultry nor livestock, but an astonishing assortment of antiques and books. The Big Chicken Barn, stretching over 21,000 square feet, is a testament to the unusual, the nostalgic, and the whimsical.

The barn's name is not a misnomer, but a nod to its history. Erected in the 1950s, the massive structure initially served as a chicken house for over 20,000 hens. Today, however, its wooden floors echo with the soft rustle of flipping pages and the murmur of intrigued visitors.

The barn's upper level teems with antiques, from vintage furniture and rustic kitchenware to historical memorabilia and quirky collectibles. Each piece tells a story, transporting the onlooker to a bygone era.

Downstairs, the barn has been transformed into a massive used bookstore, home to over 150,000 titles. It's a veritable paradise for the lover of a good tale, and an unsuspecting find. The book collection spans all genres, including rare editions and out-of-print titles that would enthrall any book hunter.

Walking through the Big Chicken Barn feels like stepping into a different world—one where time slows, objects whisper tales of the past, and the joy of discovery is around every corner. Every visit promises something new, thanks to the ever-changing inventory sourced from auctions, estate sales, and individual sellers.

Not only is the Big Chicken Barn a treasure trove for antiques and books, but it's also a testament to the magic that can occur when space is repurposed and transformed. Once a bustling hub of the poultry industry, the barn now serves as a sanctuary for lovers of history, literature, and the eclectic.

Whether you're a dedicated collector, a casual browser, or a traveler looking for an offbeat experience, the Big Chicken Barn offers an adventure in exploration. And like the best adventures, you never know what you'll find.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nicknamed the "city of ghosts," An Bang Cemetery is an impressible display of artistic construction and wealth. 
The history of An Bang Cemetery is intertwined with the emigration of residents from An Bang Village to Europe and the United States after the reunification of Vietnam in 1975. These emigrants sent money back to their relatives, making An Bang one of the wealthiest villages in the country. The affluence of the town is evident in the grand houses and neatly paved driveways seen while driving through the streets. The residents dedicate their time to constructing extravagant mausoleums within the 250-hectare cemetery, adjacent to a beautiful, empty sandy beach. 

The building of these structures began in 1995 and has since become increasingly lavish, often reaching two or three stories high. Adorned with intricate gold carvings of dragons and mythical creatures, these mausoleums even feature fully functional bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens. This lavish display reflects not only the residents' opulent lifestyle but also their strong belief in the afterlife and the importance of honoring their ancestors.

According to their beliefs, meticulously caring for and decorating the tombs will bring good fortune to the family. The cost of constructing these tombs can reach as much as £50,000 (GBP), an extraordinary amount in a country where poverty is prevalent. Visiting this unique cemetery, surrounded by towering tombs, gives a ghostly and awe-inspiring experience, allowing one to imagine the splendid kingdom where the spirits of ancestors reside.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visoki Dečani Monastery is a medieval Serbian Orthodox Christian monastery located in Kosovo. It is renowned for its historical and cultural significance, as well as its remarkable architecture and religious art.
The Visoki Dečani Monastery was built in the mid-14th century (between 1327 and 1335) by King Stefan Dečanski of Serbia. It was established as a royal endowment and served as a mausoleum for the Nemanjić dynasty. Representing the height of Serbian medieval architecture, encompassing both Byzantine and Romanesque styles with distinct Serbian elements, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2004. It represents the historical and artistic achievements of Serbia in this area.

The monastery complex consists of the main church, several chapels, monk cells, and a defensive wall. Furthermore, frescoes cover the walls and ceilings of the main church, depicting biblical scenes, saints, and the lives of Serbian rulers. The art is renowned for its vivid colors, detailed craftsmanship, and spiritual expression. It serves as a place of worship, pilgrimage, and cultural preservation, playing a vital role in maintaining the Serbian Orthodox Christian tradition.
Despite the complex political situation in the region, Visoki Dečani Monastery remains a prominent spiritual and cultural destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to admire its beauty and learn about its rich history. It is amongst the top most endangered cultural sites in Europe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reed Gold Mine is the first documented commercial gold found in the United States, triggering the first gold rush. The land was owned by John Reed, a former Hessian soldier, who fought for the British in the Revolutionary War. Reed and his family settled onto a farmstead in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, Northeast of Charlotte. 

The story of the gold discovery began in 1799 when Reed's son found a large yellow rock in a nearby creek. The rock weighed 17 pounds. Not originally recognized as gold, legend has it that the family used the rock as the doorstop for the family house. 

A nearby jeweler from Fayetteville identified the rock as gold in 1802 while visiting the home. It was purchased for a portion of its true worth. Eventually, word got out and gold was discovered in nearby creeks and land, triggering a gold rush. At its peak, the estimated value mined each year in the mine and surrounding areas topped over one million dollars, including a 28-pound gold nugget that was also found at Reed's farm.]]></summary>

On ski trips to the mountains of Uludağ, “we'd always end the cold and tiring day with a salep,” he says. Özcan, who left Turkey in 2013, is one of the many Turkish people living abroad who thirsts for salep. “I tried to quench it with eggnog a couple times, but it didn't cut it for me,” he says.

Much like eggnog, salep is a staple winter drink, and it is enjoyed throughout Turkey, Greece, and parts of the Middle East. Part comfort food and part medicine, it is a popular folk remedy for everything from stomachache to impotence.

The planting includes approximately 300 mature trees. Although beautiful at all times of the year, the grove is especially stunning in the autumn. Beginning in late October, the trees put on a spectacular display as their fan-shaped leaves turn from bright green to brilliant yellow. As the leaves fall, they carpet the grove in drifts of yellow and gold.

The genesis of the Ginkgo Grove Garden was an experiment by Dr. Orlando E. White, Blandy's first director. Because Ginkgo trees are dioecious, (either male or female), White hypothesized that a random planting of Gingko seeds would result in a 1:1 ratio of male …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Along a bustling thoroughfare in the center of Pune is the popular Mahatma Phule Museum. It was founded in 1875 and was formerly called the Poona Industrial Museum. Later it was renamed Lord Reay Industrial Museum and in 1968, it was renamed once again, this time to the Mahatma Phule Museum.

At the entrance, in the spacious courtyard, is a circle fenced with artistic pillars and a chain. Within this circle stands an imposing piece of artillery on two gigantic wheels. An information plaque describes this gun to be a 12-pound howitzer.

This type of weapon could fire cannonballs or other projectiles of 12 pounds from its barrel. According to experts, a howitzer falls between a cannon and a mortar with long-range capabilities. The plaque also mentions that this particular gun was manufactured in 1859 in Bengal (now West Bengal).]]></summary>

If one wanders just a bit farther, the community of Oro-Medonte occupies the open land between Kempenfelt Bay on Lake Simcoe and the southern tip of Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. The land in this region formed the backbone of British supply lines between the Great Lakes during the War of 1812. In the years following that conflict, the fear of a restrengthened America invading once more was considered a very real possibility.

In order to secure the main supply route between Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay, a rough-hewn path was cut through the wilderness. This route would come to be known as the Penetanguishene Road, named after the naval establishment located at its northernmost point. It was decided by the government…]]></summary>

In a building on the street that corners Via Maestri is a strange symbol that in a stylized way was meant to represent a louse. During the medieval period, it was ordered that mountaineers from the Apennine mountains, who often carried the troublesome parasite, passed through the area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The pronghorn antelope, which is not a true antelope, is unique to North America and is the sole surviving representative of a separate group of ruminants. They were hunted nearly to extinction—it's estimated that there were only about 14,000 individuals left by 1914. Due to extensive conservation efforts, the species has recovered, with around a million animals alive today.

A major factor in the pronghorn's recovery was the establishment of dedicated wildlife refuges in the early 20th century. The largest was the Sheldon Antelope Refuge in the northwest corner of Nevada next to the Oregon line. It began with the purchase of 34,000 acres at Last Chance Ranch in 1931. In 1936, President Roosevelt added over 540,000 adjacent acres of Federal lands, with the total acreage combined into a single wildlife refuge. At present, the refuge is managed in conjunction with the smaller Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge in Oregon, which was created at the same time.

The Sheldon Refuge consists of high desert steppe, including tilted tablelands and deep canyons (such as Thousand Creek Gorge, which overlaps the refuge slightly on the east side). It encloses the Virgin Valley opal mines, which were grandfathered in. Virgin Valley is also the site of the current refuge headquarters, as well as the Dufurrena Ponds, which provide waterfowl habitat and are open to fishing with a Nevada license.

The Last Chance Ranch was the original heart of the refuge, and indeed served as the headquarters in the early years. The ranch building is still preserved as a historical site.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Alexanderplatz area is a beautiful spot for looking at some of the most extravagant socialist architecture. One of the most notable buildings is a seemingly ordinary skyscraper that is wrapped in a colorful mosaic. 

The building dates from the early 1960s and was erected in place of its predecessor which was bombed during warfare. It was the first skyscraper in the area and was built to impress. Designed by the Hermann Henselmann, B. Geyer, and J. Streitparth architect collective, this 12-story high-rise was at its time Europe's most advanced center for teachers and educators—sporting a huge library behind the three-story spanning mosaic that held over 650,000 books, but also a cafe, restaurant, bar, bookshop, and cabaret. 

The mosaic itself was designed and implemented by Walter Womacka and uses a staggering 800,000 stones. The work of art is titled "Our Life" and showcases idealistic snippets of socialist life in East Germany, with a special focus on educators. The style is made in that of Mexican mural art and it is one of thelargest works of art in Europe.]]></summary>

Along with Roman artifacts from various eras, tools from the Punic and Neo-Punic traditions were discovered inside. The final period of the cemetery's habitation began at the end of the 4th century BCE.

For housing a cemetery of 98 tombs, of which more than 50 are carved in coffered rock, the holes in the ground have managed to withstand the passing of time. The necropolis is also a meeting place that enriches social coexistence—widely frequented by residents of the city and tourists that want to enjoy a fantastic view.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Shunpiking is defined as  "the act of deliberately avoiding roads that require payment of a fee or toll to travel on them, usually by traveling on alternative 'free' roads which bypass the toll."

One of the first instances in America occurred along the Mohawk Trail, in Charlemont, Massachusettes. 

A road for stagecoaches was built over the Hoosac Range in the northwestern part of the state in 1787, and the road came under the control of the Turnpike Association in 1797. That year, travelers of the Mohawk Trail forded the Deerfield River rather than pay the toll at the turnpike bridge. In 1810, they won the battle for free travel on all Massachusetts roads.

The act is memorialized by the historical marker at the Shunkpike Rest Stop. This portion of the river is now used for tubing and fishing in the warmer months.]]></summary>

The statehouse is constructed of Columbus Limestone, which was formed from sediments deposited around 390–405 million years ago during the Devonian Period when what would become Ohio was a warm, shallow sea. The corals, sponges, and shelled animals of the sea make up this limestone, and the statehouse is one of the best places for the public to view these fossils where the limestone is used for the walls. 

Crown Point Limestone, used as floor tile, was sourced from quarries in Isle La Motte, Vermont. This limestone from the Late Ordovician Period, about 459 million years old, showcases major groups of invertebrates also occurring in Columbus Limestone with the addition of marine gastropods.]]></summary>

The sabertooth cat is an Ice Age icon and emblem of strength, tenacity, and intelligence. These animals shared the North American landscape with other large carnivores, including short-faced bears, dire wolves, and the American lion, as well as megaherbivores including mammoths, mastodons, muskoxen, and long-horned bison. Then at the end of the Pleistocene, between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, they all vanished. The only place to see them now is in the fossil record.

Carnivore fossils are extremely rare, though, in comparison to those of their prey. Prey are always more abundant than predators in a healthy ecosystem. So the probability of burial, storage and discovery of carnivo…]]></summary>

When Christopher Columbus bumbled his way into the Bahamas in 1492, his crew must have been relieved—if only for a break from leathery salted beef and hardtack biscuits softened in water-flavored wine. On a later voyage, Columbus’s son Ferdinand wrote, “What with the heat and dampness, our ship biscuit had become so wormy that, God help me, I saw many who waited for darkness to eat porridge made of it, that they might not see the maggots.”

In 1519, when Ferdinand Magellan vowed to circumnavigate the Earth on a two-year voyage with five ships and 239 men, he set forth with 2,626 kilos of aged bacon, 1,547 liters of dried beans, 1,293 kilos of cheese, 140 barrels …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a conversation with Vedant Chandra (Harvard) today about how catalogs are used, and how that relates to how they are built. We started off by arguing about how principled one should be about doing a populations inference. Too abstract! So Chandra moved us in the pragmatic direction: Let's look at a very specific inference and see what matters about it. We decided to look at the distances to distant clusters in the ESA  data: How do your inferences depend on the number of stars you use, the signal-to-noise ratios of those stars, and whether your individual-star measurements are maximum-likelihood or obtained by consideration of a posterior pdf? That should answer questions, and set up some concrete points of discussion.Gaia]]></summary>

Visitors who walk up to the gate, dirt crunching under their feet, will likely encounter a dog lazing about and bougainvillea waving gently in the breeze. After passing through the 19th century–style kitchen, filled with dark-red earthenware pottery, old cookbooks, and the smell of smoke, they’ll sit beneath a tin roof and watch as women use pre-Columbian tools to make tostadas raspadas (“scraped” tostadas), grinding corn with a metate and cooking with a traditional firewood stove known as a tecuil. Everything, from the menu to the equipment to the décor, is meant to evoke the historic, nearly-forgotten traditional kitchens of Jalisco.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cristina Ortiz, the colorful Spanish media personality better known as La Veneno (“The Poison”), never called herself a role model: indeed, her autobiography is subtitled “Ni puta ni santa,” (“Neither a Whore nor a Saint”). Yet thanks to her unapologetic openness about her struggles as a trans woman (not to mention her inexhaustible repertoire of catchphrases), Ortiz has become something of a patron saint to Spain’s queer community since her death in 2016.

“Brave trans woman visible in the 90s,” reads the diamond-shaped plaque that adorns Ortiz’s monument in the West Park of Madrid, which stands in the place where she was “discovered” late one night in 1996. At the time, Ortiz was a sex worker in the park–one of the only jobs she could get, due to discrimination–when a TV reporter approa…]]></summary>

What many people might not know, however, is that the character of Peter Pan was a literary creation for adults before he became "the boy who wouldn't grow up." In 1906, the mischievous entity was featured in a book entitled Peter Pan and Kensington Gardens. This tome was comprised of a collection of short stories involving the adventures of our titular hero, taking place in the surrounding environs.

One such episode is a rather somber and macabre tale, involving two children who were lost or became abandoned, once the park's gates had closed for the evening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Zamora is famous all over Spain because of its Holy Week processions, and all of them start the moment Barandales makes his bells ring. He is the first person you see (and hear) at he start of every procession. Without this person, Zamora and its Holy Week would not be the same.

Barandales is a well-known figure in charge of signaling the approach of the several Zamora Passion processions. His distinguishing features include two large bells that hang from his wrists, which he constantly rings to alert locals and guests of the procession's approach. With his emblematic jingle, the crowd goes silent to show respect for the religious ceremony.

Being "el Barandales" is a complete honor for locals of Zamora and it used to be an hereditary position. Nowadays every cofradía (group of penitents taking part in a procession) appoints their own Barandales.

The bronze statue of Barandales is the work of sculptor Ricardo Flecha and it was made in 1994. The statue is located in the Plaza de Santa María la Nueva, in front of the Museum of Holy Week, where some of the best images of the Holy Week in Zamora can be found. Barandales statue is the homage to the fifth centenary of the foundation of the Brotherhood of the Holy Burial.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alma Woodsey Thomas was born in Columbus, Georgia, on September 22, 1891. She moved to Washington, D.C., in 1907 with her family who were seeking educational opportunities that were not as easy to come by in the South during the Jim Crow era. Thomas attended Howard University and initially studied costume design before changing course at the urging of a professor, James Vernon Herring, who entreated her to become the first student in the new art department.

After graduating in 1924 with a degree in fine arts (and perhaps the first Black woman in the country to do so), she shared her gift by becoming a teacher. She plied her trade at Shaw Jr. High from 1925 until 1960.

She remained busy during her 35 years as an educator. In 1934, she earned her master's degree from Teachers College of Columbia. Four years later, she created the first art gallery in the D.C. public school system. In 1943, she collaborated with her former professor James Herring and artist Alonzo J. Aden to create one of the first African American art galleries in the U.S., the Barnett Aden Gallery.

She returned her focus to her own art in the 1950s and developed an emphasis on color while working with other artists at American University. Concurrently, she took an interest in the Washington Color School, whose works consisted of abstract shapes of pure color.

In 1964, Thomas suffered an arthritic attack that she feared might render her unable to continue painting, but she persevered and altered her style to capture the natural beauty she saw outside her window. She continued to thrive into her 70s, and in 1972, she had exhibitions at the Whitney Gallery and the Corcoran Art Gallery.

Alma Thomas died on February 24, 1978. In 2016, almost 40 years after her passing, one of her abstract paintings from 1966 entitled Resurrection became the first painting by a Black woman to hang in the White House. Another one of Thomas's paintings, entitled Pansies In Washington, hangs in the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/donum-estate-california"/>
        <updated>2023-07-14T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From the outside, nothing seems out of the ordinary when pulling up to the front gate of the Donum Estate. As far as the eye can see, there are rows of grapes just like every other winery in Sonoma County. It's only once security opens up the gate and tells you to "stay to the right of the giant head" that the surreal atmosphere begins to creep in.

On the drive up to the main house, vineyards full of the highest-scoring pinot noirs in the world are ignored as all attention is focused on the few contemporary sculptures in sight, some blending into the California landscape much better than others. Finally, by the time you reach the end of the driveway, you aren't greeted with some grandiose Victorian mansion, but rather a quaint, 1-story Scandinavian-influenced house. This is the Donum Estate: a place where oenophilia meets modern art that is somewhat reminiscent of Bond villain's evil lair.

Founded by Allan and Mei Warburg, the Donum Estate spans around 200 acres and is home to over 50 pieces of art, heavily influenced by the couple's own ethnic backgrounds. Some of the more famous pieces include: Love Me, a giant mirrored steel heart sculpture symbolically overlooking the entire estate, and Love (Gold/Red), the iconic pop art image created by Robert Indiana that gained fame in Philadelphia's John F. Kennedy Plaza. There is also Crouching Spider, which, as you can guess, is a massive steel spider carefully tucked into an undistinguishable space to possibly get the jump on arachnophobes.

Although its fascinating art collection makes Donum quite memorable, that isn’t the only draw of the estate. What would a world-famous vineyard be without offering a wine tasting! If you are able to secure an exclusive reservation, the Donum Estate offers several different types of tastings. Just make sure to save up for the experience because it can end up being quite pricey, especially if you order a few bottles to go!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The FitzGerald Bridge, also popularly known as the Bund Garden Bridge is an important crossing over the Mula-Mutha river in Pune. Named after Sir William Robert Seymour Vesey-FitzGerald, the erstwhile Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) from 1867 to 1872, it was designed and constructed by Captain Robert S. Sellon of the Royal Engineers.

Work commenced in 1866 and was completed in 1867 at a cost of 241,800 Rupees. It was the first spandrel arch bridge in Pune and was formally opened to the public in 1869. On both sides of the bridge, there are statues of two lions looking to the side holding a sphere under a paw. These are representations of the Medici Lions at Villa Medici in Rome.

Today, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic and has been converted into an arts plaza, with seating arrangements and an open space. One can spot the iconic lions from both ends of this heritage structure. They have withstood the test of time and are the proud guardians of this slice of history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My day started with a conversation with Wolfgang Brandner (MPIA), who asked me how to figure out the information content of ESA  RVS spectra, but in a data-driven way. He wants to avoid the theoretical models at first; that is, he wants to figure out how precisely the spectra contain temperature and metallicity and age information without having temperatures, metallicities, and ages that we believe. One approach is to compare to other data that are sensitve to temperature, metallicity, and age: If the RVS spectra can predict those data, then (conditioned on assumptions) they must contain information about temperature, metallicity, and age. This is similar to questions of risk (or expected error in prediction) in machine-learning contexts.Gaia]]></summary>

The Madrid metro has made a significant effort to rehabilitate a selection of its vintage trains, which were in operation between 1919 and 1965.

In 1919, Madrid opened its first metro line from Sol to Cuatro Caminos. It was inaugurated on October 17, 1919, by King Alfonso XIII and opened to the public later that month. Some of the trains that serviced the citizens of Madrid on that very first day can be seen in this museum.

The museum is also home to around 100 subway-specific items and videos from a bygone such as old metro signs and tools.]]></summary>

This gateway opened during expansion work a few years ago at the Port of Calais, and released a huge and powerful dragon that now patrols the city’s shoreline. According to the dragon’s press, the fantastic beast is “naturally benevolent, but can also be wild and unpredictable."

So goes the story of The Calais Dragon, created by François Delarozière, one of the artists behind the intricate puppet-automatons known as the Machines of the Isle of Nantes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1834, Athens was a small city of 7,000 residents. When Athens was declared the new capital of Greece on September 18, 1834, a large building boom soon followed. A plot of land in the Makrigianni area, near the Acropolis, was selected for a military hospital. Bavarian military engineer Wilhelm von Weiler designed the building and did so in a German Neo-Romantic style. Construction began in late 1834 and was completed in 1836. The finished military hospital was three stories tall with a large basement and an exterior of coated stone masonry.

An assassination attempt on the prime minister, the death of King Alexander from a monkey bite, and territorial disputes all led to an increase in the resources needed by the Royal Gendarmerie so the building was converted to regimental barracks in 1920.

In 1944, the building fell victim to the Dekemvriana (December events), a 37-day period of fighting in the streets of Athens between British forces supporting the Greek government and communist rebels (who had fought alongside British troops against the Germans just months earlier). The building was badly damaged, with a large portion of the coating destroyed, exposing the stonework. Following the Dekemvriana, most of the remaining coating was removed and the majority of the building exterior was left as exposed stonework.

In 1978, the building was turned over to the Ministry of Culture. Use by the ministry was limited until a full renovation was completed between 1985 and 1987. After renovations were complete, the building was inaugurated by the late Minister for Culture, Melina Mercouri, as the Museum of the Center for Acropolis Studies.

The center now contains as original terracotta architectural remains from the Acropolis, a series of plaster casts depicting successive uses of the Acropolis from prehistoric Neolithic times to the 18th century, and numerous other important artifacts.]]></summary>

I spent this morning on three different small activities. One was giving feedback to Matt Daunt (NYU) who is trying to re-build the  concept for stellar radial-velocity measurement in . He has annoying optimization issues, which are very hard to diagnose! Optimization is always nasty, in my experience.wobblejax
Another activity was working on the abstract for Lily Zhao's (Flatiron) upcoming paper on stellar variability in the spectral domain, generated by rotating, spotty stars. She is concerned that the paper is too conceptual. I love conceptual papers! I think science moves forward through concepts and implentations, and no individual paper has to do it all.
My third activity this morning was working through the mathematics on a project of Abby Williams (NYU, Caltech) to measure the kinematic dipole in the all-sky  quasar catalog. There are so many different ways to measure it. I think I have a justifiable likelihood function approach, and one in which we could marginalize out—or profile out—the uncertainties in the selection function we have estimated. It's a controversial subject, so I would like to do things correctly.Quaia]]></summary>

Beneath this diversity lies one of the world’s largest gold deposits, and, beneath that, more than three miles underground, there’s a geological treasure from deep time: layers of rock that provide evidence of Earth’s earliest deep freeze.

According to a paper published recently in Geochemical Perspectives Letters, these rocks hold multiple clues to the world's oldest glaciers, sheets of ice that covered the area an astonishing 2.9 billion years ago. Now the big question is: What on Earth was the…]]></summary>

At the intersection of Julia and Magazine Streets, the Mistick Krewe of Comus kicked off Fat Tuesday with a parade that marched through the main thoroughfares of the city to the Gaiety Theatre, on Gravier Street between Carondelet and Baronne Streets.

The organized procession coalesced around a single theme, “The Demon Actors in Milton’s Paradise Lost," and featured classic characters from Paradise Lost, such as Pluto and Prosperine, the Fates, fairies, harpies, gorgons, Satan, Isis, Osiris, and many others. Once the parade reached the Gaiety Theatre, members presented four tableaus taken from Paradise Lost: Tartarus, the Expulsion, the conference of Satan and Bee…]]></summary>

A collection of immigrants, Black Americans from the South, and other residents of the various hallows located around the state joined forces to stand up against the mine guard system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since their introduction in the mid-19th century, music boxes have been a very popular novelty in Japan, where they are called orugōru from Dutch Orgel "organ." They are commonly found among the usual souvenirs at tourist gift shops, coming in many shapes and sizes.

Established in 1967 and headquartered in the northern city of Otaru, the Orgel-Doh company is known as one of the largest music box manufacturers in Japan. Its main outlet, dubbed the Otaru Orgel Museum, boasts thousands of items for sale as well as small exhibits of European antiques, automata, and dioramas depicting the history of music boxes.

The "museum" is housed in a huge, three-story brick building built in 1912 as a rice merchant's storehouse, a historic monument worth seeing on its own. Inside, spacious halls with quaint wooden beams and dazzling chandeliers gleam with a multitude of music boxes, many of them lushly decorated. Some are of more traditional kinds, from snow globes to piano-shaped antimony chests in Rococo style, while others are uniquely designed in the forms of princesses, teddy bears, Chinese Zodiac animals, Ferris wheels, and even sushi.

Up on the second floor runs an elegant, lamp-lit corridor with historical exhibits and antique, luxury music boxes such as the Orpheus and the Reuge, as well as a section where local handicrafts are showcased. The third floor is home to a nostalgic attic called The Sound of Dreams, focusing on character-themed music boxes and stationery items, particularly those of Studio Ghibli and Monchchichi.

When visiting, don't forget to take a picture with the icon standing in front of the building: the world's largest steam clock. Made in 1994 by Canadian clockmaker Raymond Saunders, credited as the creator of the world's first steam clock in Gastown, the Otaru Steam Clock is 18 feet tall and plays a five-note melody every 15 minutes, exhaling steam into the air.]]></summary>

It was replaced by a nearby church on Church Lane, which fell into disrepair when the village relocated to higher ground. The lynch gate is Grade II listed. The church happens to be only one of three Art Nouveau churches in England and is the best preserved of the trio.

Its interior is decorated with Art Nouveau and Arts & Crafts styles using mother-of-pearl, walnut, marble, aluminum, and other materials. The designer was Sir William Reynolds-Stevens.

Nearby is Warley Place, which was once the home of Victorian gardener Ellen Willmott. The house no longer exists, but the estate (which includes the former garden) is now a nature reserve run by the Essex Wildlife Trust. Warley Place is free to visit.]]></summary>

Each is made from scrap materials, mostly metal, which was sourced from junkyards and scrap piles. Over the years, the Gerhkes created nearly 800 of these wind sculptures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federico Rubio y Galí was a prominent physician who not only went down in history for his medical discoveries but also his intense involvement in politics and literature. He founded the first Professional School of Nursing in Spain in 1896 and was elected a member of the prestigious Royal College of Surgery in London and the Royal Spanish Academy of Medicine.

His monument, located in Parque del Oeste, is made of white limestone and bronze. It is the work of the Catalan sculptor Miguel Blay Fábregas. The inauguration was carried out by King Alfonso XIII, four years after the death of the doctor in December 1906.

During the Spanish Civil War, the monument was the target of intense crossfire. The fight between Parque del Oeste and the entire campus of Ciudad Universitaria was long and cruel. The monument to Federico Rubio y Galí ended up decapitated by a cannon projectile and pierced by hundreds of bullets.

After the war, the monument was somehow "pardoned," despite the doctor's Republican background, and later rebuilt and left as it is seen today, keeping the bullet holes and the shrapnel scars it had received.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This locomotive was designed in Philadelphia in 1920 and shipped to Florida, where it hauled freight along the coast for over 30 years. In 1951, the engine was purchased by the Georgia-based Gainesville-Midland line and given the number 301. The 301 served this role for eight years, before Gainesville-Midland was purchased by Seaboard Locomotive and the engine was donated to the city of Charlotte for display. 

Once gifted to Charlotte, the 301 was installed at Freedom Park, a beautiful 98-acre park in the heart of the Queen City. Since 1959, this display has served as a monument to the importance that engines of this type once played on rail lines across the country. It also serves as a unique piece of playground equipment, as kids and adults can access the engineer’s cabin for a glimpse into the past. 


The engine can be freely visited at the Freedom Park playground at no cost. Nearby parking is also at no cost.]]></summary>

The monument sits on a beautiful site in the mountains overlooking the Churfirsten mountain range in Switzerland. Bickel built it in a style inspired by Greek temples, with tall marble columns and mosaic murals. The murals on one wall depict a family—man, woman, and the creation of a new life. On the opposite wall, the murals depict the struggles of life and the path to a spiritual awakening.]]></summary>

As pilot Maxime Raynaud banks over the desolate coastline of Morocco’s far south, he can just make out a fishing port, a faded white fortress, and a ruined castle marooned in the sea.

The landing can be tricky, and Raynaud approaches fast to steady his Tecnam P2010 aircraft in the strong crosswinds, avoiding two radio antennae before touching down on a dirt airstrip peppered with small stones. At 2000 feet, the airstrip leaves little margin for error.

“We don’t carry much fuel, and we can’t refuel here,” says Raynaud. “If we made a second approach, we might have to divert.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Radiation is generally seen as a dangerous thing and exposure to it should be minimized. But this hasn't always been the case. In the past radium was seen as a healthy thing and was used in many products. Some of these products remain to this day, like the Japanese radium onsen, where bathing in radium water is believed to be healthy.

Radium onsen is one of the oldest bathhouses in Osaka, dating back to 1952. Apart from a traditional hot bath, they also have a carbonated bath, a cold bath, an electric bath where bathers are shocked with a low amp current.  The infamous radium bath is located outside. The radium ore in the bath is sourced from a now-closed mine in Ningyotoge. Fortunately, the dose is not strong. (Depending on how long you stay in the water, you might get more radiation exposure from flying.)

The water is said to cure all kinds of aches and diseases and is popular with older people for this reason. The onsen even suggests drinking it for added medicinal value, which is much more dangerous in terms of radiation exposure. Nevertheless, no death has been attributed to the onsen.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1688, the Glorious Revolution saw William III and his wife Mary ascend to the English throne, marking the end of Catholic rule under James II.

In tribute to William's reign, an impressive equestrian statue was erected in St James's Square, London. This magnificent sculpture, crafted from bronze, portrays William III as a powerful Roman general, evoking a sense of strength and authority. Despite being dressed in Classical garb, however, William's hairstyle remains true to the late 17th century.

Notably, another aspect of the statue that is true to life can be seen at its base. By the feet of William's horse is the distinctive mound of a molehill. This small inclusion is a reference to the incident in which William's horse stumbled over a molehill at Hampton Court Palace, causing William to fall and sustain injuries that ultimately led to the king's death.

This humble lump, the cause of the king's undignified demise, is said to have led his opposition, most notably the Jacobite supporters of James II, to raise a toast to the mole or as they eloquently phrased it, "to the little gentleman in a velvet jacket."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the middle of a residential neighborhood in Pune stands an ancient temple with a huge tree growing all around the structure. The tree has beautifully encapsulated the entire structure and is now a part of the temple.

This temple is called Zakoba Temple, with the name “Zakoba” referring to the temple’s deity. An equestrian idol of the deity is enshrined within the “Gabhara” (the sacred inner chamber of the temple). The entrance of the temple has two stone pillars. On either side of the entrance, there are two “Virgals” (Victory Stones/Hero Stones) depicting warriors. Within and around the temple there are idols and photos of other deities also.

The temple is painted in shades of yellow and red. The peepal tree (Ficus religiosa) surrounding the structure is most fascinating. The tree has made its way along the temple’s ancient stonework over the centuries and it now hugs the temple affectionately. It is beautiful to admire nature’s artwork in the way the tree’s branches and roots weave themselves through the stonework, creating a stunning display of the union of natural elements.

According to sources, some people believe this temple to be around 200-300 years old, considering its style of architecture and fascinating intricacies.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2003, visitors to the Nashville Farmers’ Market have been lining up for platters of curry goat, jerk chicken, and braised oxtail. Dishes at Jamaicaway come in generous portions with spice levels that range from “mild” to the habanero-heavy “FIYAH.” Everything from the ackee and saltfish—the national dish of Jamaica—to the curry chicken–stuffed roti is made from scratch. 

In many ways, the restaurant feels akin to Nashville’s iconic meat-and-threes—cafeteria-style dining establishments that have been central to the city’s dining scene since the 1920s—albeit one where Southern sides like mac ‘n’ cheese, collard greens, and cheesy mashed potatoes share plate-space with Caribbean favorites such as plantains, breadfruit, and bammy. The stellar dessert menu is equally culturally split, with slabs of Southern–style frosted layer cakes and Jamaican treats like coconut milk–soaked sweet potato pone.

Owners Ouida and Dave Bradshaw now have something of a small restaurant empire in Nashville. Jamaicaway, a play on both the couple's home country and a parkway in Boston, where they previously lived, now has three branches around town. “[Ouida] has a very gifted hand,” Dave says. “Food has always been in her DNA.”

By the age of 10, Ouida was already helping her mother in the kitchen. While working as an elementary school teacher in Boston, her homemade treats quickly developed a fanbase among her students. “She’d tell them if they did well on a test, she’d cook them a meal,” Dave says.

The couple's son, Kamal Kalokah, who decided to go to culinary school after working at the family business, went on to become Rihanna's personal chef and tour with Drake. He and his brother, Rashean Conaway, currently run Riddim n Spice, a popular Caribbean restaurant in North Nashville. 

Nowadays, you don’t have to ace a test in order to try Ouida’s cooking. Swing by Monday through Friday for a curried goat plate and a slice of the ultra-moist, boozy black cake as a sweet reward.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost 200 miles north of Sweden, in the small city of Hudiksvall, Glada Hudik-teatern, the Happy Hudik Theater, gives people with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to participate in professional theater productions. Numerous plays and musicals, some of them televised, have been staged to showcase the talents and skills of the performers.

Bosse Östlin, who was born with an intellectual impairment, joined the ensemble in 1996 and toured theatrical venues in Sweden and abroad for several years. He played the Tin Man in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Despite his character not having a heart, Östlin was well-known for his huge heart. The actor loved hugs and would ask anyone, anytime, and anywhere for an embrace. In fact, in 2013, he even starred in a Swedish drama-comedy movie How Many Hugs Are There In The World?.

In 2015, Östlin died at the age of 63 of a brain hemorrhage. The following year, at the initiative of Glada Hudik-teatern, a life-sized bronze statue honoring the late performer was erected in Hudiksvall, his hometown. Sculptor Hanna Beling created the bronze, which was financed through auctions and crowdfunding. The statue is one of the first in Sweden to depict a person with an intellectual disability.

To honor Östlin's love of hugs, the bronze is filled with heating coils and maintains a normal human body temperature all year round, encouraging passersby to stop and give the statue an embrace. Östlin often said, "If I get a hug, I'll be in a happy mood!" And today the warm likeness is a poignant memorial to the beloved actor's catchphrase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first glance, St. Martin's Theatre doesn't seem that special. From the outside, it's just another building in the West End of London with colorful neon lights starkly contrasting on an all-white Victorian facade. Walk 100 feet in any direction and you're sure to find more neon-lit, Victorian theaters. But what makes St. Martin's special isn't the building itself, but the production that takes place each night, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap.

For nearly 50 years, St. Martin's has continuously run the same play every day of the week besides Sundays. The theater has been so closely linked to the play that most of the decor in its foyer is centered around the show. There are plaques and awards hung on the walls for the show's record-breaking run. A giant wooden counter in the theater's entrance lets theater-goers know what performance number they are attending. Despite the fact that seeing show 29,160 will be the exact same as show 29,159, there is a sense of pride knowing that you played a small part in extending the streak.

The play itself is fantastic; there is a reason why it's still running to this day after debuting over 70 years ago in 1952 (and moving to St. Martin's in 1974). The "Queen of Crime," Agatha Christie, switches up her usual medium of novels to tell a captivating murder mystery tale for the stage all while retaining the same themes and motifs that make her books extraordinary. And since it is a murder mystery play with a few dramatic reveals, that is all I can give away! Do yourself a favor and book tickets to solve the murder and see the world's longest-running theater show!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[North of Devils Tower and west of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, travelers will find this most curious place of worship, which stands as a testament to the geological history of the surrounding region. Built in 1895, this unusual facade of this church is covered in scoria, a type of hardened lava found around the badlands.

Resourceful members of the congregation went 'rock picking' and scoured the surrounding area for chunks of volcanic stone. This true community effort has a place of honor on the National Register of Historic Places.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[St. Peter's Rock Grotto is a beautiful, idyllic spot located in the tiny village of Farmer, South Dakota (Population: 15). It was constructed between 1926 and 1933. The grotto was built by Fr. Peter N. Scheier using natural materials, often ones he purchased on trips to the Black Hills.  

The Grotto was once surrounded by a Roman Catholic elementary school, but that institution closed in 1959. The Grotto underwent a formal restoration in 2001, and at that time it was inducted into the National Register of Historic Places.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The old exchange building Bukit Nanas is located at the intersection of Jalan Gereja and Jalan Raja Chulan. The building was built in 1928 as the Central Battery Telephone Exchange by the British during their colonization of Malaysia. The site was ideally suited as it provided important links to Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding environment. It was subsequently upgraded from manual to mechanical in 1938.

During World War II, the building was targeted by the Japanese before their occupation of Malaysia. Afterward, the British return was short-lived and the building was taken over by Telekom Malaysia following independence.

With the inception of International Direct Dialing from Malaysia, the requirement for switchboard-operated communications ended including the use of the building. However, in 1985, the prime minister at the time saved the building from demolition.

The Telecommunication Museum was the first of its kind in Malaysia to have interactive exhibits. The museum is a repository of old telephones and outdated machinery once used for telecommunication. It houses several audio-visual exhibits, educative rooms for school kids archives, and resource areas with some artifacts over 120 years old and going back to the prewar era. Apart from an array of very stylish phones, there is even a telephone book that includes popular advertisements from the 1960s.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blink and you might miss the entrance to this 40-meter-long cave, where you can spot fossilized shells embedded in walls. About 3 million years ago, the cave and steep canyon walls were carved out by ocean waves, although the green lushness that awaits at the end of the tunnel these days feels more like a scene out of Jurassic Park than an underwater seascape.

The steep canyon walls create a valley full of hairpin turns that open up at the other end of the cave. They are completely covered with a thick layer of tropical ferns. The temperature here remains around 20 degrees Celsius all year, making it not only a cool escape from Kochi's balmy summers, but also the perfect spot for over 40 species of fern to thrive. The sheer quantity and diversity of the plant life were recognized as a National Natural Monument in 1915.

The 30-minute walk along the little river that runs along the bottom of the canyon and over the rustic little bridge,  with sunbeams breaking through to illuminate the bright green, curly ferns, along with the total quiet, make the Ioki Cave feel like a sacred space, and are reminiscent of scenes from Ghibli movies. There are three waterfalls, with the largest tucked away at the end of the trail, the water collecting in a green-blue pool basin.

Unlike many Japanese natural beauty spots, which are often depressingly paved with concrete to make walking paths, the adjustments here are minimal. Be sure to bring sturdy shoes (or borrow some rain boots from the nearby visitor's center) to protect your feet from the damp and the occasional snake.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The approach to the Golden Gate is one of the most hazardous sea routes in the world. It is narrow with swift currents, is flanked by numerous partly submerged rocks, and is often the site of dense fog. It furthermore is heavily trafficked. Even with today's navigational aids such as radio, GPS, and radar it can be perilous.

In the days of sail and steam it was much more so, as shown by the occurrence of many shipwrecks. These dangers motivated the construction of this lighthouse on the north side of the passage in 1855. The original location proved to be too high, such that the light was often obscured by fog, and so the lighthouse was moved to its present site in 1877. The light was first fueled by whale oil, then by kerosene, and then by oil vapor. Since 1927, the light has been an electric incandescent lamp. Though all these changes, the original Fresnel lens, made in the 1850s, has remained in use.

The lighthouse also included a foghorn and a building housing a steam boiler, built in 1903, still exists below the lighthouse proper, although it is usually closed to the public. The foghorn was basically a steam whistle like those on locomotives. A foghorn still exists, but it is now electric.

The light was finally automated in 1981, the last on the United States west coast, and the lighthouse keeper's cottage was torn down.

Although the light still actively operates under the management of the US Coast Guard, the rest of the structure is accessible as a historic site managed by the National Park Service, with scheduled open times when docents are available for talks and to take questions.]]></summary>

The mill processed corn and wheat for local farmers, and was one of the first in the area to process cottonseed, peanut, and castor bean oil. It was in operation until 1896 when the mill finally shut down operations due to the addition of larger, more efficient mills in the area. 

Today, the ruins of the mill are visible along the Briar Creek greenway on the edge of the Myers Park High School campus. The ruins can be freely explored and the site includes an informational sign about the mill’s history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dodie Smith, the author of the beloved children's book 101 Dalmatians, lived near the Suffolk town of Sudbury for more than 60 years. She frequented the town for shopping and banking, and was a recognizable presence in the community. It may come as no surprise then that Sudbury features in her classic book. One notable scene from the story features the town’s St Peter's Church. The church, or more specifically, the water fountain outside it, serves as the spot where Pongo and Missis rested while searching for their lost puppies.

"They had hoped they might meet some dog and hear if any news of the puppies had come at the Twilight Barking, but not so much as a cat was stirring. While they were drinking at the fountain, church clocks began to strike midnight.”

Today, visitors can still see this fountain where the two dogs took their break, though water no longer flows. Additionally, for those with a keen eye, a red bollard adorned with the bronze likeness of Pongo can be spotted across the street. This bollard is just one of the 14 in Sudbury's Talbot Trail, each bollard depicting a unique character or event from the town's rich history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On visiting Bristol Well, visitors will be struck by what looks like terraces of obsidian near some of the ruins. The terraces are indeed made of black glass and look similar to obsidian, but they are decidedly not of natural origin. They are slag, the waste product from smelting metal from ore.

A smelter was built at Bristol Well in the 1870s to process silver-lead ores from the Bristol Mine in the eponymous mountains about four miles east. The availability of water for processing, indicated by the "Well" in the name, was evidently a factor in this location.  A mill was built in 1880, and a new copper smelter was constructed around 1890, when the population may have been around 400. It didn't last however, the smelter was inactive by 1893, after which only small-scale activity took place. Bristol Well has been deserted since the early 20th century.

Besides the slag terraces, a couple of partly unroofed stone buildings remain as well as the mill foundation. Of particular interest are three beehive kilns at the south edge of the site. These are ovens for making the charcoal used in the smelting. Their workmanship is not as good as many other preserved 19th-century kilns, and a couple have partly collapsed.]]></summary>

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”]]></title>

        <title type="html"><![CDATA[Throw back to one little AGI (daughter) feeding other little AGIs — somewhere in an ashram in haridwar a few months ago. She has no priors about acts of service and what it means, but felt incredibly excited to keep at it. Why? 

What is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? 

One is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. 

Similarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.]]></title>
