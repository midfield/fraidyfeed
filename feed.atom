        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Americans have become less committed to organized religion in the past few decades.  But does that mean that we are becoming more secular or that religion is becoming more individualized--ie, religious feelings are less connected to organized religion?  In 1962, the Gallup Poll asked "Would you say that you have ever had a religious or mystical experience--that is, a moment of sudden religious insight or awakening?"  20% said yes, 73% no, and 7% were listed as "no code or no data."  If the last group was "don't know" I'd count it as "no," but since that's not clear I'll treat it as missing.  Gallup asked the question again in 1976, and other organizations asked in 1994, 2006, and 2009.  The results:

1962     22%    78%
1976     31%    69%
1994     34%    66%
2006     48%    52%

“It has to be at least six layers,” insists Charlotte McGehee, co-owner of Bakery Bar and Debbie on the Levee, two bakeries in New Orleans, Louisiana, that specialize in the locally famous doberge (DOH-bash) cake.

“In my opinion, fewer than six is just a regular ol’ layer cake,” she says. “You miss out on that feeling of your fork working through each alternating texture, and the nervousness you get because you don’t want that beautiful tower of cake to topple before you make it to the bottom.”

The dessert’s decadent journey begins with a thin layer of yellow butter cake as the base, topped with an equally thin layer of custard—traditionally chocolate, lemon, or caram…]]></summary>

One of the most popular destinations in Vietnam today, it is home to the Imperial City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1993, as well as the Thiên Mụ temple complex and numerous mausoleums of Nguyễn emperors.

Almost across the Perfume River from the Thiên Mụ temple, however, there is also an unusual historic site overlooked by most visitors. Walk along the narrow residential alleys of the Trường Đá village and it will soon reveal itself all of a sudden, at the end of the street: the Tiger Arena, a huge enclosure surrounded by 16-foot-tall walls.

While it may look like an ancient Roman arena, the site once held mortal combats even more intriguing and perhaps cruel than gladiatorial games. Hổ Qu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A certain point in the Rhine marks the point where three countries meet. While it is hard to get there without a boat, the nearby marker makes up for it. 

The tri-border point, or Dreiländereck as it is called in German, marks the point where Germany, France, and Switzerland intersect. The marker itself is built to resemble a futuristic rocket, with one of the three country flags on each of the wings. It is located on a piece of Swiss land approximately 150 meters (495 feet) southeast of the actual point where the three borders intersect.

What makes this tri-border point rare compared to most is that there are no passports or visas needed to cross it, or any other border in that location, given that all three countries have a free travel agreement.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every Christmas season, the owner of this house, a harpist for the Pacific Northwest Ballet Orchestra in Seattle, hauls these figures over from a storage facility and carefully installs them in the yard. After a few days, they are ready to entertain local neighbors, offering them the most enchanting, cheerful, and, of course, wild, holiday experience ever created in a garden lawn.

These figures were originally designed by none other than Maurice Sendak, the author who is known for his whimsical children's books, such as Where the Wild Things Are. They were used as lobby displays for the Pacific Northwest Ballet's production of The Nutcracker, which was performed from 1983 to 2014, and of which the sets and costumes were designed by Sendak himself. Since 2015, PNB has done George Balanchine's version, with art by another children's author, Ian Falconer.

Besides the iconic Sendak sculptures, this display is sure to please you during the holidays. From the enormous 15-foot Nutcracker to the lovely ornaments on the tree, this is a unique holiday experience unlike any other in the Seattle suburbs. If you look closely at the house's roof, you can even see a cutout of the Wild Thing from Sendak's iconic book. And, of course, the house even features the original stage props that were used onstage prior to their retirement.

Even though this Nutcracker production no longer performs, its spirit lives on in this magical holiday wild rumpus, preserving a large part of Seattle's own holiday history.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Hitler had elaborate military bunker complexes built throughout Masuria (then part of Germany, now part of Poland) in order to keep a closer eye on the war effort. While Hitler and his inner circle based themselves at the infamous Wolf's Lair, the Nazis' Supreme Military Command was located at a separate site called "Mauerwald" (now Mamerki) just 20 kilometers to the northeast.

The full Mauerwald military complex consisted of nearly 250 separate buildings and bunkers constructed in the forest just west of Mauer Lake (now Mamry Lake), the majority of which remain abandoned and freely accessible in the woods. The heart of the compound, however, is now confined within the Mamerki Bunker Museum, which seeks to preserve the core bunker structures. The museum is complete with underground tunnels and exhibitions on the Nazi war effort, including full-size recreations of daily life in the bunkers and other scenes.

Adding to the location's lore, Mauerwald is also one of several locations theorized to be a possible hiding place of the Amber Room. Erich Koch, purportedly the last person to have known the room's fate, was brought to the site in the 1970s as part of the search, and ground-penetrating radar has also been used since 2016 to search for hidden chambers. Although the search has proved fruitless so far, the sheer size of the complex suggests that it may still have additional secrets to reveal.]]></summary>

Meanwhile, in Thailand, the kingdom of Ayutthaya was in desperate need of military reinforcements as the Toungoo dynasty of Burma continued its invasion. Sharing common interests, the king welcomed hundreds of masterless samurai to his army as mercenaries.

At the same time, unrelated to the Burmese-Siamese Wars, many Japanese merchants came to Ayutthaya to export high-quality swords while importing Thai silver, ceramics, and leatherware. It was not long before a Japanese village was formed on the southeast side of the Chao Phraya river, opposite the Portuguese settlement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Silver was discovered in Ophir Canyon in the 1860s, but early mining efforts were defeated by the very hard rock which was unexpectedly expensive to drill and mill. After the discovery of a new orebody in the Murphy Mine, the only significant producer, a revival followed beginning in 1872 and lasting into the 1880s. However, activity had largely ceased by 1890 and the post office closed in 1893.

Ruins of the mill and a brick-and-stone building that was probably the store still can be seen, as well as several roofless stone cabins. The portal of the Murphy Mine itself remains open, although entering it is hazardous. Unfortunately, several years ago the Forest Service razed some of the remaining stone buildings as public hazards.

After the turn of the last century, there was only small-scale and intermittent activity on precious metal extraction. In the mid-20th century, however, tungsten deposits were discovered and worked near the canyon mouth. This lasted until the mid-1960s when the tungsten market collapsed due to the removal of the strategic-metal subsidies.

Little is left of the tungsten operations. A mill for tungsten to the south of the canyon mouth survived till the early 2010s but has since been torn down. A cemetery from the early days is preserved on the north side of the canyon mouth.]]></summary>

Buy a ticket to Grotto dello Smeraldo in Amalfi, then take a boat from the Amalfi Harbor and disembark at the grotto shore; a guide in a large rowboat will give you a tour of the cave, pointing out interesting rock formations and, at the end, a small nativity scene that has been placed beneath the water by divers.

The collection is called El refugio de la vida (the shelter of life).

Armiño has his work on display in other parts of Alcorcón but it is here in the park that his best pieces can be admired together with the nearby Castillos de Valderas. Armiño spent months working on these pieces which were eventually acquired by the Alcorcón city council and carefully placed in the Parque de los Castillos in 2005.

Carlos Armiño began his artistic career as a painter before shifting his focus to sculpture, a task to which he has devoted himself for years. He masters different shapes depending on the materials he works with. Considering that these 16 pieces would have to endure the harshness of both summers and winters in this part of Madrid, he decided to use concrete for the pieces on display at this park in Alcorcón but he has also worked with iron and wood, the latter being his great passion.]]></summary>

In Europe, that imbalance is 10 to one: For every 10 streets named after men, there’s only one named after a woman. The most popular person in European street names is a woman, though: the Virgin Mary, in a wide variety of appellations.

146,000 Streets in 17 Countries

So says Mapping Diversity, a project that analyzes representation in street names across Europe. Its researchers analyzed close to 146,000 streets in 30 major cities across 17 European countries. More than one-third (nearly 53,000) were named after people, with just under 48,000 named after men, and just under 4,800 after women—less than 10 percent of all streets named after people.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the buildings in Novi Beograd's Blok 28 were designed by architect Ilija Arnautović and constructed from 1970 to 1974. Among them are the two parallel apartment buildings known locally as the "TV set building" or "TV building," giving a loose translation. In you next venture to Belgrade's western neighborhood, you will not miss this gem when you are met with what looks like a gigantic beige wall with a sea of little TVs plastered to it.

Hilariously, on the creation of the building, Yugoslav president Tito expressed the following to Arnautovic: "I'm glad that you have decided not to build residential buildings higher than ten floors. This is good, because it is not easy for those who have to walk when the elevator breaks down. I am now also looking at those solitaires that have been built. There are very beautiful ones - most of them. There are also a few that, let me tell you, I don't like at all. For example, the ones with windows that look like a television." 

Today, the building is an object of debate amongst Belgraders. Some like it, some don't - the latter due to the fact that it looks especially cramped and uncomfortable to live in. Either way, Arnautovic's Blok 28 is home to a lot of unique buildings, with this one considered one of Novi Beograd's major symbols.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To mark Pride Month 2023, we hunted through the Atlas Obscura archives for stories that have long been overlooked in mainstream American history: tales of people across the centuries—from as long ago as Colonial Williamsburg—who would now be thought of as part of the LGBTQIA+ community. "Desire is nothing new,” says Michael Bronski, a historian at Harvard University and author of A Queer History of the United States. “There’s no reason to think that everything that happens now in terms of desire and sexual activity didn’t happen back then.” The challenge for historians is finding these long-lost stories—from times when society demanded they be hidden.

They had also gathered to eat. On the eve of November 20, a petite soufflé of lobster, suprême of chicken Périgourdine, and an endive salad with mousse de fromage and avocado preceded pear sorbet, petit fours, and coffee. Waiters walked the Summit dining room pouring a 1983 Silverado Chardonnay, a Stag’s Leap Cabernet Sauvignon of 1974, and, notably, a 1982 Iron Horse Blanc de Blanc to pair with each course.

Stumbled upon in an attempt to mine lead, the cave was instead mined for calcite. (Model T Ford gear shifts were made of calcite from Cosmic Cavern.)

The cave contains many unique features, including the longest known soda straw in the Ozark Mountains, at nin feet long. One of the two bottomless lakes is the largest cave lake in the Ozarks. A cave diver attempted to find the bottom by throwing his air tank down a crevasse and shimmying further. While he survived the attempt, he did not manage to find the bottom, and no more cave dives were permitted.

But what makes the cave so unique is the secret area discovered in 1993 via dynamite. A hole in the cave suggested another room behind the end. This hypothesis was correct; the new chamber held untouched features and an additional bottomless lake. This makes a great comparison between what man's effect on the cave ecosystem looks like. The first part of the cave is covered in soot, invasive algae, and broken formations.  The new chamber is pristine, with some features completely transparent.]]></summary>

, a collaboration between folks at Ohio University and Argonne, is a neat combination of  and (-enabled) resonant x-ray absorption.  The authors bring an STM tip (an extremely sharp metal tip) down to within a nm of the sample surface, so that electrons can tunnel quantum mechanically from the sample to the tip.  Then bang the sample with x-rays that are resonant with core levels of particular atoms in the sample.  In this case, one sample consisted of iron-containing molecules.  The x-rays could kick electrons out of the iron atoms where they are then detected by the tip, allowing atomic-resolution mapping of the desired atoms.  (It's a bit more subtle than that - see Fig. 2j - but that's basically the gist.…]]></summary>

Recently celebrating its 25th anniversary, the garden was championed by the Friends of Mallory Square, and opened in September 1997 to celebrate the men and women who have had the greatest impact on Key West.

There are some familiar faces and names immortalized here like fisher/drinker/author Ernest Hemingway, former President Harry S. Trueman, and railway magnate Henry M. Flagler, but a glance at the others reveals the deep and often-unknown history of the island, which h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Behind Fergusson College in Pune, there is a beautiful hill with lots of walking trails. The hill is called Fergusson Hill or Hanuman Tekdi, because there is a temple of Lord Hanuman on the top. A short distance from it, along the walking trail is an old stone monument that towers over the lush green landscape. The monument commemorates the establishment of The Servants of India Society on 12 June 1905 by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent leader, and social reformer.

Along with him were eminent citizens like Natesh Appaji Dravid, Gopal Krishna Deodhar, Surendra Nath Banerjee, Anant Patwardhan, and others. The purpose of starting this organization was to bring about social reforms in the country, thereby uplifting the people. The primary goal was the promotion of social and human development.

 The society was founded on the belief that for the development of the country, there should be a group of dedicated, selfless, and intelligent people who will dedicate their lives to the service of the nation. The society organized events and campaigns that focused on eradicating social evils like discrimination, oppression, poverty, domestic abuse, etc. There was an emphasis on nation-building activities such as education, sanitation, health care, upliftment of the underprivileged sections, etc. The society worked to unite people of different ethnicities and religions for welfare purposes.

In recent times, on the occasion of the centenary ceremony in 2005, the monument was renovated and a tree plantation drive was carried out. The monument stands as a proud reminder of the efforts taken by the citizens toward the betterment of society.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the small town of Cheverie, Nova Scotia, you will find an odd-looking brick structure near a salt marsh trail. This is the Camera Obscura which was built in 2012 by architecture students from Dalhousie Univerity.

The style of the structure is a construction technique called Guastavino, which is named after a Spanish architect from the late 19th century. And keeping consistent with that period, the camera uses the same "old" technology and works as it would have during that time.

The design of the exterior has three overlapping arches. Walking through the darker interior, you will see closed doors. This area is officially the large-scale pinhole camera, that you enter and close the doors behind you for the full effect. When you look up, there is a reflected and upside-down view of the cliffs across the water, and on the concrete floor below you is a real-time projection. 

The small community you drive through to get to the camera obscura is quite beautiful to pass and the structure itself is quite amazing to see.]]></summary>

Motifs in Mongolian rock art include human figures that appear to morph into large winged birds, enclosures filled with dots, and horses traveling along trails. The rock art was first recorded by the Soviet scientist A.P. Okladnikov in 1960. In addition to the Bronze Age art, there are ink paintings that date back to the 13th century featuring inscriptions in Mongolian, Chinese, and Tibetan.

The other attraction here is the many ovoo, structures adorned with ceremonial silk scarves, or khadag. The ovoo are littered with offerings and represent a resurgence of traditional Mongolian shamanism.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Even in the ritzy Ginza district of Tokyo, quaint Shinto shrines aren’t uncommon; most of them, however, are placed on the rooftops of tall department store buildings and can hardly be viewed from street level. Hōdō Inari Shrine is a rare exception, but it’s almost as hard to find—perhaps even harder.

Originally founded at some point during the Edo period (1603-1867), the shrine was dedicated to Inari, the all-rounder fox god, and meant to be a place to pray for children’s health. It is said that it was built for the shogun after several of his children had died young, and that it was relocated to Ginza from the premises of Edo Castle (today’s Imperial Palace). The kanji for Hōdō stands for “treasure” and “child.”

As a rhino keeper at Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park near Orlando, Florida, it’s up to her to keep them physically fit, psychologically healthy, and otherwise entertained.

“There's a lot of job security with white rhinos,” says Westgard, who has worked with them at Disney for 10 years. “They require a lot of care.”

It’s also a weighty job. There are only 27,000 rhinos left on Earth, and three of the five species are considered critically endangered. With nearly 10,000 poached in the last decade—including one at a zoo in France—the thousand or so animals in managed care worldwide are considered crucial to the long-term survival of all rhin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The one time Patricia Arquette actually tried to work for a private investigator, as a side hustle early in her acting career, her wire came loose and fell out. Years later, the Academy Award–winning actress is getting a second chance at the gig in High Desert, a comedy series that debuted May 17, 2023, on Apple TV+. In High Desert, Arquette plays Peggy Newman, a former drug dealer–turned–Pioneertown Old West reenactor. Faced with foreclosure on her late mother’s home, Peggy starts moonlighting as a gumshoe, scaling the titular region of Southern California in search of curious clues to peculiar cases—all while fighting her own battle with addiction and mourning the loss of her mother. It’s funny, poignant, and, like the High Desert itself, just the right amount of weird.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your first clue that Redheaded Stranger is no ordinary taco joint is perched on a corner barstool. He’s a giant stuffed giraffe with braided pigtails and a T-shirt that reads “NO FUCKIN’ CHIPS,” and his name is Willie—in honor of Mr. Nelson, of course.

Your second clue is that for years, the not-so-secret order here was the Crunchwrap. “My mom's favorite restaurant is Taco Bell, so I grew up eating a lot of [Crunchwrap Supremes],” says chef Bryan Lee Weaver. The restaurant initially kept it off the official menu out of low-key fear of litigation.

“We ran it as a special and it sold like crazy, so we just kind of kept doing it.” Unlike the fast-food iteration, Redheaded Stranger’s versions include fillings like house-made green chile pork and whipped feta.

Sometime between then and today, the city’s Broadway took a turn for the wild. Nowadays, most locals give the neon-drenched street a wide berth and complain that the area has become something of a parody of itself—a relentless bachelorette party and booze-fueled musical carnival, all rolled into one strip. 

Come nightfall, “Nashvegas” fills with roving packs of women donning sashes, cowgirl boots, and hats. Many of the bar-venues boast a loose celebrity tie-in, from Justin Timberlake’s Twelve Thirty Club to Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville to Kid Rock’s thunderous, multistory Big A** Honky Tonk Rock N’ Roll Steakhouse.

Opened in the fall of 1994, this oddity in Ottawa's Wellington West shopping district has been helping adventurers not die while doing awesome (dangerous, fantastic) things for almost 30 years. Long enough, in fact, to be one of the first small businesses in Ottawa to have an online presence.

World of Maps supplies travelers and curious minds with early cartographic facsimiles, maps of the Milky Way galaxy, and even a flat-earth map for those always questioning reality. A sliding wall showcases the most popular maps for easy perusing.

Maps aren't the only treasures to find inside. Shelves are teeming with books on niche topics like ink-making, foraging, and how to read the night sky, while funky globes spin and illuminate the shop beside old-style navigational tools like compasses, sextants, and "the eye of time." Even professionals can find something inside, with air and nautical charts, logbooks, and topographic maps.

Really just a great place to get lost in.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep in the far east of Catholic Poland are two historically Muslim villages with histories dating back to the Middle Ages. Kruszyniany and its smaller sister village, Bohoniki, are the last Polish villages still inhabited by the Lipka Tatars, a Muslim Turkic people who originally came to Europe in the 1200s. The Tatars joined the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in every major military campaign of the time, notably the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, and as a reward for their loyalty, the Tatars were granted the right to settle in eastern Poland.

Over the centuries, the Tatars adopted the Polish language and integrated into Polish society while maintaining their distinct religious and cultural identity. Despite their religious differences with the Polish state, they were considered full citizens who had earned their place in Polish society on the battlefield. After World War II, however, the resulting border shifts in Eastern Europe resulted in these Tatar communities being splintered between Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus, with only the villages of Kruszyniany and Bohoniki remaining within Polish borders.

Today, Kruszyniany is the center of Poland's original Tatar community, and its modest yet impressive Green Mosque attracts visitors from all over the country who are interested in learning more about Poland's Muslim minority. The mosque is maintained by descendants of the original Lipka Tatars who are enthusiastic about sharing their unique history and culture with their fellow Poles and with the rest of the world. Across the street is also a restaurant (Tatarska Jurta) serving traditional Tatar cuisine with English- and Polish-language descriptions of Tatar dishes.

Kruszyniany's smaller sister village of Bohoniki, about 30km to the north, also boasts a traditional wooden mosque maintained by Tatar-descended locals who are happy to explain their history and religious customs to curious visitors.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most denizens of the summer night sky are easy to find: There’s the bright stars Vega and Arcturus, the constellation Cygnus the Swan, the Big Dipper. But one of my favorites is a little harder to see, and worth the effort and the small amount of equipment you’ll need to do it. The Beehive Cluster, also known as M44, is as much a harbinger of summer as the sound of wind chimes and katydid calls.

This week, the Beehive is joined by the planet Venus, shining bright in the western sky after sunset. The pairing is a great introduction to celestial companions you might not otherwise see—and to some equipment you might want for the rest of your summer stargazing.

The Beehive Cluster is found in the constellation Cancer the Crab, in its “chest,” according to Ptolemy. It is also known as Praes…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Botanical Gardens of Paris are full of meticulously sculpted but ominous statues, such as that of the lion devouring a child. Created by the same sculptor or animalier, Emmanuel Frémiet, Dénicheur d’Oursons is another, and perhaps even more brutal example of this trend.

At first glance, it seems like a heroic statue of a mostly-naked huntsman wrestling with a ferocious bear in an almost Herculean manner, but if you look closer at it, you’ll notice a grotesque trophy hanging from the hunter’s belt: a dead cub. Once it’s been noticed, the implication is clear. The human invader murdered the mother bear’s little baby, and she is attacking the man in fury.

The huntsman has stabbed the bear in the neck, but it does not seem to stop the maddened animal. The strength put into its bearhug is deadly—and the "cub snatcher" hangs loose in its arms, facing the same fate he forced the poor child into. It's all very realistic despite its dramatic nature, from the man's musculature to the bear's furious fur.]]></summary>

Christianity appropriated the symbol around 324, when the first known labyrinth appeared in a cathedral in Algeria. The intricate designs, which vary from church to church, are thought to represent an internal pilgrimage.

The Womanspace labyrinth and gardens are free and open to the public daily during daylight hours. The 11-circuit design is modeled after the Chartres Cathedral labyrinth in France. Its many turns reflect the journey of life, with its change and transition, rites of passage, and cycles of nature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An avid baker and native of Grand Isle, Vermont, Donna Sue Shaw started to offer homemade treats to the public from a shed in her front yard during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was Shaw's hope that passersby would use the shed as a place to stop and refuel as they traveled along the bike trail that traverses the island. Although she initially envisioned the bakery as a diversion, her pies were so good that it quickly became a destination in and of itself. 

Shaw sources most of her ingredients locally and sells her wares on an honor system. There is no cash register, rather a paper log, Venmo QR codes, and a bird house where you can leave cash to pay for whatever you take. Along with sweet and savory pies, she sells granola, local maple syrup, cookies, scones and cakes, all made from scratch in her home kitchen.]]></summary>

Measuring around 12 feet long, five feet wide, and five feet deep, the Doctor’s Bath could accommodate several patients at any one time. It features a number of channels that allow the basin to fill up with seawater when the tide reached a certain level, before the water actually got as high as the bath itself. 

Thalassotherapy, or seawater therapy, became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Swimming or wading in the ocean, seawater pools, and heated saltwater baths were common.]]></summary>

In the early 20th century, the elites of São Paulo wanted a venue to welcome the greatest performers of the day, from opera sopranos to ballet dancers. The Theater was, and still is, one of the main architectural and cultural landmarks in the city.

Construction on the building began in 1903 and its design was largely inspired by the Opera Garnier in Paris. Architect Ramos de Azevedo designed the massive theater with the help of Italian architects Cláudio Rossi and Domiziano Rossi. The theater eventually opened eight years later in 1911, and today is located in the city center, next to the Anhangabaú Valley.

Later, the Carthaginians made the island their base of operations for the conquest of ancient Hispania. Both the Phoenicians and Carthaginians buried their dead in places not far from their settlements. So while the walled city of the living grew,  today known as Dalt Vila, some 550 yards away on the nearby hill of Puig des Molins, the city's necropolis also grew. The name Puig des Molins can be loosely translated to "Windmill Hill," so called because windmills covered the hill as far back as the 15th century.

Today, the Puig de Molins Necropolis archaeological complex is adjacent to an accompanying museum highlighting the site's history. The necropolis is one of the largest in the Mediterranean. Estim…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Clifton Suspension Bridge is one of Bristol's most recognizable landmarks, but not many of the people who walk across it don't know about the 12 vaulted chambers hidden below the Leigh Woods Tower.

In 1831, the young engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel was awarded the contract to build the Clifton Suspension Bridge, intended to be the highest and longest bridge in the world. Immediately, the project was plagued by problems and was eventually abandoned altogether in 1853. Brunel died in 1859, leaving the bridge only half completed. His plans and drawings of the Leigh Woods abutment were lost, and the 12 enormous vaulted chambers inside were forgotten. 

The bridge was later completed in 1864, but it wasn't until the early 21st century that the chambers were rediscovered. A builder carrying out some repairs on the bridge found the mysterious vaults in 2002.

Today, the vaults are now open to visitors between April and October each year. Two of the biggest chambers can be explored as part of a guided visit, where it is possible to see stalactites almost 23 feet long and squeeze through a small passageway into an enormous cathedral-style hall with amazing echoing acoustics.]]></summary>

The careful construction of a mporo, a traditional beaded necklace of Kenya’s Samburu people, has begun. It’ll take her all day to complete just this one, but its jewel-like beads tell stories descended from time immemorial: those passed from mother to daughter. She has to take her time.

Thanks David!

About the Schubert calculus:  you won't be surprised that this is how I came to think about this.

And about the new notation:  I'm sold, and I've made the change.  (In the process, I noticed a number of small mistakes.)    I had earlier learned from you the importance of wisely choosing names and notation, and this very much applies here.]]></summary>

You are right!  The source of my cognitive error is that I wrote those complexes with subscripts rather than superscripts (for which the convention is that the d's would be *decreasing*, but I didn't say that).  I've now fixed it, by (i) making the subscripts superscripts as they should have been, and then (ii) having w degree-decreasing as you said.  Thanks!]]></summary>

The seating area was carved on-site in 1810 by convicted laborers. It was created for Elizabeth Henrietta Macquarie, the wife of Major-General Lachlan Macquarie, who served as Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821.

Perched at the end of the peninsula that became known as Mrs. Macquarie's Point, it was a frequent resting spot for the Governor's wife.

The pliability of churned, frozen cream makes it a great raw material to build upon—whether it’s covered in torched meringue to form a spiky, flaming mountain in Baked Alaska or shaped into a bombe floating in a sea of blackberry sauce to evoke a luminous, floating moon in Clair de Lune.

And all these without making any draft or using any scientific instruments. He created them only by using the divine gifts with which he was born; observation, perception, and passion for creativity.

The result is excellent and all the miniatures function in a perfect way. All his memories and personal experiences were strongly impressed on his mind and prompted him - with the help of his skillful hands- to revive the tradition and his dreams. The visitor can admire all types of Greek ships and the most important buildings around Cyclades.]]></summary>

He steers toward the beach, aiming for a potato-shaped rock the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. He’s here to take its picture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This small but mighty waterfall is located in the rugged rainforest of the Catlins Conservation Park, deep in the south of New Zealand. It's off the beaten track adventure and a must-see in the region.

Although Koropuku Falls is marked on local maps, the unofficial Koropuku Falls Walk that brings you to the base is listed only on a select few. And it’s not only the fantastic view of the waterfall that makes this area worth visiting, it’s the walk itself. 

Many walking tracks in New Zealand are constructed and maintained by the Department of Conservation (DOC), and must meet a standard width for consistency. But here, you'll be walking single file as the winding path meanders intimately through the bush, bringing you up close and personal with the best of NZ native fauna and flora. 

Lush ferns, mosses, lichens and native birdlife are abundant, even the tracks footing is made from pungas (native tree ferns) or nearby rocks from the stream. This magical walk offers a chance to experience being part of the bush, without disrupting the surrounding area. 

The unique track was hand-made by two local men, Wayne and Peter, and is a labor of love spanning over 20 years. There is even a bench dedicated to their wives for the amount of time they've spent here. They still maintain the track to ensure safety and enjoyment. 

The Catlins region has a rich Māori history, with abundant fresh seafood and forest food sources being a draw card for the first Polynesians. The remnants of their habitation are still found in the place names. In te reo Māori, Koropuku means lump or swelling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the Victorian era, a stint inside Ruthin Gaol was a fate close to death. Today, a visit serves as the perfect afternoon for fans of the macabre.

Ruthin Gaol was built in the late 18th century to replace a smaller "correction center" that was forced to modernize because conditions were so poor. It was expanded over the years and continued to function as a prison until 1916. After, the site became a makeshift munitions factory during World War II before eventually being partially converted into a public library and office space. Today, a large chunk of the building serves as the only purpose-built Pentonville-style prison (a prison that focused on isolating inmates in individual cells) open to the public as a heritage attraction.

Visitors are free to explore the cramped cells, where inmates spent the vast majority of their days alone, and witness the various forms of punishments dolled out for bad behavior. These ranged from a stint in the dark cell to a machine with a crank-shaft handle that prisoners were forced to turn thousands of times, despite it not actually serving any purpose.

Visitors will also learn stories about some of those who once inhabited these walls.]]></summary>

"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”]]></title>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Garza (Crane) surname is one of the most representatives of the Northern Mexican city of Monterrey and its metropolitan area, the country's second most-populated. This can be seen in the municipalities of San Nicolás de los Garza and San Pedro Garza García.

Many families originating in Monterrey, therefore, share the Garza name, and it was one of these that established Xicotepec's first permanent cinema, the Cine Garza. Monterrey is the capital of the state of Nuevo León, so the seal of this state was prominently added to the facade of the theater. The cinema started its operations in the 1950s, while three decades later, in 1986, a restaurant called La Choza (The Hut) also opened in the town.

In the mid-2000s, after the Cine Garza lay abandoned for a few years, La Choza occupied the building, where it is still located as of early 2023. The cinema's lobby is now the restaurant's waiting area, all seating was removed to make way for the tables and chairs, leaving the stage where the screen was located as the main architectural heritage is still present in the restaurant.

The stage is still used for the occasional show as well as events such as book presentations. For the most part, however, it is merely a decorated feature that diners can enjoy while tasting some of the local Xicotepense delicacies served here.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hidden away in one of Adelaide’s side streets lies the Royal Instituttion, formerly the Adelaide Stock Exchange. Within its walls is something that is often walked passed, missed, or forgotten about. Upon arrival at the Royal Institute, enter through the front entryway, turn to your left, and walk towards the main staircase. Atop the staircase is the oldest and perhaps the most valuable Morris & Co. stained glass work in Adelaide, also the only Morris & Co. stained glass window not within a religious building in Adelaide, which is often referred to as the “City of Churches.”

William Morris famously known for his London-based textile company, Morris & Co., was commissioned for several stained glass windows for the city of Adelaide. Almost all of them were located within churches and commissioned for religious reasoning. His work within the Royal Institute remains as one of his most valuable works to date, somehow surviving two fires during the 20th century, in 1938 and 1982 respectively, the stained glass window still stands in the main stairwell where it was originally commissioned.

The window was commissioned by Sir George. A. Brookman, an early mining mogul of South Australia and Western Australia, to commemorate the Australian Federation, an important moment in Australian history, in which the Australian colonies were joined together as a nation in 1901.

The window features six stained glass panels, with the lower three depicting the British Empire. Life-sized figures represent Australia and India on the left-hand side, Africa and Canada on the right, and Britannia in the center. Based on designs by British painter, Edward Byrne-Jones, a painter, designer and a founding partner of Morris & Co., the three upper panels represent morning, noon and evening. Upon closer inspection you’ll notice the central figure of Britannia is holding a wreath that frames the word ‘FEDERATION’, a nod to when the window was made.]]></summary>

Beyond the metropolis, the Sierra Madre Mountain range surrounds the city, including the famous El Cerro de la Silla, a hill shaped like a horse saddle. 

Mother nature's creations and man-made inventions influence the city below. However, there is one imposing figure whose inception is a little more unclear, perhaps the most revered of them all, and the mother of all Mexico's mothers: a 40-foot-tall sculpture of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

At her feet lie flowers and other tributes by those who have come to pay their respects. Onlooking drivers see her as they pass by on the busy main avenue where she stands. Immediately behind her, in line with the traffic, t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Poem Tree stood, for close to 450 years, on Castle Hill, at Oxfordshire’s Wittenham Clumps. In the 1840s, the tree was furnished with a carving by Joseph Tubb who etched the words of his 20-line poem into the beech.

As up the hill with labr'ing steps we tread / Where the twin Clumps their sheltering branches spread / The summit gain'd at ease reclining lay / And all around the wide spread scene survey / Point out each object and instructive tell / The various changes that the land befell / Where the low bank the country wide surrounds / That ancient earthwork form'd old Mercia's bounds / In misty distance see the barrow heave / There lies forgotten lonely Cwichelm's grave.

Around this hill the ruthless Danes intrenched / And these fair plains with gory slaughter drench'd / While at our feet where stands that stately tower / In days gone by up rose the Roman power / And yonder, there where Thames smooth waters glide / In later days appeared monastic pride. / Within that field where lies the grazing herd / Huge walls were found, some coffins disinter'd / Such is the course of time, the wreck which fate / And awful doom award the earthly great.

Inspired by his admiration for the surrounding landscape and its history, the careful process of carving this poem, from memory no less, is said to have taken Tubbs two weeks over the summer.

Though already 300 years old at the time of Tubb’s carving, the tree’s continued growth and development caused the poem to slowly become distorted as the years passed. With the foresight to know this unique poem had little time of legibility left, Henry Osmaston, a geographer in the area, took a rubbing in 1965 for posterity.

This rubbing was later recreated, alongside a transcription of the poem, on a stone close to the tree. Though placed in 1994 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the carving, the stone now stands as a memorial to the lost tree and poem, since the beech collapsed in 2012.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Small Shinto shrines aren’t a rare sight in the streets of Japan, typically consisting of a torii arch, an offertory box, and nothing much more. At first glance, Takao Inari Shrine in the Nihonbashi-Hakozakicho district of Tokyo seems like one of such shrines, with no attending priests, no amulets nor fortune slips to be seen, which are otherwise common in places of Shinto worship.

Nearly blending into the wall of an office building, the inconspicuous shrine recently underwent refurbishment work and boasts an ultra-modern, almost LEGO-like torii arch made out of a steel frame, as well as a painting of colorful clouds on the ceiling. The small sanctuary in the center is guarded by statuettes of kitsune, foxes serving the god of prosperity, Inari.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[San Pedro de Rocas is a fascinating and historic monastery in Galicia, Spain with a rich history that spans more than a millennium. The structure is a stunning example of ancient monastic architecture and dates back to the 6th century. Situated in a remote forested valley near the town of Esgos, the monastery's founding is shrouded in mystery. According to an inscription on a stone recording the monastery's founding, a group of religious men founded the monastery in 573. The monastery has also been linked to a Spanish knight named Gemodus, who, in the 9th century, is said to have revived the religious center. 

Since the 6th century, the monastery has undergone many changes and additions, becoming a vital center of religious and cultural life in the region for many centuries. The monastery is famous for its rock-cut architecture and intricate carvings, which are considered some of the finest examples of Romanesque art in Galicia.

One of the most intriguing features of San Pedro de Rocas is the tiny, rock-cut burial niches carved into the walls.  Another highlight is a faded fresco of a world map featuring the apostles. Located in the church, the map depicts the known world in the late 13th century. The fresco has been dated between 1175 and 1200. A unique example of medieval art, the map is said to share similar cosmological views with the maps seen in contemporary medieval manuscripts. The fresco is a remarkable work of art and a testament to the importance of San Pedro de Rocas in medieval Europe.

Visitors can explore the site, which includes a church, cloister, and living quarters, as well as a nearby museum that showcases the history and culture of the region. San Pedro de Rocas is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in architecture, history, or religious art.]]></summary>

The Scientists Coaxing Back Nature with Sound

by Katherine Latham, BBC Future

Palmyra Atoll, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, is a quiet place—too quiet. Eight vital species of seabirds disappeared from the island when it was overrun by rats. Now scientists hope to lure the birds back with a continuous soundtrack of familiar bird songs, one of many such efforts to use sound to restore the natural world. "Healthy island ecosystems are deafening," Alex Wegmann, lead scientist for The Nature Conservancy, told BBC Future. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Northern Albanians once lived by their own tribal code according to the Kanun, a set of customary laws established by the Kanun of Leke Dukagjini, a 15th-century nobleman. Among its 1,262 articles, the Kanun permits blood feuds (gjakmarrja), in which a person is entitled to "an eye for an eye" in the form of murder as retribution for killing or dishonoring a family member in the name of justice. It was not uncommon for these feuds to last years, spanning several generations and resulting in the deaths of multiple men—and sometimes even women and children as collateral damage—on both sides.

Beyond the Middle Ages, Kanun law persisted in parts of Albania, despite being outlawed by communist dictator Enver Hoxha. To this day, scattered blood feuds reportedly still exist, with some individuals isolating themselves at home in their villages, living in constant fear of eventual retaliation by a family scorned long ago by one of their ancestors. 

During feuds, male family members would confine themselves in towers called kullas to give themselves a defensive advantage over the opposing clan. The men would remain here until the ensuing feud was over, that is, until all males who posed a direct threat were killed, or until reconciliation was achieved, possibly with the help of a council of elders.

The kulla is located just off the main road in Theth, beyond the lineup of guesthouses. There are no designated opening hours, but locals in one of the neighboring houses will open the tower on request. At the time of writing, the admission fee is 200 leke.]]></summary>

Fakes are quite prevalent in those places, poorly made and artificially aged, and not only that, far more expensive than they should be. When it comes to ancient ceramics in Hội An, Vietnam, however, you may rest assured that you're in good hands. Not only are they genuine pieces of 15th-century China, but they also come with an intriguing provenance.

Located a little off the bustling streets of Hoi An Ancient Town, Nam Trân is a small family-run shop that offers a wide array of antique ceramics, particularly those recovered from a local shipwreck, which still lies about 25 miles off the coast.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Revered poet Antonio Machado was a member of a group of Spanish writers conventionally known as Generation of ‘98, influenced by the grim social and cultural ramifications of the historical crisis caused by the Spanish defeat in the Spanish-American War of 1898, which changed the shape of the world at large, including the United States of America as we know them.

Between 1919 and 1932, a few years before the eruption of the Spanish Civil War, Machado spent time in Segovia as a French teacher while he wrote controversial letters to a mystery lady, or maybe not such a mystery! Most claim that it was always postmodernist poet and playwright Pilar de Valderrama, whom he addressed as “Guiomar.”

Today, Segovia’s visitors can explore the curiosities that still inhabit the hostel/apartment Machado rented during those late years. The home is also quintessential of the Castilian lifestyle in provincial towns at the time. It's a multi-sensory experience that combines the traditional smell of old local wood exposed to the seasonal rigors, vintage books (including all Antonio Machado’s works in their original Spanish versions as well as translations into other languages), and reminiscent fabrics, all of it inundated with sunlight coming from every corner of the extremely narrow space.]]></summary>

Enter Turquet’s octopus (Pareledone turqueti), a cephalopod with a four-million-year pedigree that makes its home in the icy waters around Antarctica. Recent DNA analysis shows that two distinct populations of this species, one in the Weddell Sea and the other in the Ross Sea, mated about 125,000 years ago.

This could only have happened if the massive ice sheet that now separates those populations wasn’t there at the time. So yes, it did collapse. And that’s bad news, because it increases the likelihood that it will happen again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the 19th century, James Braidwood established what many believe to be the first firefighting brigade in Britain. Because of haphazard and shoddy architectural construction, Edinburgh was prone to constant outbreaks of fires. In 1824, the city fell victim to two such infernos that decimated large portions of the Old Town. Braidwood was appointed by the city council to spearhead what was to become the world's first municipal fire department.

At the age of 24, he was already working as a firefighter, driving the engines that were employed to put out fires. He also worked as a surveyor, giving him expertise in building materials and construction that allowed him to incorporate this knowledge into new fire-fighting techniques. In his capacity as a fire chief, he hired men who had experience working in the fields of building manufacturing, as well as mariners. Both professions had an understanding and practicality that could be incorporated into fire-fighting techniques that are still utilized today.

Unfortunately, he was killed while fighting a fire in his new home in London. In 2008, a statue was erected in the city of his birth, not far from the site of one of the city's most disastrous fires and home to the first fire station. The monument was created by Glaswegian sculptor, Kenneth Mackay, and a plaque reads:

"This statue is dedicated to the memory of James Braidwood, a pioneer of the scientific approach to fire-fighting. It also recognizes the courage and sacrifice of fire-fighters, not only in Lothian & Borders Fire and Rescue Service, but all over the world."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are days when Amadou Ly barely sees the sun. ALF Bakery, located on the subterranean level of Manhattan’s Chelsea Market, opens at 9:00 a.m., but Ly’s day starts hours earlier, in the dark, in his glass-walled work station in front of a piano-sized machine called a dough sheeter.

Lamination, the practice of incorporating layers upon layers of whisper-thin butter into dough, is at the core of much of what Ly does—and it is not a process that can be rushed. Invented in Austria as early as the 13th century, laminated dough took Paris by storm in 1839, when a Viennese artillery officer by the name of August Zang set up a bakery in France. The slightest fluctuations in temperature, humidity, or timing can ruin a batch of croissants in an instant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few sights are as mesmerizing as that of bakers methodically rolling fresh croissants each morning in this glass-encased kitchen hidden in the lower level of Chelsea Market. As with the best Parisian bakeries, ALF releases fresh batches of pastries and breads throughout the day, meaning the kitchen team works near ceaselessly from before dawn until after the bakery closes at 6 p.m.

New York has no shortage of bakeries, but none are quite like this one. In a landscape dominated by brand-name bakers who churn out thousands of loaves, ALF Bakery—short for “Amadou Ly Fancy Bakery”—is a scrappy, independent operation whipping up absurdly high-level baked goods.

The mastermind behind it all is Amadou Ly, who originally hails from Senegal and Togo, journeyed to Barcelona to study chocolate, P…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Castle Video Games, a defunct casino building, definitely stands out in its environment. The castle features a stone exterior, an arched wooden door, a looming knight statue, turrets, and other cliché castle features. Even in its decades-long stretch into neglect, it’s standing strong, and it holds a kind of kitschy allure in its rural South Carolina surroundings. Located right off the highway in the tiny, unassuming town of Blacksburg, South Carolina, it's a weird setting for an even weirder story behind the Castle Video Games building.

Gambling was supposed to be illegal in South Carolina. In fact, gambling was clearly banned in South Carolina, in written law, since 1802. But in 1986, a scheming politician snuck an amendment into a bill that very subtly made gambling legal through the permission of video gambling. Apparently, the state itself didn’t even realize that this had happened until three years later, in 1989. 

Naturally, upon realizing that gambling was accidentally legal again, the early 1990s saw a boom in video poker. Gambling arcades popped up all around South Carolina, located conveniently close to state lines (across which gambling was still actually illegal). Video poker machines were everywhere during this time—you could find people chasing losses in restaurants, gas stations, bowling alleys, and corner stores.

But, of course, all good things must come to an end. In 1999, the South Carolina Supreme Court canceled video poker and banned gambling (again). At the time, it was reportedly a $2.8 billion industry. And just like that, the lights went out at Blacksburg's Castle Video Games. The castle is still there, in pretty great condition, serving as a weird reminder of the time when video poker reigned supreme over the state of South Carolina.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just west of Glasgow's centrally located George Square and City Chambers (where you can visit the building's ornate, marble-clad staircase) is the Merchant City neighborhood. The 30-square-block neighborhood is bounded by Ingram Street to Argyle Street and Queen Street to High Street. Architecturally, the neighborhood is most known for its former 18th- and 19th-century warehouse buildings that have now mostly been refurbished into boutique hotels and upscale retail shops.

In Merchant City, at the intersection of John and Ingram Streets, sits a towering white building known as Hutchesons' Hall. This building once served as both a hospital and school for boys and is named after the two brothers, George and Thomas Hutcheson, who founded it toward the middle of the 1600s. The likelinesses of the two brothers can be found at the entrance of the building. Most local residents, as well as visitors, wouldn't know that these statues have been accidentally switched!

The mix-up happened when the building was undergoing renovation at the beginning of the 1800s. During the construction project, the statues were put into storage. Once the renovation was completed, the best were dusted off and reinstated. But unbeknownst to the workers, the two brothers were returned to the incorrect plinth.

This was not the only error the builders made. George Hutcheson the elder brother was born in 1580 and died in 1639. Unfortunately, a mathematical error was made and the date of his passing was inscribed as 1663—miscalculating his age by nearly three decades! Even though these blunders have been identified, they remain uncorrected to this day.]]></summary>

Destinations are great, but summer road trips are made all the more memorable by the head-turning wonders along the way: outrageously big objects, mesmerizing gas stations, puzzling signs, and more.

There are headstones dedicated to people who died of old age, disease, war, accidents, and other tragic circumstances. But, in the Church Hill Cemetery in Framingham, Massachusetts, there is one remarkably unusual grave that's dedicated to two men from the 18th century who were both killed after being struck by lightning at the exact same time.

There is not much information regarding the backgrounds of John Cloyce and Abraham Rice but it is known that Rice was a Cornet in the British colonial cavalry before the time of his death. According to accounts, on June 3, 1777, several men congregated around a metal fence to see a horse that a local Framingham preacher, Peter Parker, was interested in purchasing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the southeast corner of Spain, the small city of Elche in the province of Alicante is famous for the UNESCO-inscribed Palmeral of Elche, a 10th-century manmade oasis that boasts some 45,000 date palms spread out between 67 orchards. But the Palmeral oasis is far from the only wonder the medieval Arab inhabitants of Elche left behind. Nestled in the city's center, buried underground is an elaborate medieval bath complex known as the Arab Baths (Baños Árabes) or Hammam.

While it's not the only bath complex in Elche, the Arab Baths (built around 1150) are the most remarkable and important in the city, situated close to the medieval mosque and main gate of the town. Today, the baths are located beneath the La Merced Convent (or "Convento de la Merced"), which Clarissa nuns occupied until the city moved the sister into a new convent in 2004.

Since the 13th century, the baths have been repurposed many times. Most recently, the sisters housed a convent store and storage room in the medieval baths. Despite this, the bath themselves have remained remarkably unaltered and are a rare architectural example of Islamic public buildings from the former Islamic territory of Al-Andalus.]]></summary>

The display pool harnesses one of the many hot springs in the area. Gently spilling over a moss-covered rock hill, the water steams into a touch pool, where one can feel the heat of the springs.

Both cascades are must-sees at the national park.  One can even collect the spring water from one of the many public fountains, some tempered, to drink later. Many think the 4,000-year-old water has healing powers.]]></summary>

However, a thunderstorm erupted accompanied by heavy hail. In a rush to seek shelter from the weather, around 2,500 young individuals, crowded into the underpass of the Nemiga metro station. Poor design and the absence of handrails led to individuals slipping on wet tiles. Unaware of the unfolding danger, the pushing crowd sparked a stampede, with the intervening policemen only managing to stop a portion of the crowd.

The stampede resulted in the tragic loss of 53 lives, including two heroic police officers, Foreman Vladimir Govin and Senior Sergeant Gennady Ryabokon. Additionally, over 250 people suffered injuries of varying severity. 

In remembrance of the lives lost in the stampede, a memorial was built outside the Nyamiha metro station. The memorial is a symbol of collective mourning and a solemn dedication to never forget the lives tragically taken too soon. It offers a place for contemplation and paying respects to the victims.]]></summary>

This episode of The Atlas Obscura Podcast transports listeners to the historic Tabor Opera House in Leadville, Colorado. Today, Colorado is a hub for music and performance, but long before anyone appeared live at Red Rocks or made The Fillmore shake, there was the Tabor – which not only staged high dramas, tragedies, and tales of star-crossed lovers…it also inspired an opera of its own.

Host Dylan Thuras explores the story of the Tabor’s enigmatic founder, Horace Tabor, who went from rags to riches in the blink of an eye thanks to the Colorado Silver Boom. Tabor’s meteoric rise brought wealth, political power, and a scandalous love affair with a divorcee 24 years his junior, the famed beauty Elizabeth “Baby Doe” McCourt. But it all came crashing down as quickly as it began, when Horace – and Baby Doe – lost everything, were forced to sell the Tabor Opera House, and died penniless.

Decades later, when the Opera House was threatened with destruction, a Leadville woman named Evelyn Furman came to its rescue, preserving the theater for future generations. Furman also introduced the theater and its fascinating “ghosts” to two American songwriters, who were inspired by the Tabors’ story to pen the opera “The Ballad of Baby Doe.” “The Ballad of Baby Doe” has since become one of the most popularly performed American operas, and the Tabor Opera House – today undergoing extensive renovation – continues to inspire.]]></summary>

So, when he recently glimpsed a very large, rare Wels catfish in the waterways of Utrecht, a small city 25 miles south of Amsterdam, van Rooijen felt some of the old excitement of reeling in a big catch.

This time, though, instead of hauling the trophy fish to shore, van Rooijen courteously rang a virtual “doorbell” on the catfish’s behalf, prompting a worker to open a canal lock and allowing the fish to pass through the waterway unscathed. van Rooijen will do this repeatedly throughout the spring and summer months, and sometimes he’ll go onto Facebook to tell his friends about it. These days, it's safe to say van Rooijen is the one who is hooked…]]></summary>

Singular not only on Pinta but the planet, this last of the Chelonoidis niger abingdonii was dubbed “Lonesome George” and transported to the Charles Darwin Research Station on the nearby island of Santa Cruz, for the safety of the individual and with the aspiration to preserve the subspecies.

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/silver-sands-nashville"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For more than 70 years, regulars have been lining up here five days a week from morning until the tail-end of lunchtime for the classic meat-and-three. Sophia Vaughn, the third woman in her family to run the place, makes everything from scratch daily. Offerings vary depending on the day of the week, but always consist of soul food classics, made with immense care. 

By her own account, Vaughn wakes up at 2 a.m. and starts cooking an hour later in order to have everything ready for the first breakfast customers. Silver Sands Cafe has weathered more than its share over the years, including a tornado in March 2020 that threatened to put it out of business right as the COVID-19 pandemic ramped up. An outpouring of support from the local community helped keep the restaurant afloat.

While part of that loyalty is due to Vaughn, who calls customers her “babies” and knows many by name, much of it is simply because the food is phenomenal. Chitterlings, neck bones, pig’s feet, and other slow-braised cuts are front and center here, along with pork chops, fried catfish, and other rib-sticking fare. The oxtails are tender enough to yield to the gentlest tap of a plastic fork and come swimming in a deeply savory, collagen-rich gravy. 

Don’t sleep on any of the sides, from the collards speckled with generous shards of ham hock to the slightly sticky, impeccably cooked okra to the mac n’ cheese, which has just the right kick of sharp cheddar. After you’ve crafted a plate with a main meat with two sides, they'll ask if you want “hot water” or “flat,” which refers to two different types of cornbread—the former is a torpedo-shaped, skillet-fried cornmeal dumpling; the latter is an oven-baked buttermilk cornbread.

Pay at the front to receive your parcel of treasure, then grab a booth and obliterate it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The M/V Sophie C. makes its waterfront deliveries to the residents of New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee every mail season since 1892, which only lasts from June to September. The seasonal homes across the eight islands are typically starting to close after Labor Day, so the mailboat doesn't have to worry about issues with lake ice.

The mail boat first launched in 1945, and was named after the owner of the Winnipesaukee Flagship Corporation's mother. In 1969, the Sophie C took over the seasonal postal route charged with delivering mail to residents on the western side of Winnipesaukee. 

The Sophie C. stops at Weirs Beach twice a day for passengers and cargo. On the boat, you can purchase historically authentic postage stamps, depicting the vessels. Bear Island has its own outpost on a channel, where the mailboat can be spotted and traditionally waved to as it passes through.

The big sibling vessel to the Sophie C, the well-known Mount Washington Ferry, was used in 1945 by the U.S. Navy in World War II. The Boston Ship amd Engine Works built the Sophie C to temporarily fulfill the need for a ferry service, then adopted the permanent mail route when the Mount Washington returned from its military application.]]></summary>

Some people speak of the night as the time when the stars come out. But they are always out. We are always surrounded by them and among them, even though the star closest to us, the sun, outshines them. I prefer to think of the night as the time when the sun lets its fellow stars have their turn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tucked away on a quiet side street in Fort Worth Texas lies an incredible 200-foot, brightly colored mural. Upon closer inspection, the mural incorporates various mediums to convey the artwork to a group of people that often are unable to partake in art appreciation, the visually impaired.

The mural resides on the side of Lighthouse for the Blind of Fort Worth, whose mission is to empower individuals who are blind and visually impaired to live their highest level of independence.

Auditory devices (usually found at crosswalks) provide audio descriptions, railings include Braille, high-contrast colors, a miniature 3-D model of the entire mural to allow individuals to take in the whole wall at once, and a website accessible by QR code that provides detailed descriptions.]]></summary>

Humans have been raising the young of other animals since long before recorded history. We’ve raised them for food, for friends, and for fun. These days, we’re raising a greater diversity of species, and for a greater diversity of reasons, than ever before. In large part, this diversification is motivated by a better understanding of our impacts on, and interdependence with, all the ecosystems of our planet.

Realizing that we’ve already driven many species to extinction, we design captive breeding programs to try to save the endangered ones. Finding that industrialized farming of m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps one of the last things a visitor might expect to encounter in Eureka, Illinois — a small town of about 5,000 between Peoria and Bloomington — is a four-foot by five foot, 2,200-pound chunk of the Berlin Wall. And yet there it is, a focal point in the Reagan Peace Garden on the campus of Eureka College.

Along with a bronze bust of Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States, the worn gray slab of concrete and rebar commemorates Reagan’s historic commencement address on campus on May 9, 1982, the 50th anniversary of his own graduation from the school. It also recalls Reagan’s 1987 exhortation to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall.”

The 33-inch bust by renowned sculptor Lonnie Stewart sits on a pedestal with quotes from Reagan's 1982 speech, including: “Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with conflict by peaceful means.”

The garden was donated by former Eureka College board chairman David Vaughan and his wife, Anne Vaughan, in 2000.]]></summary>

In this episode of The Atlas Obscura Podcast, we visit a mountaintop near a picturesque Colorado town, where you'll find the frozen corpse of a Norwegian grandpa. We get the tale of how this came to be from the person who for years has trekked up and down the mountain for this unique preservation mission.

Our podcast is an audio guide to the world’s wondrous, awe-inspiring, strange places. In under 15 minutes, we’ll take you to an incredible site, and along the way you’ll meet some fascinating people and hear their stories. Join us daily, Monday through Thursday, to explore a new wonder with cofounder Dylan Thuras and a neighborhood of Atlas Obscura reporters.]]></summary>

Here is one short excerpt: The continued use of Downing Street is an act of pathological national sentimentality, the product of a country that has come to value tradition over function and its past over its future.

What is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? 

One is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. 

Similarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.]]></title>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wait, basketball was invented at a McDonald's!? No, not at all. Well, sorta. I don't know, let me explain: In December of 1891, James Naismith was responsible for the physical education of a group of young men attending the School for Christian Workers in Springfield, Massachusetts. Decembers in Massachusetts are really cold. It was Naismith's job to keep these young men active and engaged within the confines of a modestly-sized gymnasium.

As destiny would have it, he would discover the solution in a pair of peach baskets. 

The School for Christian Workers and the building it occupied would undergo several name changes over generations. The school itself would eventually go on to become Springfield College and move about a half mile down the road. The building, though, the geographical epicenter of the game of basketball, stood on the corner of State and Sherman. But in 1965, it was torn down to make way for a parking lot.

Thirty years later, in 1995, a McDonald's was built on the land. The McDonald's stands to this day at 782 State Street, Springfield, Massachusetts, marking the hallowed ground of the first buckets ever sunk in the history of the universe. In 2010, a monument was erected across the street at Mason Square, commemorating the invention of what is objectively the greatest game ever invented. The monument includes a sculpture depicting an adult passing a basketball to a child, surrounded by plexiglass displays illustrating the history of basketball. 

So, if you happen to be rolling through Springfield, you can drop in and grab a Big-Mac and just consider that you are standing on the spot where James Naismith first unveiled the game that would go on to become one of the most widely appreciated sports on the planet.]]></summary>

In that story, life started long ago on some planet Eden, which then via panspermia seeded life onto thousands of planets in Earth’s stellar nursery. One of those other planets reached our current advanced level probably at least a hundred of million years ago, after which it enforced a policy preventing any part of it from expanding to colonize the universe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as the eye can see, across some parts of the scrubby desert of Western Australia, there are round, barren patches of land. They’re seen in Namibia and Angola, too: fairy circles. They got that name in 2000, in a paper published in Basic & Applied Ecology by Thorsten Becker and Stephan Getzin. The German scientists described them as “circular or sub-circular patches devoid of any vegetation,” but “fairy circles” carries a little more magic.

Their round shape, uniform size, and lack of obvious explanation have made them a longstanding mystery of the natural world. “One of the [other] key signatures of fairy circles is that they have a so-called spatially periodic pattern,” says Getzin, of the University of Göttingen. In other words, the circles are more or less evenly spaced out amo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switzerland is known for several literary pilgrimage sites for fans of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium. He traveled here when he was 19 years old, and it is said that some of the Alpine villages he visited served as inspirations behind some of Middle-earth's iconic landscapes, such as Rivendell and the Misty Mountains. But the country has another can't-miss to offer to The Lord of the Rings enthusiasts, if not personally associated with Tolkien like the others.

In the winemaking village of Jenins stands a familiar-looking building, a leaf-covered cottage with a green round door. This is the Greisinger Museum, home to the largest Tolkien-related collection in the world.

Starting off as the private collection of Bernd Greisinger, the construction of the museum took place between 2008 and 2013 when it opened to the public. All of its rooms are inspired by and themed after Middle-earth locations. For instance, one of them copies the interior design of Bag End, the iconic home of Bilbo Baggins.

The museum's collection consists of more than 25,000 items, including a myriad of movie memorabilia and hundreds of original paintings by such renowned artists as Alan Lee, Roger Garland, and Ted Nasmith. It is also home to a copy of every impression of the UK first editions of The Lord of the Rings, as well as that of The Hobbit from 1937 to 1999, some of them very rare and signed.]]></summary>

The common tern was the first summer resident to arrive at a seasonal colony, and the scientists monitoring the site celebrated. Soon, more terns joined OH1, and nesting season was officially underway.

Then, within days, uninvited guests started showing up. Young gulls of different species began to loiter in the area, “just looking for a place to hang out,” says biologist Archer Larned, coastal bird habitat coordinator at the Maryland Coastal Bays Program (MCBP). Eventually, more than 100 of the noisy, pushy teenagers threatened to transform the terns’ breeding colony into their own s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Driving down a gravel road in rural Missouri, the last thing you would expect to see are several pair of shoes dangling above your windshield, but this is exactly what you will encounter while driving down this rural Perry County road. 

The tree is just on the north side of the roadside ditch on County Road 324.  The origins stem from a trip taken in the early 2000s by the landowners to the state of Nevada where they encountered a similar tree with many pair of shoes dangling from the branches.

The man chose a tree close to the road on his property and flung a pair of shoes in it. At family gatherings, he encouraged his descendants to do the same. Now it has become a point of curiosity.

There are so many shoes in the tree it would be difficult to count. Some people make a wish before throwing their shoes, others write messages on their shoes like "self-doubt," "weight troubles," or a bible verse. The various types of shoes in the tree show a variety of footwear worn by the throwers. There are football cleats, running shoes, work boots, and basically anything that can catch itself on a branch in the tree.  Then there is the act of throwing, which is the best for getting the shoes attached without spending all day throwing them up in the air only to see them fall back down.]]></summary>

The statue is not part of a temple complex or a garden. Instead, it is perched on top of a concrete shelter filled with dumpsters, in an office parking lot.

Its origins are a mystery, but it must have been quite the feat to transport and situate the massive statue on top of the concrete shelter. It faces away from the parking lot and gazes out over the freeway.

Despite the unusual location, the statue has become a site of worship. Visitors leave gifts along the statue's base, ranging from bottles of water to sticks of incense. Most drivers rushing through their commutes below likely have no idea that the watchful Buddha is sitting in such a humble spot.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Walking through the bustling Cape Town waterfront, you will see many old and new buildings, many of which have a maritime history. Perhaps one of the most important of these buildings is a tiny unsuspecting tower with a large ball on top of it. 

This tower, aptly called the Time Ball Tower, is an 1894 time device similar to the one in the Greenwich Observatory in the United Kingdom, which was used to give a visual signal of the time to ships in the bay, as this was much more accurate than an auditory signal like those of the noon gun, simply because sound travels much slower than light. This was a vital task, as a ship's clock (or chronometer) was needed for navigation, and any drifts could blow a ship off course or worse.  

The tower was initially built on the former Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, but an 1860s expansion of the harbor obscured the old tower, which created the need for a new one. Initially this was a wooden tower, which was later replaced by the current model in 1894, which remained in use for another 40 years. 

Since then the need for time balls dwindled, and so did their maintenance. The tower was used for a while as a signal repeater for the area, until it was declared a monument and restored in 1997. Since then the time ball has been operational again, and used on occasion.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An institution in the urban landscape of the center of Madrid, the San Ginés Book Shop is still going strong. This open-air bookstore is steeped in history.

A stone's throw from one of the most famous places in Madrid for churros with chocolate is this picturesque bookstore. The San Ginés Book Shop is actually one of the oldest bookshops in Spain. It is situated in the scenic Pasadizo de San Ginés, between Calle Arenal and Calle Mayor, near the parish of the same name and Chocolatería de San Ginés

Its beginnings can be traced to the 17th century when Diego Logroño, the first known bookseller, started his business in 1650.

Old and used books are the store's expertise. Unique and exceptional copies are blended with city guides and political references on the tables set up at a street level, which—combined with the fantastic opportunities at reasonable prices—make this book sanctuary a haven for both collectors and curious shoppers.]]></summary>

In 2018, news spread around Saroj Duru’s village that four elephants had gathered at a nearby lake. Such creatures didn’t typically visit her region in central India—they were known to stay further north in more forested habitats—and so, out of curiosity, Duru and her neighbors walked down to see them.

The elephants rested in the water as people jostled at the shore, trying to get a closer look. Others climbed trees for a better view. After an hour of savoring the thrill of seeing such large animals, Duru headed back home. She was not sure when she would see them again.

Instead, that same day, a herd rampaged through the village’s farms. “They tore our boundary wall and tore up…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just outside Belfast on the N4 highway sits this piercing war memorial. The monument was built in 1970 as a replacement for the original, much smaller, monument that was placed in 1930.

This piercing, brutalist piece commemorates the Battle of Bergendal which took place in  August 1900. Thousands of British and Boer forces battled in what was the last set-piece battle of the Second Boer War. The battle resulted in the retreat of the Boer forces, more than 400 casualties, and Lord Roberts declaring the entire South African Republic as British territory. 

The site is difficult to miss when passing from either direction on the N4. An additional monument sitting behind the main one also commemorates the lives of the British forces that were lost. There is some signage giving background on the events of the battle, but due to sun damage, it's difficult to read. The names of the lives lost on both sides remain forged on granite plaques around the memorial.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cine Doré, inaugurated in 1912, is a modernist building that holds 1,250 spectators. The building underwent its first of many renovations in 1923 by architect Críspulo Moro Cabeza.

The building lost part of its original glamor during the late 1930s and became a rather unattractive place, and for some time it was even known as the Sunflower Palace. 

The façade is in a modernist style with six Ionic columns and a medallion surrounded by flowers. The Municipal Corporation acquired the cinema in 1982 and the Ministry of Culture used it as a stable location for projections for the Spanish Film Library.

The restoration by architect Javier Feduchi began in 1982 and ended in 1989, with the cinema inaugurated on February 28 of the same year. There are two theories about the origins of the name, one attributing it to a tribute to Gustave Doré and the other to the first two musical notes.

Its most recent restoration was led by the architect Javier Feduchi, who preserved the decorative and architectural elements of the old building adding a second room at the bottom.

Since 1989, the Doré Cinema has served as the Spanish Film Library's projection space. It is used for both its programming and a variety of outreach initiatives that promote Spanish cinematography and cinema in general.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-06-05T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a lot of historic landmarks in Vientiane remain in their original forms, having been numerous wars and invasions—particularly the Siamese onslaught of 1827 and the Indochina Wars that lasted for 55 years. A few exceptions are Wat Si Saket, a Buddhist temple built in 1818, and That Dam, an ancient stupa steeped in legend.

Standing in the center of a roundabout near the Talat Sao morning market, the stupa is believed to be around 500 years old, though the exact date of construction remains uncertain. The name That Dam (not that dam) means “black tower” in Lao, based on its current status. However, it was not always darkened and overrun with weeds; local legends claim that it was once gilded over and that the gold was all stripped away by the Siamese invaders.

Generally, stupas are built to enshrine Buddhist relics, most often the ashes of monks and nuns, sometimes of kings. In the case of That Dam, it is unknown what is buried inside, but locals whisper of an intriguing legend. According to them, lying dormant underneath the stupa is the Naga, a seven-headed serpent that will awaken whenever Vientiane faces a crisis. Many of them believe that it has protected the city from the 1827 invasion, as well as on other historical occasions.

The stupa has fallen into disrepair since the Naga last showed itself, weather-worn and all but neglected, but there are still believers in the powerful serpent. In fact, some locals seem to continue to visit the ancient monument to dedicate flowers to the forgotten guardian of Vientiane, in hopes that its peaceful slumber will never again be disturbed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Among the many museums in Sarajevo dedicated to the three-year siege of the city in the 1990s, the War Childhood Museum stands out for its unique focus on the children who experienced it firsthand.

In this museum, there are no dry historical descriptions to be found—all the stories are told by the former children themselves. The exhibit contains 50 personal items belonging to locals who were children during the Siege of Sarajevo, ranging from toys to school books to emergency ration kits. Each object is connected to a story or memory from the war, which is told by its owner over a personal audioguide.

The War Childhood Museum is an intimate and emotional look at how children of various ages experience growing up in a warzone. Aside from the permanent exhibition in Sarajevo, the museum also engages in research and advocacy work, including projects with children in Syria and Ukraine.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Karl Marx’s high academic stature outside of economics diverges sharply from his peripheral influence within the discipline, particularly after nineteenth-century developments rendered the labor theory of value obsolete. We hypothesize that the 1917 Russian Revolution is responsible for elevating Marx into the academic mainstream. Using the synthetic control method, we construct a counterfactual for Marx’s […]

Hm, I can't figure out what it should be either.  I also found it on the web, and kept a copy in case it disappears.  I tried to contact the author via a webform, but it didn't work.  I've removed the link from the bibliography, but really wish there could be a canonical source.  If I could contact the author, I'd recommend that he post it on the arXiv, where it could be preserved for posterity.]]></summary>

No, that makes sense!   You're right; I've removed the "set brackets" and hope that what I mean will be clear.  If you think another wording is better, please feel free to suggest something.]]></summary>

Thanks!  That was subtle, and resulted from some much-earlier changing of notation of "b" to "g".  And then your comment made me realized that there were several related infelicities near there too, caused by the same change.  Now fixed.]]></summary>

Along with the top quark there are three other heavyweight particles that we currently call elementary -perhaps only a label we have to use because we haven't been able to split them further into smaller bits: the Higgs boson (125 GeV), the Z boson (91 GeV), and the W boson (80 GeV).<p><a href="https://www.science20.com/tommaso_dorigo/a_w_a_z_and_a_top_quark-256648" target="_blank">read more</a></p></div></div>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this post is to present a simple formula for fairly pricing options, called the binomial options pricing model (Cox et al., 1979; Rendleman, 1979). This is sometimes called the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model (CRR) after the authors’ surnames in (Cox et al., 1979). I like this model because it is a simple, discrete-time model that captures much of the intuition behind how to price options, while avoiding much of the mathematical machinery needed for a continuous-time treatment or Black–Scholes (Black &amp; Scholes, 1973). Learning the binomial model is like climbing a smaller, easier mountain that gives views that are almost as good as its larger, more intimidating neighbor. As we will see, despite its simplicity this model introduces many important concepts from the options-pricing literature such as the no-arbitrage condition, pricing via replication, and the risk-neutral measure. And it does so without any advanced mathematics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Between Nashville’s iconic Music Row and Vanderbilt University, Sarabha's Creamery, the city's first homemade Indian-style ice cream shop, quietly works sweet, frozen magic from the second story of a nondescript strip mall. It’s the passion project of husband-and-wife duo Gursharan Singh and Manpreet Gill, who opened the parlor in 2022 after leaving jobs in tech. As Gill explained in an interview with Nashville Scene, the pair saw the empty storefront and decided to make the switch almost immediately. 

The mango kulfi—reminiscent of a tropical creamsicle—is the perfect starter to a multi-course ice cream feast, and comes in flavors like malai (with cardamom and milk solids) and kesar pista (saffron with pistachios). It melts quickly, so it’s both logistically sound and extremely satisfying to lick it off the stick as quickly as possible. 

The rest of the ice creams are equally stellar. Sarabhas’s incorporates less air into its Indian-style ice cream than a typical American scoop, giving it a texture more akin to gelato. Pair flavors such as rose tutti frutti, cardamom-scented Indian coffee, and paan nawabi (made with rose petals and cashews) in a crispy waffle cone or bowl, then wash it all down with a steaming masala chai.

Visually, the star of the show is Sarabhas' vibrant falooda, which arrives brimming with malai ice cream, sweet basil seeds, vermicelli noodles, and jellied fruit bobbing a cup of ice-cold milk, all finished with a cherry and a swirl of fuchsia rose syrup. Originally invented in Persia more than 2,500 years ago, faloodeh is a dessert made from frozen vermicelli soaked in a rose syrup. Persians began arriving in India during the 8th century, so faloodeh had plenty of time to catch on, attain royal status, and then morph into a popular milkshake-like dessert, all while retaining almost exactly the same name—falooda.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First housed inside an old mule-pulled trolley car, Brown’s Diner has changed hands three times since 1927 without losing its charm or its original ethos. Customers now have the option to dine on a covered patio area next to the old trolley, but the interior of the diner remains a time warp. 

The concise menu sticks to the classics—Frito chili pies, wings, fried chicken plates—and does them well. But the cheeseburger, Brown's claim to fame, is what an old-school fast food burger aspires to be: a slender patty with a hint of char on the outside and a pink interior, blanketed in American cheese and Duke’s mayo. It costs less than $10, tastes like a million bucks, and can (and should) be ordered alongside a basket of ultra-crispy Tater Tots.

The diner also bears the unusual distinction of having Nashville’s oldest beer license. Throughout its lifetime, generations of recording artists—from John Prine to Vince Gill—have played on its small stage and knocked back a cold one at the bar.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During the final years of World War II, the Nazis forced thousands of prisoners to carve out an elaborate system of tunnels under Silesia's Owl Mountains. Almost all documentation related to the project was destroyed before the German surrender, meaning that the purpose and the true extent of these tunnels, codenamed Project "Riese" (or "Giant"), remain shrouded in mystery to this day.

The secret tunnels under Silesia have attracted numerous treasure hunters over the years, convinced that somewhere under this low mountain range lies a trove of Nazi loot. Theories about the true purpose of the Silesian tunnels range from a secret underground train system to transport stolen gold and other treasures, to the final hiding place of the Amber Room, to a covert weapons lab working on the "Wunderwaffe," a top-secret new weapon under development by the Nazis.

Most historians now believe that the tunnels were probably an attempt to move key factories underground and away from Allied bombing raids, but this hasn't stopped others from searching further. The full extent of the Nazi tunnel system under Silesia has yet to be uncovered, and the region continues to attract treasure hunters from all over the world, looking for new stores of Nazi gold.

The tunnels were abandoned after the war, and for several decades, only experienced cavers and treasure hunters dared to explore the many underground complexes dug out during Project Riese. Beginning in the 2000s, however, many known sections of the tunnels have been secured and opened to the public. The most famous of the Silesian tunnels are the ones under Ksiaz castle, but more than a dozen other self-contained tunnel systems have been discovered throughout the Owl Mountains, notably in the modern Polish towns of Osówka, Rzeczka/Walim, Soboń, Jawornik, and Włodarz.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The biscuits arrive in an unassuming disposable box, still gently warm and roughly the size of a softball. Served with honey butter, jam, and tangy-sweet house-made curd, they’re already superb, but used as the vehicle for a breakfast sandwich, they’re transcendent. From the fried chicken and waffles to the shrimp and grits, there’s no dead weight on the short, sharp menu at Yay Yay’s, but if you only have stomach capacity for one item, a biscuit needs to be a part of it.  

Chef Charlotte Miller, who built up a reputation through catering for years, opened her first brick-and-mortar along with her business partner Jason Luntz in 2022. From its location on Jefferson Street, a historic commerce hub, to the wall murals, to the thoughtfully curated selection of books by Michael Twitty, Toni Tipton-Martin, and others, every facet of her café is a celebration of Black history and culture in Nashville. The airy, welcoming interior is ideal for a leisurely brunch or afternoon tea.

The “Can You Say Yay Yay?” with fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, and pimiento cheese on a biscuit is absolutely as much of a triple-threat as it sounds like. The whole concoction is structurally unsound in the right way, with a biscuit crumb so ethereal that it begins to disintegrate almost as soon as it hits your fingers. You won’t mind—the messy sense of immediacy of this sandwich is part of its allure.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tinside Lido is a famous outdoor swimming pool complex located on the waterfront in Plymouth. It holds historical significance as a Grade II listed building, adorning the city's edge to the English Channel. 

The lido was opened in 1935 having been designed by the architect John Wibberley. It features an iconic Art-Deco style, with sleek lines, curved edges, and a stunning white façade. The design was influenced by the "ocean liner aesthetic" renowned during that era, with many of the U.K.'s seaside towns building lidos in the 1930s as an ode to the rise of popularity in sport and fitness. What makes this lido a must-visit is its heritage and beautiful curves, telling of history in its peeling paint and quaint 30s signage.

Over the years, Tinside Lido has undergone periods of closure and renovation to maintain its historic charm and functionality. Like other lidos, it has had periods when it was abandoned and out of use. Fortunately, Plymouth's Tinside Lido is one of the lucky lidos that has not been subject to demolition.

In 2003, the Tinside Lido underwent a major restoration, preserving its original features while incorporating modern facilities and amenities. Since then, it is functional in the summer months as a full-blown swimming pool that can be entered with a small fee.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 1944, the Jewish people in Budapest, much like those before them in major cities across Europe, were forced to live in a small 20-block area of the 7th district. Many tourists today will learn about the plight of Hungary's Jewish citizens through the history of the Dohány Street Synagogue (The Great Synagogue), the Holocaust Memorial, and the Hungarian Jewish Museum. There are also some more subtle remnants of the impact of the Nazi pogrom on the people of Budapest, if you know where to look.

One of the more hidden memorials isn't entirely authentic, but its location is. The wall surrounding the Jewish ghetto was erected in November 1944 and destroyed in 2006. However, the 30-meter section that sits at the back of the courtyard at 15 Király Utca was reconstructed in 2010 (minus the original barbed wire) to serve as a permanent reminder of the tens of thousands who were forced to live in the area. You can find carefully placed stones and votive lamps along the wall in memory of the people who were interred there.

A small plaque on the street describes the memorial wall in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew. Getting to the wall itself requires entering the courtyard of the private apartments currently occupying the location. Pass through the courtyard and continue out through the short tunnel to a second courtyard to find the remains of the wall and a small plaque showing a map of the original ghetto.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After World War I, the 1919 Treaty of Versailles brought the Polish state back into existence after 123 years of division and occupation by the Prussian, Austrian, and Russian empires, formalizing the borders of this resurrected Poland by carving out territory from these three failing imperial powers.

Poland's new border was moved even further west after World War II, but during the interwar period between 1919 and 1939, its border with Germany followed more or less the same course as the provincial delimitation between modern Poland's Lubusz and Wielkopolska Voivodeships. This former international border is today overgrown with thick forests that conceal many old, fortified border crossings and bunkers which have become popular landmarks for local hikers.

Only one of the original border markers from the Versailles era has survived to the present day, and it stands in a public park in the Polish village of Wierzbno. It's engraved with the date of the Versailles Treaty—June 28, 1919—as well as a "P" for Poland and a "D" for Deutschland (Germany). The actual border crossing was located about one kilometer further east along Poland's national road 24 where the Lubusz Voivodeship meets the Wielkopolska Voivodeship, and is commemorated with a small monument, an information board, and some crumbling ruins of the customs buildings that used to stand there.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As temperatures start to rise and beaches start to fill, it seems summer has officially arrived—bring on the backyard barbecues and picture-perfect picnics (perhaps in a secluded Georgian graveyard)! This year at Atlas Obscura, we’re doing the sunny season a little differently. With the launch of our ongoing Summer of Wonder series, we’re delving into the marvels of the night sky, whimsical tales of the road, and curious animals we might encounter along the way.

To celebrate this time of longer days and shorter pants, we recently asked readers on our Facebook page to tell us about their favorite spots to soak up the sun, unique summer traditions, the festival treats they can’t wait to try, and the summer adventures they’re planning. We collected some of our favorite responses below, from…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situated within the Fremantle Cemetery lies the final resting place of Ronald Belford "Bon" Scott, lead vocalist of the popular rock band AC/DC.

Bon was born on July 9, 1946, in a town north of the Scottish city of Dundee. (You can find a bronze statue of the singer in Kirriemuir, where he spent the first few years of his life.) In 1952, at the age of six, he migrated to Australia with his family. They lived in Melbourne for a time before relocating to the Perth suburb of Fremantle.

In 1974, he was asked to join the band AC/DC by Malcolm and Angus Young, two brothers from Glasgow and over a period of six years, Scott reached world fame through his performances as the lead singer of the band. 

On February 19, 1980, Scott tragically passed away after leaving a nightclub and later falling asleep in his friend's car, with the coroner determining the cause of death to be acute alcohol poisoning. Scott's body was embalmed and his family decided to scatter his ashes at this site in Fremantle Cemetery. The memorial site includes a plaque and memorial bench and due to his contributions to the field of music, the National Trust of Australia has deemed this a site of cultural significance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The history of Trutnov is intimately bound with dragons, as even the shortest term visitor will notice. Dragons adorn businesses throughout the city center and comprise some of the city's most prominent statues. Depending on the time of year, you may even be lucky enough to see one hoisted from city hall.

According to local legend, in 1006, shortly after Trutnov was founded, two stonecutters stumbled upon a dragon's den while searching the woods for building materials. They rushed back to town and informed a local knight, Lord Albrecht von Trautenberg. Although he was skeptical of their story, he went to investigate it for himself, bringing with him several men from the town armed with rope nooses to capture the beast. Using a lamb as bait, they lured the dragon from its lair and were able to subdue it before suffocating it to death with smoke. The dragon was then skinned, stuffed, and hung in the town square.

In thanks to Lord Albrecht, the new city was supposedly named in his honor (Trautenau), and was later adapted into Czech as 'Trutnov'. Legend also has it that the stuffed dragon was gifted to Brno, and continues to hang in its city hall.

Every year in the first weekend of May, the residents of Trutnov commemorate the slaying of the dragon in a ceremony called Už ho nesou ("They are already carrying him"), in which a tin dragon is symbolically hoisted up onto the facade of the city hall in the main square, where it remains until September or October. The ceremony itself is accompanied by a large public festival with food, drinks, and medieval costumes. Outsiders are rare, but are more than welcome.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the 1950s, the site now known as Riker Hill Art Park was used as a United States Army Nike Missile Tracking Base. Its location, the highest elevation in the county, offered the perfect clear line defense against anyone attempting to target the New York Metro area.

By the 1970s, due to advancements in weapons systems, these measures became obsolete, and in 1974, the base, known as Riker Hill Nike Battery Control Area NY-80, was sold to the county for $1. For a short time, the site was used to showcase dinosaur fossils that had been found nearby, in a quarry. But there was little interest from the public, and this was also closed down.

Shortly after, the former army barracks were transformed into 38 artist studios, with the spaces now being used for various disciplines, such as sculpture, painting, photography, glass blowing, pottery, printmaking, ceramics, and more.

Each of the buildings is painted a different color. Whilst taking a stroll around the 42-acre complex you can enjoy the scenic overlooks, check out the large metal sculptures, and also see if you can spot any military remnants.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The more we know of outer space, the less inviting it seems. The Moon is not made of cheese. At -445 °F (-265 °C), the temperature is more than a bit chilly. And no one can hear you scream.

As space photography confirms, the universe beyond the troposphere is harsh and unforgiving. Our mechanical telescopes and satellite cameras capture a cold, impersonal place. Starkly beautiful sometimes, but instantly lethal always—not somewhere you would want to go on a Sunday picnic.


How different is this mid-19th century display of Comets and Aerolites. It presents these heavenly bodies—“aerolite” is a now obsolete term for meteorite—in warm colors and animate shapes. Perhaps because they are drawn by human hand, they somehow appear less uninviting, as if they are the sea creatures you would ho…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The waters off the coast of southwestern England are notoriously treacherous. For centuries, sailors who attempted to navigate the currents found themselves dashed against the rugged coastline of Cornwall and entrapped by the submerged rocks that guard the Isles of Scilly; some 1,000 vessels are believed to lie beneath the waves around the islands today. Thanks to one family—five generations of the Gibsons of Scilly—there is a photographic record of hundreds of these dramatic shipwrecks and the heroic efforts undertaken by locals to save the crews and retrieve their cargo.

“Within the photographs, you have stories of rescue and salvage and plunder,” says Jeremy Michell, a curator at the National Maritime Museum in London. A decade ago, the museum acquired about 1,800 images from the fami…]]></summary>

We find (like others) that the abundances can be explained pretty precisely with only two processes. My position (contrary to others) is that this is  because there are two dominant kinds of supernovae! It is because the disk mixes gas quickly in the azimuthal direction, such that a star's properties are mainly set by the (cosmic) time at which it was born, and the radius at which it was born. If I'm right, then you can't really use disk stars to understand process yields, since they are always an ugly mixture of processes. If I am wrong, there's lots more to do!realAPOGEEnot]]></summary>

L'Art de la cuisine cambodgienne, or The Culinary Art of Cambodia, was an extensively researched, beautifully illustrated tome years in the making. It came at a pivotal moment, just seven years after Cambodia declared independence, when the nation was fighting to codify an identity beyond that of its former French-colonial rulers.

Only a few years after the princess’s death in 1971, civil war ripped Khmer society apart. The Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Prime Minister Pol Pot, purged Cambodia’s artists and intellectuals, along with records that detailed much of what came before “Year Zero” on April 17, 1975.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adjacent to Prague Castle, the hill of Petřín presents a panoramic view of the city and boasts numerous attractions, including a funicular, an observatory, a 19th-century mirror maze, and a haunting memorial dedicated to the victims of Communism. Up on the green slopes, there is also a historic monument dating back to the Middle Ages: the Hunger Wall of Prague.

Built by the order of Charles IV, the first King of Bohemia to become the Holy Roman Emperor, the defensive wall was completed in 1362, built out of marlstone quarried from Petřín Hill. Originally up to 4.5 meters (14 feet) tall, the wall is believed to have been constructed to strengthen Prague Castle's defenses. It has been renovated multiple times throughout history, particularly in 1624 and recently in 1975.

As suggested by its evocative name, the wall comes with a story. It was originally referred to as Zubatá ("toothed") after its bastioned appearance, but soon people started calling it Chlebová ("for bread") or Hladová ("hungry") following the famine in 1361. The construction provided a great deal of labor for the people of Prague, giving them a job and, thus, bread to live on.

According to local folklore, this was the very purpose of the wall's construction in the first place, rather than the city's defense. Later historians, in the 15th and 16th centuries, also claimed that King Charles IV himself visited the construction site every day and even worked with his people, whom he called his dear family, for several hours a day.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An exceptional vignette of Danish food and drink, this spot keeps the local schnapps flowing alongside seafood-focused open face sandwiches that are emblematic of the region. Since 1877, Restaurant Schønnemann has built up a deserved reputation for serving some of the finest smoørrebrød in the capital. The menu allows for easy sampling of signature local flavors, including the sweeter smaller shrimp found in this part of the world. 

In a dish this simple, details are everything and they're fastidiously on-point here. Silky smoked salmon, smoked eel tartare, and white fish sit atop the Danish canvas of rye cradled by kitschy fishy themed porcelain. The bread is baked in house, many of the cheeses are aged in nearby caves, and the herring is cured and aged by the expert chefs. The dark-wood interior has an air of Old World grandeur, making for an especially atmospheric lunch.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alongside an old Roman and Celtic road in Luxembourg stands a marker honoring a mysterious figure known as "the Dead Woman." Also known as Doudeg Fra or La Femme Morte, the origins of this marker aren't entirely clear.

One theory is that the site was a location for an ancient sanctuary dedicated to the Roman goddess Diana or to the Alma Mater, a religious symbol of fertility.

Another interpretation of the “Dead Woman” is that it represents Elisabeth of Görlitz (1391–1451). In 1388, King Wencelaus pledged the territory of Luxembourg for his debts against his cousin Jobst of Moravia. After his death in 1409, his widow Elisabeth of Görlitz had been the only Pawnee of Luxembourg. To pay off the debts of her deceased husband, Elisabeth had to sell Luxembourg to the Duke Philippe of Burgundy in 1441.

According to ancient records from the Heiliggeist Monastery, the sale took place at the exact location of the Dead Woman monument using a traditional sales ritual called "hand hitting," where the seller holds a branch and a handful of soil in their hand and a buyer must hit the seller’s hand until they drop the branch and soil. Legend says that immediately after the sale was completed, Elisabeth of Görlitz said “Now I am a dead woman.” It's unclear what Elisabeth meant by this and whether her use of the word "dead" should be understood to mean she was “done,” “ineffectual,” or “worthless.” According to tradition, it's custom to leave offerings of branches at this location and place them with the words “This is for the dead woman.”

Until the middle of the 20th century, Doudeg Fra was marked by a crucifix perched on several stone blocks. However, in 1982 this was replaced by the current marker, which features a carved crucifix scene.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crvenkapa ("Little Red Riding Hood") is the nickname of the YU Bizniz Centar complex in Blok 12 of Novi Beograd. This business, residential, and shopping complex on Bulevar Mihajla Pupina earned its nickname thanks to its striking red details in contrast to the building's white facade. After initial designs in the 1990s, it appeared in Belgrade in the early 2000s.

Known as "the building with sails", the YUBC, known earlier as the NBG Centar, had once been considered one of the most luxurious residential buildings for social housing. Designed by the Serbian architect Mario Jobst with GP Energoprojekt as the investor and contractor, the settlement was built in a supposedly Mediterranean style and served as an artistic expression of the architect who is known to emphasize red in his constructions. Having been inspired by the Danube as well as the sails of ships, Jobst sought to display ornamentation in a part of the city predominantly defined by grey Brutalism.  

On the ground, it is unmissable to the foreign eye. Being quite a big complex, you will be able to observe a plethora of "futuristic" glass, concrete, red, and green elements.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After the Caribbean coast, cenotes are likely the most recognizable natural features of the Yucatan Peninsula. These sinkholes come in several shapes and sizes, and their importance was recognized by the indigenous Maya peoples, not only as freshwater sources but also for their belief systems. A certain cenote has even gained the name of "Pet Cemetery" due to the large number of animal bones found at its bottom. Many other cenotes are known for their wealth of religious offerings such as jewelry.

Ziiz Ha ("cold waterwell" in Yucatec Mayan) currently stands on the grounds of the Catholic convent of San Bernardino de Siena, built in the mid-16th century, and is covered by a colonial stone structure that appears to be a well. Even with this construction, which obstructs access to the cenote's waters even more than the natural cave above it already did, Ziiz Ha has been explored by diving archaeologists for decades.

Rather than pre-Columbian jewelry or prehistoric animal bones, what they have found here dates to the Colonial era that defines its architectural surroundings. Weapons, most of them artillery, dating from the 18th and 19th centuries were a bulk of the findings. The origins of these firearms, cannonballs, and similar objects represent the Colonial history of the region, as they include not only Spanish examples but also several British ones. This is due to the production of weapons in the British Empire, as well as their arming of troops and civilians in colonies.

The weapons were discarded either to keep them away from enemy hands or just to get rid of them. The huge haul of colonial war artifacts found in the cenote represents an important archaeological heritage.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opened in May 2022, this is the first museum in the United Kingdom solely focused on queer history. It was founded by Ian Mehrtens and Joseph Galliano in response to the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which ended the criminalization of homosexuality in England and Wales. This space was created for queer people to remember their struggles, find their communities and celebrate their success.

The collection includes the door to the prison cell of Oscar Wilde in Reading Gaol, the iconic top hat of Anne Lister aka "Gentleman Jack," and a dress from the legendary drag performer Divine.

The museum is spread across two floors with gallery spaces, exhibition areas, and a small store. Talks, events, and new exhibitions are filled with growing enthusiastic energy and plans for the expansion of the collection.]]></summary>

As the murmur of conversation spilling out of local restaurants blends with children’s laughter from the nearby playground, something magically mundane is about to happen. It starts around sunset with the clicking sound of the neighborhood’s beloved gas lamps firing up. Then comes the familiar golden glow Berliners have lived by for nearly two centuries.

But these scenes are fading fast in the city home to more than half the world’s working gas streetlamps. Since 2011, the German city has been working on converting them to LED alternatives—a process brought back into sharp focus by climate change and Russia’s war against Ukraine—leaving conservationists feeling that Berlin is losing something with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[U.S. Highway 97 extends from Weed, California, up to the Canadian border. It runs along the eastern side of the Cascades and is a major north-south route that has become more important with the burgeoning development in eastern Oregon and Washington. Indeed, it has become an alternate trucking route to Interstate-5. Traditionally called The Dalles-California highway in Oregon, it goes directly through Bend, now the largest population center in Oregon east of the Cascades.

About 2.5 miles north of Terrebonne, Oregon US-97 crosses the Crooked River on a high bridge over the Crooked River Gorge. The current span, the Rex T. Barber Veteran Memorial Bridge, was completed in 2000. It is a concrete arch with a span of 410 feet (125 meters) some 300 feet (91 meters) above the river, which places it 22nd in height among U.S. bridges. It replaced the Crooked River High Bridge, which had become inadequate with the increasing traffic on the highway. The High Bridge was built in 1926 and consists of a steel arch with a main span 330 feet (100 meters) long. About 350 feet downstream of the current bridge, it has been preserved for foot traffic, and is the second-highest span to be converted to pedestrian use after Navajo Bridge in Arizona.

A railroad bridge crosses the gorge about 850 feet downstream of the High Bridge. Built in 1911, it consists of a two-hinge arch with a span of 460 feet (140 meters). Both highway bridges mimicked the arch design of the original railroad bridge for aesthetic reasons. This bridge, now part of the BNSF Railway system, is still in use.]]></summary>

Access to additional federal loans increased graduate students’ borrowing and shifted the composition of their loans from private to federal debt. However, the increase in borrowing limits did not improve access to existing programs […]

When the school was decommissioned, it was shortlisted as a potential site for an African American museum by a task force assembled in 1984 by then-mayor Charles Royer, which was planning for such a museum.

However, an expansion to Interstate-90, which now runs underground beneath the building, threatened to result in the building's demolition. A subgroup of the museum task force, consisting of Omari Tahir Garrett, Michael Greenwood, Earl Debnam, and Charlie James, broke into the building in November 1985 with the intention of occupying it until its future could be secured.

Located in Inari, a remote municipality in Finland’s northernmost Sápmi region, the acclaimed restaurant inside the Hotel Kultahovi draws inspiration from traditional northern foods and relies on the surrounding countryside for ingredients.

Chef Dāvis Sausnītis’s team cooks with meats like reindeer, whitefish, Arctic char, and lake trout, and scours dense woodlands for seasonal fare ranging from berries and leaves to mushrooms and mosses. But one evergreen ingredient that finds its way onto the menu are the forest’s trees themselves: pine needles and shoots, pinecones, and even ground pine bark are incorporated into entrees, desserts, drinks, and condiments, providing guests with a particularly pungent taste…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What girl would not want to get a devotion of love in the form of a road in her name? Like a 19th-century graffiti, local legend has it that the "M"—that stands out on a straight road that could have continued straight towards the mountain—was created by an Austro-Hungarian engineer Josip Slade-Šilović who was in love with a Montenegrin princess called Milena.

Tasked with designing a modern road for cars from Kotor to Cetinje following the Berlin Congress in 1878, this designer from Trogir was later a palace builder and created a rut in the road with an "M" symbol. Montenegrin writer Jovan J. Martinović has since passed on the joke of the people of Cetinje, which was created at the expense of this letter M: "And imagine if he accidentally fell in love with Princess Olga—the road wouldn't end without the song of gusles (a Montenegrin fiddle)!"

Austro-Hungarian influence can be seen all over Montenegro. Generally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire improved the Montenegrin infrastructure greatly as compared to the Ottoman Empire which is largely revered and documented by song and poem in how much sorrow it caused to the entire region. A lot of Montenegro's oldest and sturdiest roads were built by Austro-Hungarian engineers, such as this one by the secret crush of Milena, which has been preserved almost entirely in its original form.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Concrete Cows in Milton Keynes, England, are an iconic work of sculpture, created in 1978 by the American artist Liz Leyh. There are three cows and three calves, approximately half the size of their living counterparts.

Over the years they have been known to travel. One taking a journey and popping up across the U.K. Some were briefly moved when the new shopping was built and there were given pride of place in the middle.

Icons of the new city, there are actually two sets of Concrete Cows. The cows that call Bancroft Park home are the replica second set created by Bill Billings due to the original set, created by artist Liz Leyh with the community for the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, being quite delicate. The original herd can be found in their new home at Milton Keynes Museum in Wolverton.

Like the Triceratops created by Bill Billings at Peartree Bridge, the Concrete Cows were created from concrete and chicken wire.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This quaint shopping arcade is the oldest in the city of Rosario, housing very curious, charming little stores like a luthier workshop and even the local Esperanto Association.

In 1890, Andres Pan, a prosperous Spanish immigrant built this place to rent stores. Legend has it that his ghost still haunts the corridors at night, waiting to receive his tenants’ money.

Today Pasaje Pan houses a wide range of interesting stores selling jewelry, artworks, and vintage second-hand books. Many artists have their ateliers in the different offices on the second floor. In the basement, there is an art gallery with regular exhibits and performances.

So, if you want to buy an artistic souvenir or learn to speak a bit of Esperanto, Pasaje Pan is your ideal place. You will not be disappointed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Iowa's Maquoketa Caves State Park is home to enormous bluffs and a six-mile trail system that winds through geologic formations and dense woodlands. The park was officially established in 1921, but it has been drawing human visitors for hundreds, possibly thousands of years. Artifacts discovered in the caves include pottery, tools, and stone projectile points.

About 13 caves can be found in the park, including the 1,100-foot “Dancehall Cave” and many others such as Hernado’s Hideaway, Shinbone Cave, and Wye Cave. Some of these stone caverns can be explored by walking, while others are better suited for serious spelunkers who are comfortable in tight spaces.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Monterrey, climb the Cerro del Mirador mountain, and find the Church of Schönstatt amongst the hilltops. Leave comfort behind, depart on a physical journey, and find peace away from the big city. There are many of these little chapels located worldwide. However, the Schönstatt Catholic movement originated in Germany. 

The chapel sits sensitively in the beautiful and quiet landscape. The scenery is idyllic, the brisk winds are reassuring, and the valley beyond creates an atmosphere of tranquillity. Despite the chapel’s unassuming size, it certainly has a way of drawing visitors in closer. When you first catch a glimpse of the structure, the stained glass windows glisten in the sun like gemstones, and the crowning bell perched atop the pitched roof adds a quiet touch of dignity. 

It’s almost as if this humble yet charming little church takes on a personality of its own, beckoning visitors closer, whispering, “Look at me, look at me.”

Inside the chapel, sheltered from the elements, the structure cocoons you. The walls are washed with sunlight entering thru the windows, creating a symphony of color. Along the central aisle, the rows of pews at either side lead you toward the altar. There, directly ahead of you, an image of the Virgin Mary is enshrined, beautifully constructed in an ornate dark wood, aka el Santuario de Schönstatt. The daylight streams down upon the shrine of Mary and intensifies the atmosphere of peace and stillness.

Mary’s Road to Heaven, aka María, Camino al Cielo, is a pilgrimage dedicated to the Virgin Mary that is open to everyone. It’s a journey that leaves the everyday behind. An upward climb of 1,200 feet. A trail of discovery in the quiet of the mountains. And a pathway to peace away from the bustling city.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scattered in and around the 47 square miles that make up the city of San Francisco are 220 parks. They vary in size, from the sprawling green space that is Golden Gate Park to the minuscule one that is Mary Ellen Pleasant Memorial Park. Which basically covers the ground that consists of six eucalyptus trees and a plaque.

Mary Ellen Pleasant was born into slavery sometime at the beginning of the 1900s and escaped persecution when she arrived in California in 1852. She amassed a great fortune through her popular businesses, which included; dairies, laundries, and high-class restaurants. She had a penchant for being very savvy and forthright with her finances. So much so that she became one of America's first Black female millionaires, along with Madam C.J. Walker.

In addition to hiring formerly enslaved people to work in her many enterprises, Pleasant also donated large sums of money to support the Underground Railroad. This was a vast network of people who would offer aid and shelter to enslaved people. She also campaigned for the end of slavery in the state of California and fought to desegregate the city's street cars.

The city of San Francisco designated the six trees Pleasant planted herself, along with the plaque, as a Structure of Merit in 1974. The area of Octavia and Bush Streets is in the vicinity of where the "Mother of Civil Rights in California" once owned a mansion. It's common for ghost tours to start at the small park, where some say that Pleasant's spirit remains among the trees.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of Germany's oldest churches, Bonn Minster was built between the 11th and 13th centuries. It was the collegiate church of Saints Cassius and Florentius, third-century Roman legionaries of the legendary all-Christian Theban Legion.

According to the legend, the Legion's garrison was ordered by Roman Emperor Maxentius Herculius to march to Gaul. While on their way, the Emperor either ordered the Legion to massacre fellow Christians or worship him as a god. The soldiers refused, resulting in their martyrdom. Cassius and Florentius were beheaded on the site where Bonn Minster stands today.

In 2002, German-Turkish sculptor Iskender Yediler created a pair of giant granite sculptures, replicating the heads of the two saints portrayed at the church. They have been placed in front of Bonn Minster, lying mid-roll in a somewhat surreal manner.

Inside the church, a pair of 18th-century hardwood busts depicting Cassius and Florentius were discovered in its storehouse in 2006. Restored, they are put on display during the festive times in October above the entrance to the crypt.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upon entering the garden, a short walking loop leads through statuesque gardens. Like the rest of the garden, the succulent rockery is divided into geographic ecozones where Joshua trees, cacti, and Aloes dominate the Americas, and prickly turgid Europhobia in the African section. The plants come in many looming shapes and sizes, some old and slow-growing looming over eight feet high.

The tall buildings of the CBD can be seen above the eastern entrance to the garden while the garden is boarded on one side by the NSW State Herbarium. 

Like the grounds of the wider botanic gardens, the succulent rockery has a layered colonial history. Before the modern planting, the site held Australia’s first zoo which operated from 1862-1883. The zoo was started by the NSW acclimatization society, an organization whose objective was to introduce exotic flora and fauna to Australia. Its first residents included an anteater and Chinese deer. In 1883, the zoo was relocated to Moore Park south of the gardens.

In 1936, the first iteration of the cacti and succulent rockery was built and a larger garden was completed in 1983. The rockery also features a rustic sculpture garden by Jamie Durie which was added in 2007.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lake Macdonnell is the name given to this impressive body of water which sits around nine miles (15 kilometers) to the south of the South Australian town of Penong. Situated on the Eyre Peninsula, the lake sits on the Nullarbor Plain, a large arid desert that is one of the country's most unique landscapes. Visitors to Lake Macdonnell have to drive along a dirt track before being rewarded with magnificent views of the water.

When the conditions are right, the lake appears salmon pink in color and the high salt concentration gives a unique reflection effect. This special coloring is caused by dunaliella salina, an algae species that thrives in hypersaline conditions, and halobacteria that secrete a red pigment called carotenoid.

The lake also has an interesting industrial history and for many years was a booming salt mine. Gypsum, a soft sulfate mineral, has also been mined at the site since 1919, and this location is Australia's largest mine of this type and is thought to be one of the largest gypsum deposits in the southern hemisphere.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few airlines capture the romance of air travel's golden age more than Pan American World Airways, commonly known as Pan Am. Founded by Juan T. Trippe in 1927 and originally connecting the U.S. with Latin America, Pan Am grew to serve a worldwide network of destinations, first with large flying boats and later with jets.

In the late 1960s, Pan Am worked closely with Boeing on the design of the 747, the original Jumbo Jet and one of the world's most recognizable aircraft. but after Trippe's retirement in 1968, Pan Am began to fall on hard times. The oil crisis of the 1970s lowered demand for travel, and airline deregulation brought increased competition. Pan Am sold off most of its assets before finally declaring bankruptcy and ceasing operations in December 1991. 

While Pan Am airplanes no longer crisscross the skies, its iconic brand and legacy live on. Movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Catch Me If You Can prominently feature the airline. The airline also lives on in subtler ways: the reason why the pilot in command of an airliner is referred to as "captain," for example, traces its roots to Pan Am and its magnificent flying boats. 

The third floor of the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, Long Island, is known as Pan Am Museum, operated by the Pan Am Museum Foundation. It tells the story of the airline's 64-year history with original artifacts and scale models, as well as artwork. Those who never got the chance to fly aboard a Pan Am Clipper can be transported back in time to the heart of the jet age at the Pan Am Museum.]]></summary>

Her PhD research involved making real, practical, scalable, reproducible tools for the (late-in-pipeline) analysis of high-energy physics data from the . She built tools to speed up likelihood-free inferences, and she built a tool to find exclusion regions (upper limits) in complex parameter spaces. She used the latter to put constraints on a (real, not toy) proposed modification to the standard model.Large Hadron Collider
On the first project, the tools that she built (and built on) make the LHC more sensitive to new physics, because they find better test statistics for distinguishing models. They make some searches  better, which makes me wonder whether particle physics is using our money efficiently??far]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Nullarbor Roadhouse is one of the few resting places on the Nullarbor Plain, known for its vast, arid landscape in the region.

Originally operating as a remote outback station, the Nullarbor Station covered acres of land with paddocks of horses, sheep, and cattle grazing. As the infrastructure of Australia grew, a decision was made by the station manager in 1956 to begin selling petroleum to the hardy passersby who navigated the arduous gravel roads at that time. 

A small shop soon was then built, selling snacks and drinks and the Nullarbor Roadhouse then became a much-needed rest stop. In 1976, the Eyre Highway was completed and this allowed much easier access for those making the journey across the Nullarbor Plain.

At this time, a new roadhouse building was built and the same building has been restored with original artifacts to allow visitors to take a step back in time. The old building contains historic signs, original food and drink packaging, and an old petroleum pump, all of which have shown significant decay due to the extreme weather conditions here.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/wat-yannawa-boat-temple"/>
        <updated>2023-05-30T15:30:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally named Wat Kok Khwai, the Buddhist temple now known as Wat Yannawa or the “Boat Temple” was built during the Ayutthaya era, before the founding of Bangkok. It was merely a local place of worship until King Rama I granted it royal status and made the ordination hall known as subosot in Thai.

During the reign of Rama III (1824-1851), a defining feature was added to the temple complex: a viharn (monastery) in the shape of a Chinese junk. At the time, the junk ship was becoming obsolete and starting to be replaced by newer, more modern vessels. It is believed that King Rama III wished to preserve the image of the Chinese junk in the mind of his people.

Thanks to this unique feature, it was not long before the locals started to coin its nickname, Wat Yannawa (literally “boat temple”), which would stick and become its official name. With the two chedis designed to resemble masts, it also gained the nickname Sampao Chedi, the “Chinese junk with chedis,” as it looked more like a ship than a temple.

Today, besides the junk-shaped viharn, the temple complex contains multiple buildings enshrining images and a relic of the Buddha, effigies of Kuan Im, the goddess of mercy, and large paintings of the Loy Krathong lantern festival. In front of the “boat” stands a bronze statue of Rama III, looking proud that his image of the Chinese junk has lived on beyond his life.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Beneath the streets of Windsor lies a time capsule, buried in 2011 and sealed for 50 years. Its contents encapsulate through images, information, and videos, what the town of Windsor was like in 2011. However, it's not the capsule that captures the attention of passersby.

Fixed within the pavement is a working clock, ticking away under the feet of pedestrians. It was installed alongside the time capsule below, it sits within the same space as a previous pavement clock, originally installed in 1950. Sir Cyril Dyson, jeweler and clockmaker for the queen, sunk the clock into the pavement outside his shop as a showcase of his skills. The original clock went missing in the 1980s following the closure of Dyson’s store.

The pavement clock of Windsor is thought to be one of a kind in Britain, and those brave enough to level their ear to the timepiece have reported the distinct tick-tock of its mechanism emanating from below.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An hour and a half south of Washington, D.C. lies a small air museum with a remarkable collection, including one-of-a-kind airplanes.

Sidney Shannon Jr. was a businessman and pilot whose father was one of the founders of Eastern Air Lines. In 1950, Shannon founded Shannon Airport, an airport for general aviation (small, private planes) just outside of Fredericksburg, Virginia.

An air museum on the property was opened in 1976. From its beginning, the museum has housed a collection of rare aircraft from the "golden age of flight". Following Sidney Shannon's death in 1981, the future of the airport and museum was uncertain. For a while, the collection was moved to another museum in Richmond. In 2017, however, the museum was reopened and the collection returned to its original home.

Several of the aircraft on exhibit, including the Vultee V-1AD Special, are the only remaining example of their type. Other rare aircraft include a Pitcairn Mailwing PA-5 and a Bellanca CH-400 Skyrocket.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Visiting St. Peter Stiftskulinarium is a spiritual and gastronomic pilgrimage.  Located within the expansive confines of Salzburg's St. Peter's Abbey, a 7th-century Benedictine monastery, its existence was first chronicled by Alcuin of York, a scholar and trusted advisor to Charlemagne.

Wandering these hallowed halls, one can’t help but imagine Mephistopheles talking shop with Faust, or Christopher Columbus raising a glass of Salzburg Stiegl beer before his historic voyage. While legends persist, the establishment’s age is undeniable. St. Peter Stiftskulinarium, mentioned in documents dating back to 803, claims to be the oldest known operating restaurant in Europe.

The restaurant’s grandeur extends across 11 dining rooms, each with its own elaborate design and tapestry of captivating anecdotes. From the opulent Baroque Hall to the intimate “citizens’ room” Prälatenstube, the establishment is certainly a feast for the eyes. With an 850-person capacity, it also offers ample opportunity for people-watching.

The Stiftskulinarium’s kitchen prides itself on serving upscale regional specialties, including the Viennese classic tafelspitz (slow-simmered beef in broth and vegetables) and Salzburger Nockerl a sweet dessert soufflé made with egg yolk, flour, sugar and vanilla. With changing seasons, the menu embraces diverse local flavors, showcasing fresh fish, game dishes, and often imaginative influences from Mediterranean cuisine.

As twilight descends, the restaurant’s renowned Mozart Dinner Concert takes place. Every night, the Baroque Hall’s high stuccoed ceilings are illuminated by candlelight across white gala tables. In collaboration with the Salzburg Concert Society, the dining experience features a three-course menu of authentic 17th- and 18th-century recipes accompanied by live musical performances featuring the work of Salzsburg’s most famous native, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Performers and stewards in fanciful period attire add to the time-warp flair.]]></summary>

In a rural town along the San Juan River in southeastern Utah, an esteemed botanist and local innkeeper got to talking in the summer of 1937. Together, the pair hatched a plan—to run the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. A journey like theirs had never before been attempted. The University of Michigan botanist, Elzada Clover, intended to make the first-ever botanical survey of the river and its environs. The innkeeper, Norman Nevills, wanted to commercialize trips down the Colorado River (despite never having run the river himself). The next summer Clover and Nevills, along with two other boatmen, a photographer, and botanist Lois Jotter, Elzada’s close…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ningaloo George, also known as the "Big Whale Shark" is an impressive fiberglass sculpture found on the grounds of a petrol station in the remote Australian town of Exmouth.

The art was designed and constructed by local artist Brian Paskins and was unveiled to the public on January 31, 2002. The town sits on the tip of the North West Cape of Australia and is well known for the marine life found here, making it a popular spot for tourists snorkeling and diving on the Ningaloo Reef.  

Whale sharks are one of many species that can be found off the coast of Exmouth and this sculpture pays tribute to their migration to the reef between the months of March to June. They are the largest species of sharks and visit the Ningaloo Reef due to the mass spawning of coral which brings abundant feeding opportunities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many universities across the world have their own museums dedicated to a variety of subjects and collections. Regis College in Weston, Massachusettes has one located on the southern edge of its campus. However, this location is quite distinctive as it's one of the few museums in the United States dedicated to the study and collecting of postage stamps, also known as Philately.

Founded in 1961, the Spellman Museum of Stamps & Postal History, or the Cardinal Spellman Philatelic Museum is the oldest museum of its kind in the United States. It is also the second largest collection of philatelic material after the National Postal Museum operated by the Smithsonian. Its founder was Cardinal Francis Spellman, who served as the sixth Archbishop of New York from 1939 to 1967 and previously as the auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston from 1932 to 1939. He was also an avid philatelic.

Today, the museum contains over two million items including Spellman's personal collection, pieces from the former National Philatelic Museum in Philadelphia as well as donations from the general public.

Its principal mission is to preserve and promote knowledge of history, geography, art, culture, architecture, science, and nature through the story of stamps and postage.]]></summary>

The main building of the museum is home to a very comprehensive display of knives, the history of cutlery, and its tradition in Thiers. The second building is a forge where museum employees showcase knife-making techniques. 

From its installation in artisanal form until the start of its industrialization, the museum traces the social and economic history of cutlery in Thiers. It pays tribute to the workers who have developed their skills under highly challenging working conditions. The development of the jurande, a trade body an oath was created to observe the regulations of their trade, but also a commitment of solidarity.]]></summary>

It's good practice, I think, because you can't understand anything if you don't write about it.]]></summary>

The architect Dal Nagle designed and built it in 1968 for Sam Bell, owner of Bell Brand Snack Foods. He wanted a futuristic-looking house that could withstand naturally occurring rock slides, earthquakes, and waves.

The original name was the Bell Pavillion, and you could access it from the cliffs via a nearly vertical tramway that ran almost 300 feet down the cliff. It was also used as a guest house, offering a 180-degree view from Torrey Pines State Park to La Jolla.

The house is currently abandoned, and its cliffside tram hasn't run in years. Though it sits in a state of disrepair along the San Diego beach, the sturdy concrete structure remains intact.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know the feeling. The door opens onto a white expanse. The light is overwhelming; you can feel it in your head and instinctively raise a hand to cover your eyes. Then the white fades out to the edges. You might see green on the trees, or the blue of water, or the gray of a motel parking lot. It’s summer. There’s a breeze. And you have a whole day and night ahead of you.

This is how we at Atlas Obscura think of the beginning of summer—blinding, then full of opportunity and the potential for adventure. To celebrate that feeling and the potential it carries, this year we’re presenting our first-ever season-long special section: Summer of Wonder.

For the next three months, we’re going to be exploring three themes that capture some of the magic of being outside in the summertime:


On the Road: Road tripping and roadside attractions, modern and historical

Summer Nights: Starry skies, fireflies, and nostalgia

Go Wild: Encounters with the natural world (with a preview of one of Atlas Obscura’s big new projects)


Summer of Wonder will include stories that explore overlooked corners of history, food, and the natural world, as well as recommendations that can help you make the most of your escapades—from itineraries and roadside geology, to stargazing and recognizing some of the creatures you might meet (or dream of) along the way.

Charge your battery or fill up your tank. We’ve got miles ahead of us.]]></summary>

It was a place to sneak away to with friends in spring to play in the flowers until the early 2000s. The property is now called Parson Reserve and is a part of the DNRT Trust. The first daffodils were planted on the property during World War II and now there are thousands of them throughout the woods.

The trails are open year-round but the best time to see the flowers is in the spring (April). The daffodil field is up a steep wooded trail and hidden from view of the road. The trails DNRT keeps up the trails and they are lightly marked so it's easy to find the way. People aren't allowed to walk or pick the flowers anymore, but there are narrow walking paths through them.]]></summary>

So they made it their mission to seek out what lay beyond these limited search results. And what they found was a world brimming with everything from Pakistani hot chicken and Uzbek dumplings to Turkish flatbreads and roast brisket on rye.

“There's this multiculturalism of different kinds of restaurants and people just wanting to try other people's food,” says Azad, one-third of the team of food bloggers known collectively as Muslim Foodies. Since 2017, Azad, Choudhry, and Baksh have reviewed around 370 New York area halal restaurants for their blog and gained an international…]]></summary>

This wasn't just any juice stand. It was Gibeau Orange Julep, a towering dome run by a family that’s slung their orange juleps—a creamier take on squeezed citrus, thanks to the addition of powdered egg—since the 1930s.

"Most people spend, like, a year planning that," he laughs. "I just go."
This is a typical weekend for Pujol, who spends his free time traveling the country and chronicling the history of roadside Americana ("well, Canadiana" in the case of the giant orange, he points out) for his online alter-ego, The Retrologist. Armed wit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The coast-to-coast road trip, that American essential, turns 120 this year. In 1903, Horatio Jackson and Sewall Crocker became the first people ever to drive a car from one side of the United States all the way to the other.

Cars were an exciting novelty at the time, and their numbers were exploding—from 8,000 in 1900 to 32,920 in 1903—but many still considered the “horseless carriage” a passing fad. There were few suitable roads, let alone a nationwide road network. So theirs was an adventure like none before. And it all started with a $50 bet.

This map is from the 1907 edition of the Automobile Association of America’s Blue Book. It shows the routes of all the cross-country car trips completed until then: no more than 11 in total—and strangely, all duos. (The Jackson-Crocker trip is …]]></summary>

In the coastal town of Ocean City, crowds of out-of-towners descend upon the 2.5-mile long boardwalk, tying up coveted parking spaces and congregating outside beloved establishments like Johnson’s Caramel Popcorn and Manco & Manco Pizza. Others stake their spots along OC’s narrow beaches, pitching enormous umbrellas and spreading out their chairs and blankets. There’s no question about it: the season of “shoobies'' has begun.

At first, the bodies are easy to overlook. But as summer progresses on Tuckernuck Island off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, more and more victims turn up. Their mangled corpses litter the roads and driveways. Despite their headless state, these victims are easy to identify. They are Narceus americanus, the American giant millipede. And no one knows what is killing them.

For decades, scientists have tried to find the answer to the question of why the headless millipedes turn up by the hundreds every summer on Tuckernuck. This phenomenon, on this scale, happens nowhere else on Earth. Identifying the culprit has implications beyond this small, sandy island: whatever animal is ultimately responsible, the answer may reveal a bran…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were discussions this week at University of Warwick about the Terra Hunting Experiment strategy and likely detection capability. Various take-homes include that we need to mitigate lots of stellar noise, and that we care deeply about the covariance (as a function of separation in time) of adjacent measurements. I advocated that we split our ten-year survey into two or three surveys, of varying length. In the first, we learn about the stars, and in the last, we go to town on the very most promising targets. There was general agreement that this is a good idea. But now we need a very specific plan for what this means. As my loyal reader knows, in my view, the decisions must be based on repeatable operations, so that we have some hope of learning statistical things about populations in the end.]]></summary>

My mind was blown by Ben Lakeland (Exeter), who showed  data of the Sun, and then showed that, from these images, he can predict the magnetic-activity-generated RV signals in simultaneous EPRV measurements of the Solar RV. That's pretty exciting. He also showed that much of the time, the RV variations are dominated not by magnetic activity . If we are going to beat one meter per second, we are going to have to correct for convective shifts. Somehow!?Terra HuntingSolar Dynamics Orbiterper se]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like the graphical lay out of Jordan-Holder. I've drawn pictures like this, but I hadn't worked out the axiomatization of all possible pictures, which is really clarifying. It's also good preparation for Schubert calculus: If you consider the case where your ground ring is a field, this is the recipe to assign a permutation to a pair of complete flags.

Could I make a notational suggestion? You call your modules M_i, M'_j and M_{i,j}. If you called them X_i, Y_j and Z_{i,j}, not only would they be more visually distinctive, but you could make it mnemonic -- X_i on the x-axis and Y_j on the y-axis. This would be particularly nice because you use the variables i, i', j and j' later, and it surprised me that i and i' went with M while j and j' go with M'.]]></summary>
