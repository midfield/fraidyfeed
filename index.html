                              <span>Driving down a gravel road in rural Missouri, the last thing you would expect to see are several pair of shoes dangling above your windshield, but this is exactly what you will encounter while driving down this rural Perry County road. 

The tree is just on the north side of the roadside ditch on County Road 324.  The origins stem from a trip taken in the early 2000s by the landowners to the state of Nevada where they encountered a similar tree with many pair of shoes dangling from the branches.

The man chose a tree close to the road on his property and flung a pair of shoes in it. At family gatherings, he encouraged his descendants to do the same. Now it has become a point of curiosity.

There are so many shoes in the tree it would be difficult to count. Some people make a wish before throwing their shoes, others write messages on their shoes like &quot;self-doubt,&quot; &quot;weight troubles,&quot; or a bible verse. The various types of shoes in the tree show a variety of footwear worn by the throwers. There are football cleats, running shoes, work boots, and basically anything that can catch itself on a branch in the tree.  Then there is the act of throwing, which is the best for getting the shoes attached without spending all day throwing them up in the air only to see them fall back down.</span>

                              <span>For at least a decade, a giant Buddha statue has watched over a stretch of U.S. 101 in Redwood City, California. The statue is not part of a temple complex or a garden. Instead, it is perched on top of a concrete shelter filled with dumpsters, in an office parking lot.

Its origins are a mystery, but it must have been quite the feat to transport and situate the massive statue on top of the concrete shelter. It faces away from the parking lot and gazes out over the freeway.

Despite the unusual location, the statue has become a site of worship. Visitors leave gifts along the statue&#x27;s base, ranging from bottles of water to sticks of incense. Most drivers rushing through their commutes below likely have no idea that the watchful Buddha is sitting in such a humble spot.</span>

                              <span>Our Lady of Ljeviš is a medieval Serbian Orthodox church located in Prizren. The building is not only a place of worship but a symbol of national and cultural identity for the Serbian Orthodox community. Its inclusion as a UNESCO World Heritage site recognizes its importance as a testament to the region&#x27;s medieval heritage and artistic legacy.

The church was constructed at the beginning of the 14th century, during the Serbian medieval period, and is renowned for its Byzantine-influenced architecture. It showcases a unique blend of architectural styles, combining elements of Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic traditions. Having been built during the reign of the King of Serbia, Stefan Milutin, on the site of a former Byzantine church, it features frescoes by Byzantine Greek painters Michae…</span>

                              <span>Walking through the bustling Cape Town waterfront, you will see many old and new buildings, many of which have a maritime history. Perhaps one of the most important of these buildings is a tiny unsuspecting tower with a large ball on top of it. 

This tower, aptly called the Time Ball Tower, is an 1894 time device similar to the one in the Greenwich Observatory in the United Kingdom, which was used to give a visual signal of the time to ships in the bay, as this was much more accurate than an auditory signal like those of the noon gun, simply because sound travels much slower than light. This was a vital task, as a ship&#x27;s clock (or chronometer) was needed for navigation, and any drifts could blow a ship off course or worse.  

The tower was initially built on the former Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, but an 1860s expansion of the harbor obscured the old tower, which created the need for a new one. Initially this was a wooden tower, which was later replaced by the current model in 1894, which remained in use for another 40 years. 

Since then the need for time balls dwindled, and so did their maintenance. The tower was used for a while as a signal repeater for the area, until it was declared a monument and restored in 1997. Since then the time ball has been operational again, and used on occasion.</span>

                              <span>An institution in the urban landscape of the center of Madrid, the San Ginés Book Shop is still going strong. This open-air bookstore is steeped in history.

A stone&#x27;s throw from one of the most famous places in Madrid for churros with chocolate is this picturesque bookstore. The San Ginés Book Shop is actually one of the oldest bookshops in Spain. It is situated in the scenic Pasadizo de San Ginés, between Calle Arenal and Calle Mayor, near the parish of the same name and Chocolatería de San Ginés

Its beginnings can be traced to the 17th century when Diego Logroño, the first known bookseller, started his business in 1650.

Old and used books are the store&#x27;s expertise. Unique and exceptional copies are blended with city guides and political references on the tables set up at a street level, which—combined with the fantastic opportunities at reasonable prices—make this book sanctuary a haven for both collectors and curious shoppers.</span>

In 2018, news spread around Saroj Duru’s village that four elephants had gathered at a nearby lake. Such creatures didn’t typically visit her region in central India—they were known to stay further north in more forested habitats—and so, out of curiosity, Duru and her neighbors walked down to see them.

The elephants rested in the water as people jostled at the shore, trying to get a closer look. Others climbed trees for a better view. After an hour of savoring the thrill of seeing such large animals, Duru headed back home. She was not sure when she would see them again.

Instead, that same day, a herd rampaged through the village’s farms. “They tore our boundary wall and tore up…</span>

                              <span>Just outside Belfast on the N4 highway sits this piercing war memorial. The monument was built in 1970 as a replacement for the original, much smaller, monument that was placed in 1930.

This piercing, brutalist piece commemorates the Battle of Bergendal which took place in  August 1900. Thousands of British and Boer forces battled in what was the last set-piece battle of the Second Boer War. The battle resulted in the retreat of the Boer forces, more than 400 casualties, and Lord Roberts declaring the entire South African Republic as British territory. 

The site is difficult to miss when passing from either direction on the N4. An additional monument sitting behind the main one also commemorates the lives of the British forces that were lost. There is some signage giving background on the events of the battle, but due to sun damage, it&#x27;s difficult to read. The names of the lives lost on both sides remain forged on granite plaques around the memorial.</span>

                              <span>Cine Doré, inaugurated in 1912, is a modernist building that holds 1,250 spectators. The building underwent its first of many renovations in 1923 by architect Críspulo Moro Cabeza.

The building lost part of its original glamor during the late 1930s and became a rather unattractive place, and for some time it was even known as the Sunflower Palace. 

The façade is in a modernist style with six Ionic columns and a medallion surrounded by flowers. The Municipal Corporation acquired the cinema in 1982 and the Ministry of Culture used it as a stable location for projections for the Spanish Film Library.

The restoration by architect Javier Feduchi began in 1982 and ended in 1989, with the cinema inaugurated on February 28 of the same year. There are two theories about the origins of the name, one attributing it to a tribute to Gustave Doré and the other to the first two musical notes.

Its most recent restoration was led by the architect Javier Feduchi, who preserved the decorative and architectural elements of the old building adding a second room at the bottom.

Since 1989, the Doré Cinema has served as the Spanish Film Library&#x27;s projection space. It is used for both its programming and a variety of outreach initiatives that promote Spanish cinematography and cinema in general.</span>

                              <span>Not a lot of historic landmarks in Vientiane remain in their original forms, having been numerous wars and invasions—particularly the Siamese onslaught of 1827 and the Indochina Wars that lasted for 55 years. A few exceptions are Wat Si Saket, a Buddhist temple built in 1818, and That Dam, an ancient stupa steeped in legend.

Standing in the center of a roundabout near the Talat Sao morning market, the stupa is believed to be around 500 years old, though the exact date of construction remains uncertain. The name That Dam (not that dam) means “black tower” in Lao, based on its current status. However, it was not always darkened and overrun with weeds; local legends claim that it was once gilded over and that the gold was all stripped away by the Siamese invaders.

Generally, stupas are built to enshrine Buddhist relics, most often the ashes of monks and nuns, sometimes of kings. In the case of That Dam, it is unknown what is buried inside, but locals whisper of an intriguing legend. According to them, lying dormant underneath the stupa is the Naga, a seven-headed serpent that will awaken whenever Vientiane faces a crisis. Many of them believe that it has protected the city from the 1827 invasion, as well as on other historical occasions.

The stupa has fallen into disrepair since the Naga last showed itself, weather-worn and all but neglected, but there are still believers in the powerful serpent. In fact, some locals seem to continue to visit the ancient monument to dedicate flowers to the forgotten guardian of Vientiane, in hopes that its peaceful slumber will never again be disturbed.</span>

In this museum, there are no dry historical descriptions to be found—all the stories are told by the former children themselves. The exhibit contains 50 personal items belonging to locals who were children during the Siege of Sarajevo, ranging from toys to school books to emergency ration kits. Each object is connected to a story or memory from the war, which is told by its owner over a personal audioguide.

The War Childhood Museum is an intimate and emotional look at how children of various ages experience growing up in a warzone. Aside from the permanent exhibition in Sarajevo, the museum also engages in research and advocacy work, including projects with children in Syria and Ukraine.</span>

Hm, I can&#x27;t figure out what it should be either.  I also found it on the web, and kept a copy in case it disappears.  I tried to contact the author via a webform, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve removed the link from the bibliography, but really wish there could be a canonical source.  If I could contact the author, I&#x27;d recommend that he post it on the arXiv, where it could be preserved for posterity.</span>

No, that makes sense!   You&#x27;re right; I&#x27;ve removed the &quot;set brackets&quot; and hope that what I mean will be clear.  If you think another wording is better, please feel free to suggest something.</span>

                              <span>The world of elementary particles has something in common with our own: there are large inequalities in the properties of particles, as in the properties of human beings. The heaviest particle, the top quark, with its estimated mass of 172 GeV is five orders of magnitude heavier than the most common matter constituents, the up and down quarks and the electron. Along with the top quark there are three other heavyweight particles that we currently call elementary -perhaps only a label we have to use because we haven&#x27;t been able to split them further into smaller bits: the Higgs boson (125 GeV), the Z boson (91 GeV), and the W boson (80 GeV).

                              <span>The goal of this post is to present a simple formula for fairly pricing options, called the binomial options pricing model (Cox et al., 1979; Rendleman, 1979). This is sometimes called the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model (CRR) after the authors’ surnames in (Cox et al., 1979). I like this model because it is a simple, discrete-time model that captures much of the intuition behind how to price options, while avoiding much of the mathematical machinery needed for a continuous-time treatment or Black–Scholes (Black &amp; Scholes, 1973). Learning the binomial model is like climbing a smaller, easier mountain that gives views that are almost as good as its larger, more intimidating neighbor. As we will see, despite its simplicity this model introduces many important concepts from the options-pricing literature such as the no-arbitrage condition, pricing via replication, and the risk-neutral measure. And it does so without any advanced mathematics.</span>

                              <span>Between Nashville’s iconic Music Row and Vanderbilt University, Sarabha&#x27;s Creamery, the city&#x27;s first homemade Indian-style ice cream shop, quietly works sweet, frozen magic from the second story of a nondescript strip mall. It’s the passion project of husband-and-wife duo Gursharan Singh and Manpreet Gill, who opened the parlor in 2022 after leaving jobs in tech. As Gill explained in an interview with Nashville Scene, the pair saw the empty storefront and decided to make the switch almost immediately. 

The mango kulfi—reminiscent of a tropical creamsicle—is the perfect starter to a multi-course ice cream feast, and comes in flavors like malai (with cardamom and milk solids) and kesar pista (saffron with pistachios). It melts quickly, so it’s both logistically sound and extremely satisfying to lick it off the stick as quickly as possible. 

The rest of the ice creams are equally stellar. Sarabhas’s incorporates less air into its Indian-style ice cream than a typical American scoop, giving it a texture more akin to gelato. Pair flavors such as rose tutti frutti, cardamom-scented Indian coffee, and paan nawabi (made with rose petals and cashews) in a crispy waffle cone or bowl, then wash it all down with a steaming masala chai.

Visually, the star of the show is Sarabhas&#x27; vibrant falooda, which arrives brimming with malai ice cream, sweet basil seeds, vermicelli noodles, and jellied fruit bobbing a cup of ice-cold milk, all finished with a cherry and a swirl of fuchsia rose syrup. Originally invented in Persia more than 2,500 years ago, faloodeh is a dessert made from frozen vermicelli soaked in a rose syrup. Persians began arriving in India during the 8th century, so faloodeh had plenty of time to catch on, attain royal status, and then morph into a popular milkshake-like dessert, all while retaining almost exactly the same name—falooda.</span>

                              <span>First housed inside an old mule-pulled trolley car, Brown’s Diner has changed hands three times since 1927 without losing its charm or its original ethos. Customers now have the option to dine on a covered patio area next to the old trolley, but the interior of the diner remains a time warp. 

The concise menu sticks to the classics—Frito chili pies, wings, fried chicken plates—and does them well. But the cheeseburger, Brown&#x27;s claim to fame, is what an old-school fast food burger aspires to be: a slender patty with a hint of char on the outside and a pink interior, blanketed in American cheese and Duke’s mayo. It costs less than $10, tastes like a million bucks, and can (and should) be ordered alongside a basket of ultra-crispy Tater Tots.

The diner also bears the unusual distinction of having Nashville’s oldest beer license. Throughout its lifetime, generations of recording artists—from John Prine to Vince Gill—have played on its small stage and knocked back a cold one at the bar.</span>

                              <span>During the final years of World War II, the Nazis forced thousands of prisoners to carve out an elaborate system of tunnels under Silesia&#x27;s Owl Mountains. Almost all documentation related to the project was destroyed before the German surrender, meaning that the purpose and the true extent of these tunnels, codenamed Project &quot;Riese&quot; (or &quot;Giant&quot;), remain shrouded in mystery to this day.

The secret tunnels under Silesia have attracted numerous treasure hunters over the years, convinced that somewhere under this low mountain range lies a trove of Nazi loot. Theories about the true purpose of the Silesian tunnels range from a secret underground train system to transport stolen gold and other treasures, to the final hiding place of the Amber Room, to a covert weapons lab working on the &quot;Wunderwaffe,&quot; a top-secret new weapon under development by the Nazis.

Most historians now believe that the tunnels were probably an attempt to move key factories underground and away from Allied bombing raids, but this hasn&#x27;t stopped others from searching further. The full extent of the Nazi tunnel system under Silesia has yet to be uncovered, and the region continues to attract treasure hunters from all over the world, looking for new stores of Nazi gold.

The tunnels were abandoned after the war, and for several decades, only experienced cavers and treasure hunters dared to explore the many underground complexes dug out during Project Riese. Beginning in the 2000s, however, many known sections of the tunnels have been secured and opened to the public. The most famous of the Silesian tunnels are the ones under Ksiaz castle, but more than a dozen other self-contained tunnel systems have been discovered throughout the Owl Mountains, notably in the modern Polish towns of Osówka, Rzeczka/Walim, Soboń, Jawornik, and Włodarz.</span>

                              <span>Wedged into a strip mall parking lot behind a Subway, this unassuming pizza parlor turns out 18-inch New York–style pies that could make Manhattan’s top pizzaiolos weak in the knees. Offerings lean unconventional, with standouts including the Esmerelda, featuring pistachio pesto, fig preserves, and charred lamb flank, and the Bianca, which tops a ricotta base with locally grown oyster mushrooms. 

The real feat of nature, however, is the pickle pizza, which pairs slivers of kosher dill pickles with toasted garlic, ricotta cream, smoked provolone, and ranch. Recently, the kitchen crew has been experimenting with a plussed-up variation called the “Hot Matty.” Chef David Bonner, Jr., inspired by a cluster of daikon radish sprouts growing on the counter, whipped up a daikon-feta pesto and amp…</span>

                              <span>The biscuits arrive in an unassuming disposable box, still gently warm and roughly the size of a softball. Served with honey butter, jam, and tangy-sweet house-made curd, they’re already superb, but used as the vehicle for a breakfast sandwich, they’re transcendent. From the fried chicken and waffles to the shrimp and grits, there’s no dead weight on the short, sharp menu at Yay Yay’s, but if you only have stomach capacity for one item, a biscuit needs to be a part of it.  

Chef Charlotte Miller, who built up a reputation through catering for years, opened her first brick-and-mortar along with her business partner Jason Luntz in 2022. From its location on Jefferson Street, a historic commerce hub, to the wall murals, to the thoughtfully curated selection of books by Michael Twitty, Toni Tipton-Martin, and others, every facet of her café is a celebration of Black history and culture in Nashville. The airy, welcoming interior is ideal for a leisurely brunch or afternoon tea.

The “Can You Say Yay Yay?” with fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, and pimiento cheese on a biscuit is absolutely as much of a triple-threat as it sounds like. The whole concoction is structurally unsound in the right way, with a biscuit crumb so ethereal that it begins to disintegrate almost as soon as it hits your fingers. You won’t mind—the messy sense of immediacy of this sandwich is part of its allure.</span>

                              <span>Tinside Lido is a famous outdoor swimming pool complex located on the waterfront in Plymouth. It holds historical significance as a Grade II listed building, adorning the city&#x27;s edge to the English Channel. 

The lido was opened in 1935 having been designed by the architect John Wibberley. It features an iconic Art-Deco style, with sleek lines, curved edges, and a stunning white façade. The design was influenced by the &quot;ocean liner aesthetic&quot; renowned during that era, with many of the U.K.&#x27;s seaside towns building lidos in the 1930s as an ode to the rise of popularity in sport and fitness. What makes this lido a must-visit is its heritage and beautiful curves, telling of history in its peeling paint and quaint 30s signage.

Over the years, Tinside Lido has undergone periods of closure and renovation to maintain its historic charm and functionality. Like other lidos, it has had periods when it was abandoned and out of use. Fortunately, Plymouth&#x27;s Tinside Lido is one of the lucky lidos that has not been subject to demolition.

In 2003, the Tinside Lido underwent a major restoration, preserving its original features while incorporating modern facilities and amenities. Since then, it is functional in the summer months as a full-blown swimming pool that can be entered with a small fee.</span>

                              <span>In 1944, the Jewish people in Budapest, much like those before them in major cities across Europe, were forced to live in a small 20-block area of the 7th district. Many tourists today will learn about the plight of Hungary&#x27;s Jewish citizens through the history of the Dohány Street Synagogue (The Great Synagogue), the Holocaust Memorial, and the Hungarian Jewish Museum. There are also some more subtle remnants of the impact of the Nazi pogrom on the people of Budapest, if you know where to look.

One of the more hidden memorials isn&#x27;t entirely authentic, but its location is. The wall surrounding the Jewish ghetto was erected in November 1944 and destroyed in 2006. However, the 30-meter section that sits at the back of the courtyard at 15 Király Utca was reconstructed in 2010 (minus the original barbed wire) to serve as a permanent reminder of the tens of thousands who were forced to live in the area. You can find carefully placed stones and votive lamps along the wall in memory of the people who were interred there.

A small plaque on the street describes the memorial wall in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew. Getting to the wall itself requires entering the courtyard of the private apartments currently occupying the location. Pass through the courtyard and continue out through the short tunnel to a second courtyard to find the remains of the wall and a small plaque showing a map of the original ghetto.</span>

                              <span>After World War I, the 1919 Treaty of Versailles brought the Polish state back into existence after 123 years of division and occupation by the Prussian, Austrian, and Russian empires, formalizing the borders of this resurrected Poland by carving out territory from these three failing imperial powers.

Poland&#x27;s new border was moved even further west after World War II, but during the interwar period between 1919 and 1939, its border with Germany followed more or less the same course as the provincial delimitation between modern Poland&#x27;s Lubusz and Wielkopolska Voivodeships. This former international border is today overgrown with thick forests that conceal many old, fortified border crossings and bunkers which have become popular landmarks for local hikers.

Only one of the original border markers from the Versailles era has survived to the present day, and it stands in a public park in the Polish village of Wierzbno. It&#x27;s engraved with the date of the Versailles Treaty—June 28, 1919—as well as a &quot;P&quot; for Poland and a &quot;D&quot; for Deutschland (Germany). The actual border crossing was located about one kilometer further east along Poland&#x27;s national road 24 where the Lubusz Voivodeship meets the Wielkopolska Voivodeship, and is commemorated with a small monument, an information board, and some crumbling ruins of the customs buildings that used to stand there.</span>

                              <span>Situated within the Fremantle Cemetery lies the final resting place of Ronald Belford &quot;Bon&quot; Scott, lead vocalist of the popular rock band AC/DC.

Bon was born on July 9, 1946, in a town north of the Scottish city of Dundee. (You can find a bronze statue of the singer in Kirriemuir, where he spent the first few years of his life.) In 1952, at the age of six, he migrated to Australia with his family. They lived in Melbourne for a time before relocating to the Perth suburb of Fremantle.

In 1974, he was asked to join the band AC/DC by Malcolm and Angus Young, two brothers from Glasgow and over a period of six years, Scott reached world fame through his performances as the lead singer of the band. 

On February 19, 1980, Scott tragically passed away after leaving a nightclub and later falling asleep in his friend&#x27;s car, with the coroner determining the cause of death to be acute alcohol poisoning. Scott&#x27;s body was embalmed and his family decided to scatter his ashes at this site in Fremantle Cemetery. The memorial site includes a plaque and memorial bench and due to his contributions to the field of music, the National Trust of Australia has deemed this a site of cultural significance.</span>

                              <span>The history of Trutnov is intimately bound with dragons, as even the shortest term visitor will notice. Dragons adorn businesses throughout the city center and comprise some of the city&#x27;s most prominent statues. Depending on the time of year, you may even be lucky enough to see one hoisted from city hall.

According to local legend, in 1006, shortly after Trutnov was founded, two stonecutters stumbled upon a dragon&#x27;s den while searching the woods for building materials. They rushed back to town and informed a local knight, Lord Albrecht von Trautenberg. Although he was skeptical of their story, he went to investigate it for himself, bringing with him several men from the town armed with rope nooses to capture the beast. Using a lamb as bait, they lured the dragon from its lair and were able to subdue it before suffocating it to death with smoke. The dragon was then skinned, stuffed, and hung in the town square.

In thanks to Lord Albrecht, the new city was supposedly named in his honor (Trautenau), and was later adapted into Czech as &#x27;Trutnov&#x27;. Legend also has it that the stuffed dragon was gifted to Brno, and continues to hang in its city hall.

Every year in the first weekend of May, the residents of Trutnov commemorate the slaying of the dragon in a ceremony called Už ho nesou (&quot;They are already carrying him&quot;), in which a tin dragon is symbolically hoisted up onto the facade of the city hall in the main square, where it remains until September or October. The ceremony itself is accompanied by a large public festival with food, drinks, and medieval costumes. Outsiders are rare, but are more than welcome.</span>

                              <span>In the 1930s Pittston, Pennsylvania, was dubbed the &quot;Quality Tomato Capital of the World,&quot; because it fulfilled the high demand for tomatoes from metropolitan New York.

In 1984 the city began the now-yearly Pittston Tomato Festival. Held every August, it includes a tomato fight, a tomato pageant, a tomato parade, and other tomato-centered activities.

The tomato statue has become a sculptural salute to the fruit that the city adores. The city identifies as the “quality” tomato capital, not the “quantity” tomato capital.</span>

                              <span>In the 1950s, the site now known as Riker Hill Art Park was used as a United States Army Nike Missile Tracking Base. Its location, the highest elevation in the county, offered the perfect clear line defense against anyone attempting to target the New York Metro area.

By the 1970s, due to advancements in weapons systems, these measures became obsolete, and in 1974, the base, known as Riker Hill Nike Battery Control Area NY-80, was sold to the county for $1. For a short time, the site was used to showcase dinosaur fossils that had been found nearby, in a quarry. But there was little interest from the public, and this was also closed down.

Shortly after, the former army barracks were transformed into 38 artist studios, with the spaces now being used for various disciplines, such as sculpture, painting, photography, glass blowing, pottery, printmaking, ceramics, and more.

Each of the buildings is painted a different color. Whilst taking a stroll around the 42-acre complex you can enjoy the scenic overlooks, check out the large metal sculptures, and also see if you can spot any military remnants.</span>

As space photography confirms, the universe beyond the troposphere is harsh and unforgiving. Our mechanical telescopes and satellite cameras capture a cold, impersonal place. Starkly beautiful sometimes, but instantly lethal always—not somewhere you would want to go on a Sunday picnic.


How different is this mid-19th century display of Comets and Aerolites. It presents these heavenly bodies—“aerolite” is a now obsolete term for meteorite—in warm colors and animate shapes.

                              <span>The waters off the coast of southwestern England are notoriously treacherous. For centuries, sailors who attempted to navigate the currents found themselves dashed against the rugged coastline of Cornwall and entrapped by the submerged rocks that guard the Isles of Scilly; some 1,000 vessels are believed to lie beneath the waves around the islands today. Thanks to one family—five generations of the Gibsons of Scilly—there is a photographic record of hundreds of these dramatic shipwrecks and the heroic efforts undertaken by locals to save the crews and retrieve their cargo.

“Within the photographs, you have stories of rescue and salvage and plunder,” says Jeremy Michell, a curator at the National Maritime Museum in London. A decade ago, the museum acquired about 1,800 images from the fami…</span>

                              <span>My only  work time today came at the end of the day, working with Emily Griffith (Colorado) on our paper about element abundance ratios in the SDSS-V  data. We find (like others) that the abundances can be explained pretty precisely with only two processes. My position (contrary to others) is that this is  because there are two dominant kinds of supernovae! It is because the disk mixes gas quickly in the azimuthal direction, such that a star&#x27;s properties are mainly set by the (cosmic) time at which it was born, and the radius at which it was born. If I&#x27;m right, then you can&#x27;t really use disk stars to understand process yields, since they are always an ugly mixture of processes. If I am wrong, there&#x27;s lots more to do!realAPOGEEnot</span>

                              <span>In 1960, Princess Samdech Preah Reach Kanitha Norodom Rasmi Sobbhana published one of the first definitive texts on her country’s cuisine. L&#x27;Art de la cuisine cambodgienne, or The Culinary Art of Cambodia, was an extensively researched, beautifully illustrated tome years in the making. It came at a pivotal moment, just seven years after Cambodia declared independence, when the nation was fighting to codify an identity beyond that of its former French-colonial rulers.

Only a few years after the princess’s death in 1971, civil war ripped Khmer society apart. The Khmer Rouge, under the leadership of Prime Minister Pol Pot, purged Cambodia’s artists and intellectuals, along with records that detailed much of what came before “Year Zero” on April 17, 1975.

                              <span>Adjacent to Prague Castle, the hill of Petřín presents a panoramic view of the city and boasts numerous attractions, including a funicular, an observatory, a 19th-century mirror maze, and a haunting memorial dedicated to the victims of Communism. Up on the green slopes, there is also a historic monument dating back to the Middle Ages: the Hunger Wall of Prague.

Built by the order of Charles IV, the first King of Bohemia to become the Holy Roman Emperor, the defensive wall was completed in 1362, built out of marlstone quarried from Petřín Hill. Originally up to 4.5 meters (14 feet) tall, the wall is believed to have been constructed to strengthen Prague Castle&#x27;s defenses. It has been renovated multiple times throughout history, particularly in 1624 and recently in 1975.

As suggested by its evocative name, the wall comes with a story. It was originally referred to as Zubatá (&quot;toothed&quot;) after its bastioned appearance, but soon people started calling it Chlebová (&quot;for bread&quot;) or Hladová (&quot;hungry&quot;) following the famine in 1361. The construction provided a great deal of labor for the people of Prague, giving them a job and, thus, bread to live on.

According to local folklore, this was the very purpose of the wall&#x27;s construction in the first place, rather than the city&#x27;s defense. Later historians, in the 15th and 16th centuries, also claimed that King Charles IV himself visited the construction site every day and even worked with his people, whom he called his dear family, for several hours a day.</span>

                              <span>An exceptional vignette of Danish food and drink, this spot keeps the local schnapps flowing alongside seafood-focused open face sandwiches that are emblematic of the region. Since 1877, Restaurant Schønnemann has built up a deserved reputation for serving some of the finest smoørrebrød in the capital. The menu allows for easy sampling of signature local flavors, including the sweeter smaller shrimp found in this part of the world. 

In a dish this simple, details are everything and they&#x27;re fastidiously on-point here. Silky smoked salmon, smoked eel tartare, and white fish sit atop the Danish canvas of rye cradled by kitschy fishy themed porcelain. The bread is baked in house, many of the cheeses are aged in nearby caves, and the herring is cured and aged by the expert chefs. The dark-wood interior has an air of Old World grandeur, making for an especially atmospheric lunch.</span>

                              <span>Alongside an old Roman and Celtic road in Luxembourg stands a marker honoring a mysterious figure known as &quot;the Dead Woman.&quot; Also known as Doudeg Fra or La Femme Morte, the origins of this marker aren&#x27;t entirely clear.

One theory is that the site was a location for an ancient sanctuary dedicated to the Roman goddess Diana or to the Alma Mater, a religious symbol of fertility.

Another interpretation of the “Dead Woman” is that it represents Elisabeth of Görlitz (1391–1451). In 1388, King Wencelaus pledged the territory of Luxembourg for his debts against his cousin Jobst of Moravia. After his death in 1409, his widow Elisabeth of Görlitz had been the only Pawnee of Luxembourg. To pay off the debts of her deceased husband, Elisabeth had to sell Luxembourg to the Duke Philippe of Burgundy in 1441.

According to ancient records from the Heiliggeist Monastery, the sale took place at the exact location of the Dead Woman monument using a traditional sales ritual called &quot;hand hitting,&quot; where the seller holds a branch and a handful of soil in their hand and a buyer must hit the seller’s hand until they drop the branch and soil. Legend says that immediately after the sale was completed, Elisabeth of Görlitz said “Now I am a dead woman.” It&#x27;s unclear what Elisabeth meant by this and whether her use of the word &quot;dead&quot; should be understood to mean she was “done,” “ineffectual,” or “worthless.” According to tradition, it&#x27;s custom to leave offerings of branches at this location and place them with the words “This is for the dead woman.”

Until the middle of the 20th century, Doudeg Fra was marked by a crucifix perched on several stone blocks. However, in 1982 this was replaced by the current marker, which features a carved crucifix scene.</span>

                              <span>Crvenkapa (&quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;) is the nickname of the YU Bizniz Centar complex in Blok 12 of Novi Beograd. This business, residential, and shopping complex on Bulevar Mihajla Pupina earned its nickname thanks to its striking red details in contrast to the building&#x27;s white facade. After initial designs in the 1990s, it appeared in Belgrade in the early 2000s.

Known as &quot;the building with sails&quot;, the YUBC, known earlier as the NBG Centar, had once been considered one of the most luxurious residential buildings for social housing. Designed by the Serbian architect Mario Jobst with GP Energoprojekt as the investor and contractor, the settlement was built in a supposedly Mediterranean style and served as an artistic expression of the architect who is known to emphasize red in his constructions. Having been inspired by the Danube as well as the sails of ships, Jobst sought to display ornamentation in a part of the city predominantly defined by grey Brutalism.  

On the ground, it is unmissable to the foreign eye. Being quite a big complex, you will be able to observe a plethora of &quot;futuristic&quot; glass, concrete, red, and green elements.</span>

                              <span>After the Caribbean coast, cenotes are likely the most recognizable natural features of the Yucatan Peninsula. These sinkholes come in several shapes and sizes, and their importance was recognized by the indigenous Maya peoples, not only as freshwater sources but also for their belief systems. A certain cenote has even gained the name of &quot;Pet Cemetery&quot; due to the large number of animal bones found at its bottom. Many other cenotes are known for their wealth of religious offerings such as jewelry.

Ziiz Ha (&quot;cold waterwell&quot; in Yucatec Mayan) currently stands on the grounds of the Catholic convent of San Bernardino de Siena, built in the mid-16th century, and is covered by a colonial stone structure that appears to be a well. Even with this construction, which obstructs access to the cenote&#x27;s waters even more than the natural cave above it already did, Ziiz Ha has been explored by diving archaeologists for decades.

Rather than pre-Columbian jewelry or prehistoric animal bones, what they have found here dates to the Colonial era that defines its architectural surroundings. Weapons, most of them artillery, dating from the 18th and 19th centuries were a bulk of the findings. The origins of these firearms, cannonballs, and similar objects represent the Colonial history of the region, as they include not only Spanish examples but also several British ones. This is due to the production of weapons in the British Empire, as well as their arming of troops and civilians in colonies.

The weapons were discarded either to keep them away from enemy hands or just to get rid of them. The huge haul of colonial war artifacts found in the cenote represents an important archaeological heritage.</span>

                              <span>Opened in May 2022, this is the first museum in the United Kingdom solely focused on queer history. It was founded by Ian Mehrtens and Joseph Galliano in response to the 50th anniversary of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which ended the criminalization of homosexuality in England and Wales. This space was created for queer people to remember their struggles, find their communities and celebrate their success.

The collection includes the door to the prison cell of Oscar Wilde in Reading Gaol, the iconic top hat of Anne Lister aka &quot;Gentleman Jack,&quot; and a dress from the legendary drag performer Divine.

The museum is spread across two floors with gallery spaces, exhibition areas, and a small store. Talks, events, and new exhibitions are filled with growing enthusiastic energy and plans for the expansion of the collection.</span>

                              <span>Robert Burns, widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland is a figure celebrated across the world and the Robert Burns Statue in Sydney, Australia is one of many statues that pay tribute to his work.

Burns was born in Ayrshire, Scotland on January 25, 1759, and many of his poetry and folk songs remain well known worldwide for example Auld Lang Syne, which is often sung on December 31st.  

Constructed from bronze and sitting on a granite pedestal, the statue was erected by the Burns Memorial Committee and was unveiled in January 1905. It&#x27;s said that several thousand onlookers came to witness the official unveiling. 

The statue sits within The Domain, a large heritage-listed open space in Sydney that holds great historic and cultural significance to the development of the city.</span>

As the murmur of conversation spilling out of local restaurants blends with children’s laughter from the nearby playground, something magically mundane is about to happen. It starts around sunset with the clicking sound of the neighborhood’s beloved gas lamps firing up. Then comes the familiar golden glow Berliners have lived by for nearly two centuries.

But these scenes are fading fast in the city home to more than half the world’s working gas streetlamps. Since 2011, the German city has been working on converting them to LED alternatives—a process brought back into sharp focus by climate change and Russia’s war against Ukraine—leaving conservationists feeling that Berlin is losing something with…</span>

Blades of Glory Cricket Museum is the creation of Rohan Pate, a former under-19 cricket player, who single-handedly collected a treasure trove of cricket memorabilia and souvenirs. The museum was formally inaugurated by cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in 2012.

The museum is spread over 5,000 square feet. It&#x27;s said to have a collection of over 50,000 items out of which, around 2,000 are on display in the museum gallery.

There are bats signed by World Cup-winning teams, signed balls, jerseys and caps, scoreboards of popular players, and entire sections dedicated to certain legends. Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Vivian Richards, Sunil Gavaskar, Allan Border, Sachin Tendulkar, and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are some of the names whose signed souvenirs are on display.

It was awarded a world record by the World Record Academy based in Miami. It has also been honored with several other records and certificates. Many renowned cricket players from across the world have visited this museum over the years.</span>

See Miami’s Waterfront Through Its Midcentury Modern Lifeguard Stations

by Isaac Schultz

For most of the 20th century, Miami&#x27;s beaches were home to pretty standard lifeguard towers. But after Hurricane Andrew razed a number of them in 1995, the architectural firm William Lane designed some pretty eccentric and memorable replacements that are equal parts futuristic and midcentury modern—and oh-so-Miami.

                              <span>U.S. Highway 97 extends from Weed, California, up to the Canadian border. It runs along the eastern side of the Cascades and is a major north-south route that has become more important with the burgeoning development in eastern Oregon and Washington. Indeed, it has become an alternate trucking route to Interstate-5. Traditionally called The Dalles-California highway in Oregon, it goes directly through Bend, now the largest population center in Oregon east of the Cascades.

About 2.5 miles north of Terrebonne, Oregon US-97 crosses the Crooked River on a high bridge over the Crooked River Gorge. The current span, the Rex T. Barber Veteran Memorial Bridge, was completed in 2000. It is a concrete arch with a span of 410 feet (125 meters) some 300 feet (91 meters) above the river, which places it 22nd in height among U.S. bridges. It replaced the Crooked River High Bridge, which had become inadequate with the increasing traffic on the highway. The High Bridge was built in 1926 and consists of a steel arch with a main span 330 feet (100 meters) long. About 350 feet downstream of the current bridge, it has been preserved for foot traffic, and is the second-highest span to be converted to pedestrian use after Navajo Bridge in Arizona.

A railroad bridge crosses the gorge about 850 feet downstream of the High Bridge. Built in 1911, it consists of a two-hinge arch with a span of 460 feet (140 meters). Both highway bridges mimicked the arch design of the original railroad bridge for aesthetic reasons. This bridge, now part of the BNSF Railway system, is still in use.</span>

                              <span>As mentioned , structural glasses are materials in which there is no periodic lattice (no long-range spatial order) and the building blocks get &quot;stuck&quot; in some configuration, kinetically unable to get to the true energetic minimum state which would almost certainly be a periodic crystal.  Upon cooling from the liquid state, their viscosity increases by many orders of magnitude () until they act like rigid solids.  Distinguishing &quot;glassy&quot; physics includes strongly interacting building blocks, a complicated energy landscape with many local minima, spatial disorder leading to hugely varying interaction strengths and a very broad distribution of relaxation times (so that responses to perturbations aren&#x27;t simple exponentials in time, but are more slowly decaying functions such as \(-\log t\)). …</span>

                              <span>Kate Storey-Fisher (NYU) defended her PhD here at NYU today. She killed it! She talked about emulating cosmological simulations (at the level of statistics, not maps), making invariant scalars that encode the shapes and dynamics of dark-matter halos, and her awesome 1.2 million all-sky quasar catalog from ESA  and NASA . It was all things my loyal reader knows lots about but I loved it. It has been an honor and a privilege to work with KSF these years, and I will miss her very very much.GaiaWISE</span>

                              <span>Aanaar isn’t easy for many tourists—or for that matter, food suppliers—to reach. Located in Inari, a remote municipality in Finland’s northernmost Sápmi region, the acclaimed restaurant inside the Hotel Kultahovi draws inspiration from traditional northern foods and relies on the surrounding countryside for ingredients.

Chef Dāvis Sausnītis’s team cooks with meats like reindeer, whitefish, Arctic char, and lake trout, and scours dense woodlands for seasonal fare ranging from berries and leaves to mushrooms and mosses. But one evergreen ingredient that finds its way onto the menu are the forest’s trees themselves: pine needles and shoots, pinecones, and even ground pine bark are incorporated into entrees, desserts, drinks, and condiments, providing guests with a particularly pungent taste…</span>

                              <span>What girl would not want to get a devotion of love in the form of a road in her name? Like a 19th-century graffiti, local legend has it that the &quot;M&quot;—that stands out on a straight road that could have continued straight towards the mountain—was created by an Austro-Hungarian engineer Josip Slade-Šilović who was in love with a Montenegrin princess called Milena.

Tasked with designing a modern road for cars from Kotor to Cetinje following the Berlin Congress in 1878, this designer from Trogir was later a palace builder and created a rut in the road with an &quot;M&quot; symbol. Montenegrin writer Jovan J. Martinović has since passed on the joke of the people of Cetinje, which was created at the expense of this letter M: &quot;And imagine if he accidentally fell in love with Princess Olga—the road wouldn&#x27;t end without the song of gusles (a Montenegrin fiddle)!&quot;

Austro-Hungarian influence can be seen all over Montenegro. Generally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire improved the Montenegrin infrastructure greatly as compared to the Ottoman Empire which is largely revered and documented by song and poem in how much sorrow it caused to the entire region. A lot of Montenegro&#x27;s oldest and sturdiest roads were built by Austro-Hungarian engineers, such as this one by the secret crush of Milena, which has been preserved almost entirely in its original form.</span>

                              <span>The Concrete Cows in Milton Keynes, England, are an iconic work of sculpture, created in 1978 by the American artist Liz Leyh. There are three cows and three calves, approximately half the size of their living counterparts.

Over the years they have been known to travel. One taking a journey and popping up across the U.K. Some were briefly moved when the new shopping was built and there were given pride of place in the middle.

Icons of the new city, there are actually two sets of Concrete Cows. The cows that call Bancroft Park home are the replica second set created by Bill Billings due to the original set, created by artist Liz Leyh with the community for the Milton Keynes Development Corporation, being quite delicate. The original herd can be found in their new home at Milton Keynes Museum in Wolverton.

Like the Triceratops created by Bill Billings at Peartree Bridge, the Concrete Cows were created from concrete and chicken wire.</span>

                              <span>This quaint shopping arcade is the oldest in the city of Rosario, housing very curious, charming little stores like a luthier workshop and even the local Esperanto Association.

In 1890, Andres Pan, a prosperous Spanish immigrant built this place to rent stores. Legend has it that his ghost still haunts the corridors at night, waiting to receive his tenants’ money.

Today Pasaje Pan houses a wide range of interesting stores selling jewelry, artworks, and vintage second-hand books. Many artists have their ateliers in the different offices on the second floor. In the basement, there is an art gallery with regular exhibits and performances.

So, if you want to buy an artistic souvenir or learn to speak a bit of Esperanto, Pasaje Pan is your ideal place. You will not be disappointed.</span>

                              <span>Iowa&#x27;s Maquoketa Caves State Park is home to enormous bluffs and a six-mile trail system that winds through geologic formations and dense woodlands. The park was officially established in 1921, but it has been drawing human visitors for hundreds, possibly thousands of years. Artifacts discovered in the caves include pottery, tools, and stone projectile points.

About 13 caves can be found in the park, including the 1,100-foot “Dancehall Cave” and many others such as Hernado’s Hideaway, Shinbone Cave, and Wye Cave. Some of these stone caverns can be explored by walking, while others are better suited for serious spelunkers who are comfortable in tight spaces.</span>

                              <span>From Monterrey, climb the Cerro del Mirador mountain, and find the Church of Schönstatt amongst the hilltops. Leave comfort behind, depart on a physical journey, and find peace away from the big city. There are many of these little chapels located worldwide. However, the Schönstatt Catholic movement originated in Germany. 

The chapel sits sensitively in the beautiful and quiet landscape. The scenery is idyllic, the brisk winds are reassuring, and the valley beyond creates an atmosphere of tranquillity. Despite the chapel’s unassuming size, it certainly has a way of drawing visitors in closer. When you first catch a glimpse of the structure, the stained glass windows glisten in the sun like gemstones, and the crowning bell perched atop the pitched roof adds a quiet touch of dignity. 

It’s almost as if this humble yet charming little church takes on a personality of its own, beckoning visitors closer, whispering, “Look at me, look at me.”

Inside the chapel, sheltered from the elements, the structure cocoons you. The walls are washed with sunlight entering thru the windows, creating a symphony of color. Along the central aisle, the rows of pews at either side lead you toward the altar. There, directly ahead of you, an image of the Virgin Mary is enshrined, beautifully constructed in an ornate dark wood, aka el Santuario de Schönstatt. The daylight streams down upon the shrine of Mary and intensifies the atmosphere of peace and stillness.

Mary’s Road to Heaven, aka María, Camino al Cielo, is a pilgrimage dedicated to the Virgin Mary that is open to everyone. It’s a journey that leaves the everyday behind. An upward climb of 1,200 feet. A trail of discovery in the quiet of the mountains. And a pathway to peace away from the bustling city.</span>

                              <span>Scattered in and around the 47 square miles that make up the city of San Francisco are 220 parks. They vary in size, from the sprawling green space that is Golden Gate Park to the minuscule one that is Mary Ellen Pleasant Memorial Park. Which basically covers the ground that consists of six eucalyptus trees and a plaque.

Mary Ellen Pleasant was born into slavery sometime at the beginning of the 1900s and escaped persecution when she arrived in California in 1852. She amassed a great fortune through her popular businesses, which included; dairies, laundries, and high-class restaurants. She had a penchant for being very savvy and forthright with her finances. So much so that she became one of America&#x27;s first Black female millionaires, along with Madam C.J. Walker.

In addition to hiring formerly enslaved people to work in her many enterprises, Pleasant also donated large sums of money to support the Underground Railroad. This was a vast network of people who would offer aid and shelter to enslaved people. She also campaigned for the end of slavery in the state of California and fought to desegregate the city&#x27;s street cars.

The city of San Francisco designated the six trees Pleasant planted herself, along with the plaque, as a Structure of Merit in 1974. The area of Octavia and Bush Streets is in the vicinity of where the &quot;Mother of Civil Rights in California&quot; once owned a mansion. It&#x27;s common for ghost tours to start at the small park, where some say that Pleasant&#x27;s spirit remains among the trees.</span>

                              <span>One of Germany&#x27;s oldest churches, Bonn Minster was built between the 11th and 13th centuries. It was the collegiate church of Saints Cassius and Florentius, third-century Roman legionaries of the legendary all-Christian Theban Legion.

According to the legend, the Legion&#x27;s garrison was ordered by Roman Emperor Maxentius Herculius to march to Gaul. While on their way, the Emperor either ordered the Legion to massacre fellow Christians or worship him as a god. The soldiers refused, resulting in their martyrdom. Cassius and Florentius were beheaded on the site where Bonn Minster stands today.

In 2002, German-Turkish sculptor Iskender Yediler created a pair of giant granite sculptures, replicating the heads of the two saints portrayed at the church. They have been placed in front of Bonn Minster, lying mid-roll in a somewhat surreal manner.

Inside the church, a pair of 18th-century hardwood busts depicting Cassius and Florentius were discovered in its storehouse in 2006. Restored, they are put on display during the festive times in October above the entrance to the crypt.</span>

                              <span>Upon entering the garden, a short walking loop leads through statuesque gardens. Like the rest of the garden, the succulent rockery is divided into geographic ecozones where Joshua trees, cacti, and Aloes dominate the Americas, and prickly turgid Europhobia in the African section. The plants come in many looming shapes and sizes, some old and slow-growing looming over eight feet high.

The tall buildings of the CBD can be seen above the eastern entrance to the garden while the garden is boarded on one side by the NSW State Herbarium. 

Like the grounds of the wider botanic gardens, the succulent rockery has a layered colonial history. Before the modern planting, the site held Australia’s first zoo which operated from 1862-1883. The zoo was started by the NSW acclimatization society, an organization whose objective was to introduce exotic flora and fauna to Australia. Its first residents included an anteater and Chinese deer. In 1883, the zoo was relocated to Moore Park south of the gardens.

In 1936, the first iteration of the cacti and succulent rockery was built and a larger garden was completed in 1983. The rockery also features a rustic sculpture garden by Jamie Durie which was added in 2007.</span>

                              <span>Lake Macdonnell is the name given to this impressive body of water which sits around nine miles (15 kilometers) to the south of the South Australian town of Penong. Situated on the Eyre Peninsula, the lake sits on the Nullarbor Plain, a large arid desert that is one of the country&#x27;s most unique landscapes. Visitors to Lake Macdonnell have to drive along a dirt track before being rewarded with magnificent views of the water.

When the conditions are right, the lake appears salmon pink in color and the high salt concentration gives a unique reflection effect. This special coloring is caused by dunaliella salina, an algae species that thrives in hypersaline conditions, and halobacteria that secrete a red pigment called carotenoid.

The lake also has an interesting industrial history and for many years was a booming salt mine. Gypsum, a soft sulfate mineral, has also been mined at the site since 1919, and this location is Australia&#x27;s largest mine of this type and is thought to be one of the largest gypsum deposits in the southern hemisphere.</span>

                              <span>Few airlines capture the romance of air travel&#x27;s golden age more than Pan American World Airways, commonly known as Pan Am. Founded by Juan T. Trippe in 1927 and originally connecting the U.S. with Latin America, Pan Am grew to serve a worldwide network of destinations, first with large flying boats and later with jets.

In the late 1960s, Pan Am worked closely with Boeing on the design of the 747, the original Jumbo Jet and one of the world&#x27;s most recognizable aircraft. but after Trippe&#x27;s retirement in 1968, Pan Am began to fall on hard times. The oil crisis of the 1970s lowered demand for travel, and airline deregulation brought increased competition. Pan Am sold off most of its assets before finally declaring bankruptcy and ceasing operations in December 1991. 

While Pan Am airplanes no longer crisscross the skies, its iconic brand and legacy live on. Movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Catch Me If You Can prominently feature the airline. The airline also lives on in subtler ways: the reason why the pilot in command of an airliner is referred to as &quot;captain,&quot; for example, traces its roots to Pan Am and its magnificent flying boats. 

The third floor of the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, Long Island, is known as Pan Am Museum, operated by the Pan Am Museum Foundation. It tells the story of the airline&#x27;s 64-year history with original artifacts and scale models, as well as artwork. Those who never got the chance to fly aboard a Pan Am Clipper can be transported back in time to the heart of the jet age at the Pan Am Museum.</span>

                              <span>Today it was my honor to serve on the PhD defense committee of Irina Espejo (NYU), who is one of the first (ever in the world, actually!) PhDs in Data Science. Her PhD research involved making real, practical, scalable, reproducible tools for the (late-in-pipeline) analysis of high-energy physics data from the . She built tools to speed up likelihood-free inferences, and she built a tool to find exclusion regions (upper limits) in complex parameter spaces. She used the latter to put constraints on a (real, not toy) proposed modification to the standard model.Large Hadron Collider
On the first project, the tools that she built (and built on) make the LHC more sensitive to new physics, because they find better test statistics for distinguishing models. They make some searches  better, which makes me wonder whether particle physics is using our money efficiently??far</span>

                              <span>The Nullarbor Roadhouse is one of the few resting places on the Nullarbor Plain, known for its vast, arid landscape in the region.

Originally operating as a remote outback station, the Nullarbor Station covered acres of land with paddocks of horses, sheep, and cattle grazing. As the infrastructure of Australia grew, a decision was made by the station manager in 1956 to begin selling petroleum to the hardy passersby who navigated the arduous gravel roads at that time. 

A small shop soon was then built, selling snacks and drinks and the Nullarbor Roadhouse then became a much-needed rest stop. In 1976, the Eyre Highway was completed and this allowed much easier access for those making the journey across the Nullarbor Plain.

At this time, a new roadhouse building was built and the same building has been restored with original artifacts to allow visitors to take a step back in time. The old building contains historic signs, original food and drink packaging, and an old petroleum pump, all of which have shown significant decay due to the extreme weather conditions here.</span>

                              <span>Originally named Wat Kok Khwai, the Buddhist temple now known as Wat Yannawa or the “Boat Temple” was built during the Ayutthaya era, before the founding of Bangkok. It was merely a local place of worship until King Rama I granted it royal status and made the ordination hall known as subosot in Thai.

During the reign of Rama III (1824-1851), a defining feature was added to the temple complex: a viharn (monastery) in the shape of a Chinese junk. At the time, the junk ship was becoming obsolete and starting to be replaced by newer, more modern vessels. It is believed that King Rama III wished to preserve the image of the Chinese junk in the mind of his people.

Thanks to this unique feature, it was not long before the locals started to coin its nickname, Wat Yannawa (literally “boat temple”), which would stick and become its official name. With the two chedis designed to resemble masts, it also gained the nickname Sampao Chedi, the “Chinese junk with chedis,” as it looked more like a ship than a temple.

Today, besides the junk-shaped viharn, the temple complex contains multiple buildings enshrining images and a relic of the Buddha, effigies of Kuan Im, the goddess of mercy, and large paintings of the Loy Krathong lantern festival. In front of the “boat” stands a bronze statue of Rama III, looking proud that his image of the Chinese junk has lived on beyond his life.</span>

                              <span>Beneath the streets of Windsor lies a time capsule, buried in 2011 and sealed for 50 years. Its contents encapsulate through images, information, and videos, what the town of Windsor was like in 2011. However, it&#x27;s not the capsule that captures the attention of passersby.

Fixed within the pavement is a working clock, ticking away under the feet of pedestrians. It was installed alongside the time capsule below, it sits within the same space as a previous pavement clock, originally installed in 1950. Sir Cyril Dyson, jeweler and clockmaker for the queen, sunk the clock into the pavement outside his shop as a showcase of his skills. The original clock went missing in the 1980s following the closure of Dyson’s store.

The pavement clock of Windsor is thought to be one of a kind in Britain, and those brave enough to level their ear to the timepiece have reported the distinct tick-tock of its mechanism emanating from below.</span>

                              <span>An hour and a half south of Washington, D.C. lies a small air museum with a remarkable collection, including one-of-a-kind airplanes.

Sidney Shannon Jr. was a businessman and pilot whose father was one of the founders of Eastern Air Lines. In 1950, Shannon founded Shannon Airport, an airport for general aviation (small, private planes) just outside of Fredericksburg, Virginia.

An air museum on the property was opened in 1976. From its beginning, the museum has housed a collection of rare aircraft from the &quot;golden age of flight&quot;. Following Sidney Shannon&#x27;s death in 1981, the future of the airport and museum was uncertain. For a while, the collection was moved to another museum in Richmond. In 2017, however, the museum was reopened and the collection returned to its original home.

Several of the aircraft on exhibit, including the Vultee V-1AD Special, are the only remaining example of their type. Other rare aircraft include a Pitcairn Mailwing PA-5 and a Bellanca CH-400 Skyrocket.</span>

                              <span>Visiting St. Peter Stiftskulinarium is a spiritual and gastronomic pilgrimage.  Located within the expansive confines of Salzburg&#x27;s St. Peter&#x27;s Abbey, a 7th-century Benedictine monastery, its existence was first chronicled by Alcuin of York, a scholar and trusted advisor to Charlemagne.

Wandering these hallowed halls, one can’t help but imagine Mephistopheles talking shop with Faust, or Christopher Columbus raising a glass of Salzburg Stiegl beer before his historic voyage. While legends persist, the establishment’s age is undeniable. St. Peter Stiftskulinarium, mentioned in documents dating back to 803, claims to be the oldest known operating restaurant in Europe.

The restaurant’s grandeur extends across 11 dining rooms, each with its own elaborate design and tapestry of captivating anecdotes. From the opulent Baroque Hall to the intimate “citizens’ room” Prälatenstube, the establishment is certainly a feast for the eyes. With an 850-person capacity, it also offers ample opportunity for people-watching.

The Stiftskulinarium’s kitchen prides itself on serving upscale regional specialties, including the Viennese classic tafelspitz (slow-simmered beef in broth and vegetables) and Salzburger Nockerl a sweet dessert soufflé made with egg yolk, flour, sugar and vanilla. With changing seasons, the menu embraces diverse local flavors, showcasing fresh fish, game dishes, and often imaginative influences from Mediterranean cuisine.

As twilight descends, the restaurant’s renowned Mozart Dinner Concert takes place. Every night, the Baroque Hall’s high stuccoed ceilings are illuminated by candlelight across white gala tables. In collaboration with the Salzburg Concert Society, the dining experience features a three-course menu of authentic 17th- and 18th-century recipes accompanied by live musical performances featuring the work of Salzsburg’s most famous native, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Performers and stewards in fanciful period attire add to the time-warp flair.</span>

In a rural town along the San Juan River in southeastern Utah, an esteemed botanist and local innkeeper got to talking in the summer of 1937. Together, the pair hatched a plan—to run the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. A journey like theirs had never before been attempted. The University of Michigan botanist, Elzada Clover, intended to make the first-ever botanical survey of the river and its environs. The innkeeper, Norman Nevills, wanted to commercialize trips down the Colorado River (despite never having run the river himself). The next summer Clover and Nevills, along with two other boatmen, a photographer, and botanist Lois Jotter, Elzada’s close…</span>

                              <span>Ningaloo George, also known as the &quot;Big Whale Shark&quot; is an impressive fiberglass sculpture found on the grounds of a petrol station in the remote Australian town of Exmouth.

The art was designed and constructed by local artist Brian Paskins and was unveiled to the public on January 31, 2002. The town sits on the tip of the North West Cape of Australia and is well known for the marine life found here, making it a popular spot for tourists snorkeling and diving on the Ningaloo Reef.  

Whale sharks are one of many species that can be found off the coast of Exmouth and this sculpture pays tribute to their migration to the reef between the months of March to June. They are the largest species of sharks and visit the Ningaloo Reef due to the mass spawning of coral which brings abundant feeding opportunities.</span>

                              <span>Many universities across the world have their own museums dedicated to a variety of subjects and collections. Regis College in Weston, Massachusettes has one located on the southern edge of its campus. However, this location is quite distinctive as it&#x27;s one of the few museums in the United States dedicated to the study and collecting of postage stamps, also known as Philately.

Founded in 1961, the Spellman Museum of Stamps &amp; Postal History, or the Cardinal Spellman Philatelic Museum is the oldest museum of its kind in the United States. It is also the second largest collection of philatelic material after the National Postal Museum operated by the Smithsonian. Its founder was Cardinal Francis Spellman, who served as the sixth Archbishop of New York from 1939 to 1967 and previously as the auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston from 1932 to 1939. He was also an avid philatelic.

Today, the museum contains over two million items including Spellman&#x27;s personal collection, pieces from the former National Philatelic Museum in Philadelphia as well as donations from the general public.

Its principal mission is to preserve and promote knowledge of history, geography, art, culture, architecture, science, and nature through the story of stamps and postage.</span>

The main building of the museum is home to a very comprehensive display of knives, the history of cutlery, and its tradition in Thiers. The second building is a forge where museum employees showcase knife-making techniques. 

From its installation in artisanal form until the start of its industrialization, the museum traces the social and economic history of cutlery in Thiers. It pays tribute to the workers who have developed their skills under highly challenging working conditions. The development of the jurande, a trade body an oath was created to observe the regulations of their trade, but also a commitment of solidarity.</span>

The 12-foot, brightly painted, fountain was designed by architect Richard H. Bollinger. Its ornate design includes a large center basin with four smaller basins at the corners, each decorated with detailed carvings of firefighting equipment and symbols.

Over the years, the Fireman’s Drinking Fountain has become an iconic symbol of the community’s history and heritage. The location and the colors make this fountain a hard-to-miss landmark.</span>

                              <span>On the plane home from meetings at Cambridge, Warwick, and Paris, I worked on a long document I am writing for  DPAC CU5, which is the organization responsible for calibrating and extracting the  XP spectra. They are doing a beautiful self-calibration to extract all the spectra on the same system, in the sense of resolution, dispersion, and throughput. But their system has some pathologies, which we discussed last week. I think I know how to solve some of them. My document is reporting those thoughts.GaiaGaia
Writing like this reminds me of graduate school: One of my advisors (Blandford) often encouraged me to write up thoughts, ideas, projects, and proposals, even when we had no intention of submitting them anywhere. It&#x27;s good practice, I think, because you can&#x27;t understand anything if you don&#x27;t write about it.</span>

                              <span>A unique mushroom-shaped building hides at the bottom of the cliffs at Blacks Beach in San Diego. The architect Dal Nagle designed and built it in 1968 for Sam Bell, owner of Bell Brand Snack Foods. He wanted a futuristic-looking house that could withstand naturally occurring rock slides, earthquakes, and waves.

The original name was the Bell Pavillion, and you could access it from the cliffs via a nearly vertical tramway that ran almost 300 feet down the cliff. It was also used as a guest house, offering a 180-degree view from Torrey Pines State Park to La Jolla.

The house is currently abandoned, and its cliffside tram hasn&#x27;t run in years. Though it sits in a state of disrepair along the San Diego beach, the sturdy concrete structure remains intact.</span>

                              <span>You know the feeling. The door opens onto a white expanse. The light is overwhelming; you can feel it in your head and instinctively raise a hand to cover your eyes. Then the white fades out to the edges. You might see green on the trees, or the blue of water, or the gray of a motel parking lot. It’s summer. There’s a breeze. And you have a whole day and night ahead of you.

This is how we at Atlas Obscura think of the beginning of summer—blinding, then full of opportunity and the potential for adventure. To celebrate that feeling and the potential it carries, this year we’re presenting our first-ever season-long special section: Summer of Wonder.

For the next three months, we’re going to be exploring three themes that capture some of the magic of being outside in the summertime:


On the Road: Road tripping and roadside attractions, modern and historical

Summer Nights: Starry skies, fireflies, and nostalgia

Go Wild: Encounters with the natural world (with a preview of one of Atlas Obscura’s big new projects)


Summer of Wonder will include stories that explore overlooked corners of history, food, and the natural world, as well as recommendations that can help you make the most of your escapades—from itineraries and roadside geology, to stargazing and recognizing some of the creatures you might meet (or dream of) along the way.

Charge your battery or fill up your tank. We’ve got miles ahead of us.</span>

                              <span>This site was once a secret private property that was kept a close secret by locals. It was a place to sneak away to with friends in spring to play in the flowers until the early 2000s. The property is now called Parson Reserve and is a part of the DNRT Trust. The first daffodils were planted on the property during World War II and now there are thousands of them throughout the woods.

The trails are open year-round but the best time to see the flowers is in the spring (April). The daffodil field is up a steep wooded trail and hidden from view of the road. The trails DNRT keeps up the trails and they are lightly marked so it&#x27;s easy to find the way. People aren&#x27;t allowed to walk or pick the flowers anymore, but there are narrow walking paths through them.</span>

So they made it their mission to seek out what lay beyond these limited search results. And what they found was a world brimming with everything from Pakistani hot chicken and Uzbek dumplings to Turkish flatbreads and roast brisket on rye.

“There&#x27;s this multiculturalism of different kinds of restaurants and people just wanting to try other people&#x27;s food,” says Azad, one-third of the team of food bloggers known collectively as Muslim Foodies. Since 2017, Azad, Choudhry, and Baksh have reviewed around 370 New York area halal restaurants for their blog and gained an international…</span>

This wasn&#x27;t just any juice stand. It was Gibeau Orange Julep, a towering dome run by a family that’s slung their orange juleps—a creamier take on squeezed citrus, thanks to the addition of powdered egg—since the 1930s.

&quot;Most people spend, like, a year planning that,&quot; he laughs. &quot;I just go.&quot;

Awe: The New Science of Everyday Wonder and How It Can Transform Your Life

By Dacher Keltner

In January, Atlas Obscura spoke with Dacher Keltner, a leading expert on the biology of human emotion and a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, about the science of awe and how it impacts our experience of the world. His book takes a closer look at how this phenomenon has shaped human stories across cultures and time—and how it may play a role in your summer adventu…</span>

                              <span>The coast-to-coast road trip, that American essential, turns 120 this year. In 1903, Horatio Jackson and Sewall Crocker became the first people ever to drive a car from one side of the United States all the way to the other.

Cars were an exciting novelty at the time, and their numbers were exploding—from 8,000 in 1900 to 32,920 in 1903—but many still considered the “horseless carriage” a passing fad. There were few suitable roads, let alone a nationwide road network. So theirs was an adventure like none before. And it all started with a $50 bet.

This map is from the 1907 edition of the Automobile Association of America’s Blue Book. It shows the routes of all the cross-country car trips completed until then: no more than 11 in total—and strangely, all duos. (The Jackson-Crocker trip is …</span>

In the coastal town of Ocean City, crowds of out-of-towners descend upon the 2.5-mile long boardwalk, tying up coveted parking spaces and congregating outside beloved establishments like Johnson’s Caramel Popcorn and Manco &amp; Manco Pizza. Others stake their spots along OC’s narrow beaches, pitching enormous umbrellas and spreading out their chairs and blankets. There’s no question about it: the season of “shoobies&#x27;&#x27; has begun.

At first, the bodies are easy to overlook. But as summer progresses on Tuckernuck Island off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, more and more victims turn up. Their mangled corpses litter the roads and driveways. Despite their headless state, these victims are easy to identify. They are Narceus americanus, the American giant millipede. And no one knows what is killing them.

For decades, scientists have tried to find the answer to the question of why the headless millipedes turn up by the hundreds every summer on Tuckernuck. This phenomenon, on this scale, happens nowhere else on Earth. Identifying the culprit has implications beyond this small, sandy island: whatever animal is ultimately responsible, the answer may reveal a bran…</span>

The “Grad Student” dropped from the title, and the mysterious word “postdoc” showed up on a few pages. For three years I worked as a postdoc at the Perimeter Institute in Canada, before […]</span>

                              <span>There were discussions this week at University of Warwick about the Terra Hunting Experiment strategy and likely detection capability. Various take-homes include that we need to mitigate lots of stellar noise, and that we care deeply about the covariance (as a function of separation in time) of adjacent measurements. I advocated that we split our ten-year survey into two or three surveys, of varying length. In the first, we learn about the stars, and in the last, we go to town on the very most promising targets. There was general agreement that this is a good idea. But now we need a very specific plan for what this means. As my loyal reader knows, in my view, the decisions must be based on repeatable operations, so that we have some hope of learning statistical things about populations in the end.</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m at the  annual Science Working Group meeting, held this year at University of Warwick. There were many great talks today, some technical and some science. My mind was blown by Ben Lakeland (Exeter), who showed  data of the Sun, and then showed that, from these images, he can predict the magnetic-activity-generated RV signals in simultaneous EPRV measurements of the Solar RV. That&#x27;s pretty exciting. He also showed that much of the time, the RV variations are dominated not by magnetic activity . If we are going to beat one meter per second, we are going to have to correct for convective shifts. Somehow!?Terra HuntingSolar Dynamics Orbiterper se</span>

                              <span>I like the graphical lay out of Jordan-Holder. I&#x27;ve drawn pictures like this, but I hadn&#x27;t worked out the axiomatization of all possible pictures, which is really clarifying. It&#x27;s also good preparation for Schubert calculus: If you consider the case where your ground ring is a field, this is the recipe to assign a permutation to a pair of complete flags.

Could I make a notational suggestion? You call your modules M_i, M&#x27;_j and M_{i,j}. If you called them X_i, Y_j and Z_{i,j}, not only would they be more visually distinctive, but you could make it mnemonic -- X_i on the x-axis and Y_j on the y-axis. This would be particularly nice because you use the variables i, i&#x27;, j and j&#x27; later, and it surprised me that i and i&#x27; went with M while j and j&#x27; go with M&#x27;.</span>

I worked with Soledad Villar (Apple &amp; JHU) to generalize the k-means algorithm to point clouds! It can cluster point clouds morphologically, even if the different point clouds have different numbers of points, and even if the different point clouds live in spaces of different dimensions! Everything obeys permutation and rotation symmetries.ott-jax</span>

                              <span>It seems to me that in the definition and discussion of rank-a-maps of vector bundles (14.3.4. - 14.3.K.), the notation for the ranks of the loc. free sheaves is mixed up:

 - In Definition 13.4. you state that E is of rank b and F is of rank c, though in the commutative diagram they are of rank a+b and a+c respectively (upon restriction to some open U).

 - In exercise 14.3.J. you refer to the rank of the cokernel of a map of vector bundles. The notation here seems to contradict the diagram in 14.3.5.</span>

At the primary school level, typically people are taught that there are three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.  (Plasma may be introduced as a fourth state sometimes.)  These three states are readily distinguished because they have vastly different mechanical properties.  We now know that there are many more states of matter than just those few, because we have developed ways to look at materials that can see differences that are much more subtle than bulk mechanical response.  As I discussed a little bit , something is a &quot;solid&quot; if it resists being compressed and sheared; the constituent atoms/molecules are right up against each other, and through th…</span>

What is intelligence? Can machines really think? Can machines really become conscient?

                              <span>I was honored today by being invited to a meeting of the group at Cambridge (UK) that extracts and calibrates the low-resolution ESA  XP spectra. The model is bilinear: Each source is represented as a linear sum of basis functions, and each observation of each source has an expectation which is that linear sum multiplied by a convolution kernel, which is also represented as a sum of components. These components are smooth functions of position in the device and wavelength. It&#x27;s a very nice system! I went through it all with them and said what I would have done differently (which is not much, I have to admit).Gaia</span>

                              <span>The news that Arif Ahmed is to be appointed the UK’s first ‘Free Speech Tsar’ — a position that apparently comes with “the power to investigate universities and student unions in England and Wales that wrongly restrict debate” and to “advise the sector regulator on imposing fines for free speech breaches” — is disappointing for various reasons. One of them (not the most important one) is that it suggests Britain’s capacity to name things continues to decline. To see this once-great country reach for a foreign title that not only originates with one second-rate empire trying to recall the glory of the Romans but that was first popularized as a job-title within the administrative apparatus of another is really quite sad, given that England has so many equally preposterous but largely home-grown (or at least Norman French) titles available right on its own doorstep. It’s a scandal, really. A kind of Tsargate, if you will.
Here I present a few alternatives of my own, along with some excellent suggestions from others following up with me about this on social media. As an alternative to “Free Speech Tsar”, consider one or more of the following: The Duke of Discourse. Warden of All Chit-Chat. Equerry of Arguments. Gold Stick To The Point. The Earl of Axiom. The Keeper of the King’s Premises. The Wheedle Beadle. Chief Constable Counterexample. The Postillion of Positing. The Justiciar of Just One More Thing. The Marquess of My Question is More of a Comment. The Archbishop of Banterbury. The Lord Privy Sealion. Groom of the Discourse. Chancellor of the Factchequer. Red Herring Pursuivant. Master of the Eyerolls.
As should be clear, the capacity exists within the UK to develop an entire peerage system of Free Speech aristocrats of all ranks. I strongly encourage Rishi Sunak to implement just such a scheme as soon as is practicable.</span>
