          "description": "The city of Yokohama is home to a major international seaport, one of the busiest since 1859. Located close to its pier is the customs headquarters, an unusual historic building one might expect to find in Morocco rather than in Japan.\n\r\nConstructed in 1934, the Yokohama Customs headquarters is nicknamed “the Queen’s Tower” for its turquoise-domed minaret, and the rest of the building matches its style, with Moorish battlements and arched windows, partially inspired by ancient Indian architecture. There are also elements of Romanesque architecture here and there, creating an exotic vibe fit for a hub of international relations.\n\r\nThe construction plan was conceived as part of the Reconstruction of the Imperial Capital project, which sought to restore disaster-damaged cities in eastern Japan, as the original customs office was lost in the cataclysmic earthquake of 1923.\n\r\nInitially planned to be 154 feet (47 meters) tall, another 13 feet (4 meters ) were added to its height at the suggestion of the customs director. As a result, the Yokohama Customs building became the tallest structure in Yokohama at the time of its completion.\n\r\nIncidentally, the \"queen\" does not refer to any historical figure, but simply to the playing card, with the Kanagawa Prefectural Government office standing in for the King and the Yokohama Archives of History's clock tower for the Jack. Located close to each other, the three towers of Yokohama are a somewhat popular spot, best viewed from Ōsanbashi Pier.",

However, at the same latitude in Shaanxi Province of China lies a spectacle with even more stunning scenery—the Jingbian Red Wave Valley in Jingbian County, Shaanxi Province. \n\r\nThe Red Wave Valley is a fascinating example of the Danxia landform, primarily characterized by its striking red sandstone formations, which took shape between the Permian and Triassic periods, hundreds of millions of years ago. Over time, the relentless forces of wind and rain have meticulously crafted the landscape, creating a sinuous pattern akin to layers of rocky waves seemingly rushing toward the viewer. \n\r\nUnlike the red and white hues in Arizona, the Jingbian Wave Valley boasts a pure red palette set amidst the golden plateau. This vibrant red is anything but monotonous; it weaves intricate and captivating patterns as if each layer tells a unique story. Consequently, the locals affectionately refer to it as \"Flame Danxia.\"\n\r\nThe Jingbian Red Wave Valley offers various areas for exploration, each with its own distinct charm. Many of the pathways are paved to provide easy hiking and to preserve the delicate sandstone for generations to come.",

The rodent—a member of the ubiquitous species Rattus rattus, which arrived in North America with the Jamestown colonists—was living between the walls in a building that had variously been a home, a shop, a school, and a popular tavern. The rat’s family had likely been there for generations, gradually adding scraps of paper, fabric, crockery, bones, and miscellaneous debris to its massive nest. Pilfering the fork, however, was an unusual accomplishment for a creature that weighed about half a pound.\n\r\n“This was not a little tiny dessert fork—it was a dinner fork,” marvels Dani Jaworski, manager of architectural collections at the Colonial Williamsbu…",

          "description": "Just southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina, the ruins of a colonial open-pit iron ore mine are located on the hillsides of Nanny's Mountain. The mine was operational from approximately 1760 to 1820. Prior to the Revolutionary War, the iron mine fueled early industry in the area and was used to make pots, kettles, and other household items. During the war, the mine supplied ore for cannonballs, round shot, swords, cannons, and other weaponry.\n\r\nThe area around the mine saw several important Revolutionary War battles, including the pivotal battle of King’s Mountain, where American colonists soundly defeated British forces on October 7, 1780. It's possible that iron from this mine was used to make necessary supplies for the battle and may have made an important contribution to early American history. After the Revolution, some historians believe that this site was a stop on the Underground Railroad. \n\r\nThe mine pits can be viewed and explored along the short trail within the Nanny’s Mountain Historic Site Park. Pictures do not do justice to the size or depth of the pits. Keep in mind that these pits can be a safety hazard, so explore carefully.",

          "description": "As the Del Valle colonia (neighborhood) in Mexico City expanded in the 1960s, the small Catholic chapel that served this area became too small, so the local residents financed the construction of a larger building. Designed by architects Amaury Pérez de la Huerta García and Honorato Carrasco, work on the Parish of Divine Providence started in 1968, and was completed in 1974. In the midst of the Mexico City Summer Olympics, the city was caught up in a Modernist fervor, so many buildings designed at the time followed this architectural current.\n\r\nThis Parish's floorplan and appearance are somewhat like that of an open-hand fan, semicircular and defined by its 12 triangular panels that represent the 12 apostles of Christianity. Each of these features stained glass windows with geometric motifs in warm colors, a departure from the multicolored, figurative windows of many other places of worship. Another departure from traditional Catholic architecture, especially in Baroque-heavy Mexico, is its rather minimalistic interior.\n\r\nThe altar, located in the center of the semicircle, features a textured golden curved wall below a circular skylight which causes it to shine most of the day, with a cross hanging in front. The wall is framed by a pair of triangular structures featuring a wooden texture, making the interior relatively sober. The stadium-like seating surrounding the altar was designed as a result of a recent Vatican Council, which had determined that churches should strive to create a closer physical connection between altar and congregation.",

At first glance, it's nothing out of the ordinary, just an unassuming pavilion complimenting the garden, but it once stood on top of Qutub Minar.\n\r\nBuilt-in the early 13th century, the tower originally stood well over 300 feet tall and underwent several repairs throughout the ages. In 1803, its cupola was severely damaged in an earthquake, and Major Robert Smith of the British Indian Army sought to repair it. His pillared cupola was installed in 1828 as the sixth story of the tower but removed in 1848 as its architectural style was unfit for the ancient monument.\n\r\nThe cupola, dethroned and placed on the ground in the shadow of Qutub Minar, came to be known as Smith's Folly, as it simply serves no purpose. But perhaps it was a folly from the very beginning.",

Hojiblanca olives are utilized both for pickling and the production of olive oil. This particular tree originates from the Elche region in southern Spain.\n\r\nJeppa S Trädgård itself is a nine-acre botanical haven, featuring greenhouses representing various climatic zones, including tropical, Mediterranean, and a recently added subtropical greenhouse spanning more than 500 square yards.\n\r\nThe garden also houses a specialized plant shop offering a diverse selection of fruit trees from temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions. Visitors can enjoy refreshments, including coffee and ice cream, within the greenhouses.

As a Colonial stronghold of Spanish authority, the city was often targeted by piracy, some of it actively encouraged by rival European powers like the British and Dutch.\n\r\nWhile the Yucatán Peninsula is generally known for its flatness, the presence of two hills in Campeche made for the perfect locations for both forts, which saw most of their action throughout the 19th century. After the establishment of independent Mexico and the decline of piracy, they would both eventually become museums. For the Fort of San Miguel, its role as the local archaeology museum has been much longer-lived and unchanged. Since its establishment in 1986, the museum has focused on mainly showcasing Maya artifacts from sites in the state, such as Calakmul. The bulk of its collection, however, spread across 10 halls, is made up of Jaina-style figures.\n\r\nLocated within the modern-day Petenes-Ría Celestún Biosphere Reserve, Jaina Island is believed to have been artificially built during the Maya Classic period and inhabited between 600-1100. Jaina meaning: temple or house on the water, has become the namesake of a style of clay figurines found there and on its nearby mainland. The figurines are noted for their unique detailing, which has led to them being highlighted in this museum.",

The sculpture, known as one of the largest environmental sculptures in the Western Hemisphere, was built to adorn the local Highlands Business Park.

Called the cobra lily because their shape resembles an upright cobra, these plants lie in wait to strike at insects, their main source of nitrogen.  \n\r\nAt the first platform on the trail, you can see the bog in full bloom. At peak season, its full of hundreds of these gorgeous pitcher plants, some with bright flowers growing out. A few miles from the bog, the Smith River churns along. The area is full of a mineral called serpentine, which is gray-green in color and gives the Smith its brilliant blue-green color. The weathering of the serpentine produces magnesium, silica, and iron in the soil. It reduces the levels of calcium, potassium, and aluminum. To get the nitrogen and phosphorus that the plants need, they turn to a different source:  insects. \n\r\nThe pitcher plants have evolved to secrete nectar that attracts flies, ants, spiders, beetles, butterflies, and moths. They enter the plant and slide down into its long trumpet-shaped gullet, full of downward-facing hairs and slippery wall, becoming trapped at the bottom. There, the insect drowns and is slowly consumed by the plant. This is an extremely beautiful but extremely metal plant. \n\r\nSpeaking of metal, the area was extensively mined during and after the California Gold Rush. On the trail, you can also see a test mine shaft, probably dug to test for suitable minerals and metals to dig. They must not have found anything here, but the area has produced gold, chromite, and copper.",

Built to honor the ancestors and to assert their royal authority, many of the tombs consist of a huge burial mound and several temples.\n\r\nScattered over 18 locations across the Korean Peninsula, it’s not easy to see everything in one go, but one location has a huge cluster of royal tombs. Located in the city of Guri, right outside the perimeters of Seoul, is Donggureung: The Nine Eastern Royal Tombs.\n\r\nThe largest royal burial site in South Korea, Donggureung (also transliterated as Dongguneung) is home to the resting places of 17 kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty, originally founded by the order of King Taejong in 1408.\n\r\nThe “nine tombs” consist of Geonwonneung (King Taejo, 1408); Hyeonneung (King Munjong and Queen Hyeondeok, 1452); Mongneung (King Seonjo and Queens Uiin and Inmok, 1600); Sungneung (King Hyeonjong and Queen Myeongseong, 1674); Hwineung (Queen Jangnyeol, 1688); Hyeneung (Queen Danui, 1718); Wonneung (King Yeongjo and Queen Jeongsun, 1776); Gyeongneung (King Heonjong and Queens Hyohyeon and Hyojeong, 1849); and Suneung (King Ikjong and Queen Sinjeong, 1890).\n\r\nIn addition to these royal tombs, with their red pavilions, burial mounds, and funerary statues, the Donggureung complex also contains Myeongbinmyo (the grave of King Taejong’s concubine), the caretaker’s house, and a small museum. Surrounded by a serene forest and typically not as crowded as other historic attractions in and near Seoul, it’s quite a lovely place; one major shortcoming, perhaps, is that you can’t get close to the main parts of the tombs, as all the mounds are fenced at the foot.",

          "description": "San Diego is California's second-largest city by population and is proudly referred to as \"America's Finest City.\" It has a reputation for being in close proximity to Mexico and home to all branches of the United States armed forces. However, it is perhaps most well known for its 70 miles of beaches. \n\r\nUnless an avid and practiced sea diver, few visitors probably have little experience or knowledge of what is living in these watery depths. This is what makes the Map of the Grand Canyons La Jolla Shores so unique. Unveiled in October 2020, this 2,200 square-foot LithoMosaic not only depicts over 100 variety of species, (including aquatic varieties, as well as birds, mammals, and reptiles) but also the geological formations that can be found in and around this beachfront property.\n\r\nThe map was created to honor what would have been Walter Munk's 103rd birthday. Munk was an Austrian-born oceanographer who worked at the nearby Scripps Institute of Oceanography, as well as being a resident of La Jolla Shores. He was an avid proponent of understanding the effects climate change has on our environment, including the impacts on ocean temperatures. \n\r\nAlong with the Walter Munk Foundation for the Oceans, artist Robin Brailsford and her team of volunteers spent hundreds of hours mapping out and creating the massive display. Visitors are encouraged to walk on the art piece and discover the intricate details, as well as gain an understanding of what is taking place under the nearby waves. This includes 3-D models of reefs and the varying shades of blue tiles to indicate the various depths of the ocean floor.",

She was unable to move, and according to stories, the only object that she enjoyed was a tall dollhouse with clear windows that her father George had built for her. When Lova passed in 1908, she was buried and the dollhouse went with her to the grave, or so the story is told.\n\r\nSome news articles speculate the dollhouse was built specifically for the grave, which was not an entirely uncommon style for the region. Regardless, Lova’s father had requested the dollhouse be destroyed at the death of himself and Lova’s mother but the community rallied to disinter Lova and move the dollhouse to where she is now buried with her parents.",

The affordable prices (ranging from just £6.50 for breakfast to £13 for lunch and dinner), make it as much of a favorite among local office workers as the students lodging there. \n\r\nFavorites among patrons include chicken korma and biryani, while Thursdays are dedicated to South Indian dishes like sambar, a spicy lentil soup. Freshly prepared home-style curries (the Kerala fish curry, egg curry and butter chicken are popular options), tandooris, onion bhajis, and dhal offer a filling feast for the senses. Rice and condiments, as well as drinks such as coffee and Chaas, a refreshing herb-infused yogurt drink, are complimentary.\n\r\nThe canteen, located on the building’s ground-floor Mahatma Gandhi Hall, is a central hidden gem for many Londoners, situated near Fitzroy Square and just a three-minute walk from Warren Street Station. Established in 1920, the hostel is a hub for the young Indian diaspora community in London, and offers a rich culinary and cultural space for British Indian history. Thanks to the communal dining hall setup, where tables are often shared between groups of strangers, conversations with new folks are common, lending to a comfortable, almost family-like atmosphere. \n\r\nWhile YMCAs are historically Christian institutions, the Indian YMCA prides itself on being an interfaith organization that embraces and celebrates all communities. Residents and visitors alike appreciate the inclusive environment where shared experiences warmly bring people together—regardless of religion, language or cultural heritage.",

It was brought to Japan by a mission of monks returning from Tang, and its earliest cultivation was in 1191, when the Buddhist priest Myōan Eisai sewed tea seeds in the Iwakamibō gardens of Ryōzen-ji Temple, Saga, not far from the ancient settlement of Yoshinogari.\n\r\nInitially meant to be a medicinal plant, Japanese tea soon evolved into its own kind, with a culture of tea ceremonies developing over the years. Eisai's tea became what is known as matcha today. It was widely appreciated by Buddhists practicing zen, as they believed it improved one's body and spirit.\n\r\nOn the grounds of Shōfuku-ji Temple in Fukuoka, the oldest zen temple in Japan originally established by Eisai himself, stands a direct descendant of his tea trees, known as the \"Japan's First Tea Tree.\" A small, nondescript tree with lean branches at first glance, it may not be anything extraordinary, but its influence on traditional Japanese culture is irreplaceable.",

It’s nothing out of the ordinary, just a run-of-the-mill place with the usual menu. But on its façade and interior are autographs of Bong Joon-Ho, as well as the logo and delivery boxes of the fictional “Pizza Generation” restaurant from the film.\n\r\nParasite follows the tragicomedic lives of the poverty-stricken Kim family as they struggle to make ends meet, each member gradually infiltrating into the wealthier Park family, only for chaos to ensue. In one of the numerous low-income side jobs that the Kim family takes up, they fold delivery boxes for a local eatery: Pizza Generation. Later, the pizza place makes another appearance where the Kims are seen scheming on how to kick the housemaid out of the Park household.\n\r\nIn real life, Sky Pizza is a quiet family-run pizza joint. The owner will proudly offer visiting cinephiles the chance to take pictures with the Pizza Generation boxes, and bring you sketchbooks full of signatures and messages from Parasite-loving visitors from around the world, so that you can leave your own mark as well. Flipping through these pages, you'll see what a huge influence the film has had on a small local business like Sky Pizza.",

The acoustics in the theatre are second to none.\n\r\nThe Polk Theatre is not just a building made of bricks, but it is a place of great emotional significance to many. It is a cultural icon that has withstood the test of time and has been a source of joy for generations.

The popular myth claims that it was named after a local pregnant woman, Si, who sacrificed her own life to call upon an ancient guardian spirit to protect the city from an oncoming flood.\n\r\nAnother version of the story, perhaps resulting from mistranslation, has it that multiple pregnant women were sacrificed to prevent evil spirits from causing a disaster. Either way, the mythical Si Muang continues to be remembered and honored as a hero.\n\r\nThe temple itself houses a copy of the Emerald Buddha statue and a sacred stone pillar called the Lák Méuang, an ancient monument believed to enshrine the guardian spirit of the city, as well as several mini-shrines throughout the premises, some gorgeously kitsch. Right outside the temple also stands an imposing statue of King Sisavangvong, the first ruler of the Kingdom of Laos.",

If the native speakers of different languages, the thinking went, were able to communicate in a common tongue, they would understand each other better and consequently there would be less ethnic conflict.\n\r\nMany people invented languages with this dream in mind.

Everyone has their favorite, and for a lot of siu mei aficionados, that’s Sun Kwai Heung, a humble little take-out spot in the far eastern reaches of Hong Kong island. \n\r\nEverything is made on-site, from crispy-skinned roast pork to soy sauce chicken, to char siu, barbecued pork butt that is dipped in a gloriously sticky maltose glaze. The latter, in particular, is their specialty, and it’s not surprising to find a queue spilling out onto the sidewalk at certain hours of the day when it’s due to come out of the oven. \n\r\nYou can customize your order by letting the staff know how fatty you’d like the char siu to be – if you’re unsure, boon fei sau, which means “half-lean half-fat,” is a good place to start. Char siu—or any Cantonese barbecue, in fact—can be enjoyed on its own as a snack or appetizer, like charcuterie, or pair it with plain rice to make it a proper meal.",

Congee purveyors using this technique are few and far between these days, making them a rare gem—little wonder that the stall is busy even in summer, despite the lack of air conditioning. \n\r\nFresh fish belly is a specialty here, but you’ll find all the classic toppings like pork meatballs, sliced beef, pork innards. and century egg, as well as essential side dishes like savory Chinese doughnuts and steamed rice rolls.",

But before the land was purchased by the diocese in 1924, it was owned by Ronald Roy Conklin, a descendant of the original colonizers of Huntington and the owner of the North American Trust Company, which grew from a successful real estate partnership.\n\r\nConklin and his wife, the famous opera singer Mary McFadden, settled on what was then known as Rosemary Farm in 1913, living in a 30-room mansion overlooking Lloyd Harbor. Perhaps more fascinating though, is a treasure that lies just beyond the ruins of the home—an outdoor amphitheater built as a gift for McFadden.\n\r\nDesigned by Frederick Law Olmstead, of Central Park and Prospect Park fame, it hosted the National Red Cross Pageant in 1917, drawing thousands of guests and featuring a march led by John Philip Sousa. The amphitheater had an unusual design, with a moat in the center separating the audience and the performers on stage—quite the way to handle pesky hecklers!\n\r\nWhen the property was purchased by the diocese, the amphitheater fell into disuse, but has since been restored by the folks at the seminary. Few venture beyond the main building to explore the wonders in the backyard.",

          "description": "During construction works of the new Royal Collections Gallery, a set of ancient ruins was found. They include a section of the oldest Muslim wall, including several remains of houses attached and a pillar, part of the original gate of that primitive Madrid.\n\r\nThe wall was built in the late 9th century and made of large limestone ashlars, similar in technique to the nearby Tower of Bones and the Arab Wall. However, the remains found here are even older. Among these vestiges, it has been interpreted that a door of three meters (almost 10 feet) would correspond to that first gate of Madrid, the Puerta de la Sagra, (Xagra, in Arabic) very similar to the Puerta de Alcántara in Toledo. \n\r\nAll of these elements are linked to the origins of the foundation of Madrid by the Umayyad emir Muhammad I, in which the existence of a fortress in this place was justified because of its location. It bordered the Christian kingdoms of the north and sat on a high plateau protected by cliffs. \n\r\nAfter being hidden for centuries, the ruins have been incorporated into the permanent collection of the new museum and can be seen through a large glass. A video is projected in an adjoining room where the archaeological site is always in sight. The different parts of the old wall are illuminated. The exhibit shows the evolution of that ancient walled enclosure, first Muslim and then Christian, as well as the construction of the old Alcazar from the Habsburg dynasty to the current Royal Palace built on the Versailles style by the Bourbons in the 18th century.",

Along an inner road, a short distance away from St. Paul's Church near Pune Railway Station, in the center of the city, there is an empty patch of land along the side. In the corner of the plot are a number of interesting ancient stone structures. As one observes keenly, they are revealed to be old tombs. \n\r\nAccording to sources, these are European tombs from the 19th century. Historians, archaeologists, and other experts have studied them and have arrived at a number of possibilities regarding their origin and details. Some say these belonged to German soldiers from around 1850, while others are of the opinion that they date back to around 1817 and are of French soldiers who were said to be a part of the Peshwa Army. \n\r\nOne of the tombs is dome-shaped, supported with stone pillars. According to experts, it belonged to the wife of a French soldier. Along with soldiers, some of the tombs are also said to be those of local Europeans of that era. However, due to the withering of the plaques, it is difficult to ascertain the exact details with any degree of certainty. \n\r\nOne of the tombs has a tree growing vertically out of the stone slab. Another one has mysterious circular symbols carved over its sides. Then there is one which is completely covered with creepers while another has a gnarled tree trunk resting at an angle over its top. Since this place is along an inner road, not many people know of its existence, despite it being located in the center of the city. \n\r\nIt is a fascinating spot to explore on a weekend and thus discover this lesser-known side of the city’s history, particularly for people who have a penchant for mysteries.",

          "description": "Coimbra is one of the oldest cities in Portugal. Home to the most prestigious university in the country, it served as the first capital of the Kingdom of Portugal and has had a strong monastic presence ever since. Across the river from the main part of town stands the ruined Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha. Originally founded by Lady Mor in the late 13th century, it became a favorite of Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, who built her palace next door.\n\r\nThe monastery operated until the early 17th century, when flooding from the Mondego River forced the nuns to move uphill and leave the monastery. And there it sat for 300 years, until it was excavated in the late 20th century.\n\r\nSanta Clara-a-Velha is most famous for being the execution site for Ines de Castro. In 1340, King Afonso IV arranged the marriage between his son Pedro and Constanza Manuel of Castille. Much to Afonso's displeasure, Pedro fell madly in love with Constanza's cousin Ines, and installed her in Coimbra as his mistress. Constanza gave birth to a son and heir to the throne, but after she died in 1349, Pedro refused to marry any other woman except Ines.\n\r\nFearing her influence on Pedro and any future sons they might have, in 1355 Afonso had Ines murdered in the Santa Clara-a-Velha monastery. Pedro had her killers brutally executed, and when Afonso died and Pedro became king, the legend goes that he had Ines' body exhumed and coronated as Queen.\n\r\nToday, Pedro and Ines are buried together in nearby Alcobaca, but their story has become one of the most well-known tragedies in Portuguese history. As for the monastery itself, it still experiences flooding every now and then, but visitors are now able to access the lower floors of the old monastery, including the choir and old treasury. Santa Clara-a-Velha remains one of the most complete and historically important Gothic ruins in the entire country.",

Artists who performed at Top Deck included Donna Summer, Chubby Checker, Herman’s Hermits, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, Gloria Gaynor, Chaka Khan, the Village People, and Cheap Trick, among others.\n\r\nA more complete list of the performers is listed on the wall on the 1st floor of the Riviera building (which is open to the public and has several small shops open from spring to fall).\n\r\nThe ballroom recently underwent an extensive renovation and now is a popular venue for weddings and other private, special events.

The bridge has its own strange statues that help set the tone. Weekdays are calmer, allowing visitors to park closer to the building.\n\r\nDiscounted flea market finds await at every corner. And for the empty stalls, relics of old movie promotional posters, dusty homemade decorations, and strange dioramas keep things entertaining. There are two floors of indoor booths plus semi-permanent outdoor container booths and an ever-changing lineup of cars selling their wares in the drive-in theater’s wavy parking lot.\n\r\nSpeaking of cars, the building also seems to inexplicably host a collection of flashy collectible cars—though it has dwindled in size in recent years.\n\r\nAdded bonus: Steve-O used to be a clown here before the TV show Jackass made it big.",

Sadly this period of prosperity did not last. Following Henry VIII's set of 16th-century laws that worked to dissolve British monasteries, the site was largely abandoned and left to the elements.\n\r\nAnd yet, even as a ruin, the Monmouthshire site exudes a tranquil beauty befitting a monument that was once one of Wales’ great medieval buildings. Symmetrical stone arches still stand in a grand row, along with a few turret-topped stone towers, providing a sense of the scale of the original priory. So picturesque are the weathered remains that famed British artist J.M.W. Turner traveled here to paint them in 1794 (a watercolor that now hangs in the Tate Britain in London).\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there’s the pub. Hidden beneath the 900-year-old site, in what is thought to have once been the abbey’s cellar, is a wonderfully cozy undercroft bar, where in-the-know patrons duck down into a cave-like space to sample the selection of local ales on tap.\n\r\nThe old-worldly drinking den is run by the Llanthony Priory Hotel, which is attached to the site. The hotel has been set up to retain a sense of the abbey’s original role as a retreat from the modern world, and, as such, offers no in-room TVs, no wifi, and not even any mobile phone signal.\n\r\nAlong with drawing hikers, history buffs, and quirky pub enthusiasts, the area is also famed for its stargazing credentials, offering exceptionally clear views of the cosmos after dark.",

          "description": "If you think riding a bicycle is exciting, imagine racing 40 miles an hour along steep curves without extra gears or brakes to stop you. This scene happens frequently at the Dick Lane Velodrome, Atlanta’s official home of track cycling. While this velodrome is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary, many Atlantans are unfamiliar with this hidden gem.\n\r\nThe Dick Lane Velodrome is located just eight miles south of downtown Atlanta, in East Point’s Sumner Park. Residents of East Point were inspired to create a velodrome after watching the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The group saw the racers on the Radstadion Velodrome in Olympiapark and decided they needed their own track. (\n\r\nThe course was completed in November 1974 at a cost of about $200,000. Some of the funds came from the Federal Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, the East Point Recreation Department, the State of Georgia, local civic groups, and East Point residents. Dick Lane, the namesake of the Dick Lane Velodrome, was a major fundraiser for the track. Lane was the Director of the East Point Recreation Department and a member of the Georgia State Legislature.\n\r\nThe Dick Lane Velodrome is a 1/5-mile track with 36-degree banked turns. In addition to the track and judges’ stand, it has a parking area, concession building, public seating, a picnic area, and restrooms. The track also offers equipment rentals. It is the only velodrome in the world with a green space containing a large oak tree and a creek running through the infield.\n\r\nThe East Point Velodrome Association, the non-profit group that manages and maintains the track, hosts a number of events throughout the year. Highlights include: Bicycle Safety Clinics, Beginner’s Program, Youth Cycling League, Advanced Training, Weekly Racing, and Pro Racing Series.\n\r\nThere are about two dozen active velodromes in the United States. The closest tracks to the Dick Lane Velodrome are in Ashville, North Carolina, Rock Hill, South Carolina, and Cooper City, Florida.",

Although these giant herbivores were once pushed to the brink of extinction by the United States government, careful conservation efforts have helped stabilize populations.\n\r\nThis particular herd consists of around 250 animals, which roam free over 400 acres designed to simulate their natural habitat. Unlike a zoo, this gives visitors the chance to see these charismatic megafauna behave much as they would in the wild. The best time to visit is in mid-May, when around 40 to 50 calves are born each year.\n\r\nIn addition to learning about the bison, visitors can learn more about the history of the Native Americans prior to the arrival of European colonists. There is also a gift shop with souvenirs, as well as bison meat and snacks for purchase.",

These dinosaurs aren’t millions of years old and never took a gulp of air. They’re dapper Victorians, made of cement, wire, stone, and clay. They were entertainers and educators, meant to give New Yorkers their first glimpse of the prehistoric creatures that once roamed New Jersey forests and Connecticut lakeshores. But in 1871, these carefully crafted, life-size models were destroyed, smashed into worthless smithereens, and then buried in a small mound in Central Park. According to historian Vicky Coules of the University of Bristol, the event remains the “greatest act of vandalism in the history of dinosaur study and museum development.”\n…",

In the flush of harvest, homes of the local Sahariya people overflowed with goods gathered from the forest, notably chir: a fragrant, green-yellow resin, also known as Indian frankincense, that comes from the salai tree.\n\r\nKabra expected to visit Kuno just a couple times, but the place got under her skin, she says.

The crown jewel is the collection of King Oscar II, considered by many to be the world's first open-air museum. First set up at the monarch's summer residence in 1881, the original five buildings included a 16th-century farmhouse and a 12th-century storehouse.\n\r\nMost impressive of all is the Stave Church from Gol, a magnificent wooden cathedral first built around 1200 and partially rebuilt and restored in 1880. Intricate carvings cover the richly detailed interior.\n\r\nAlthough the church was once filled with brightly painted statues of Catholic saints, today all that remains are the places where the figures once stood and occasional cryptic runes. The nave of the church still reads “Kiss me, because I struggle,” possibly in reference to one of the lost sculptures.",

Gates were crucial to ensure movement in and out of the city which explains why Madrid is still today a city of gates.\n\r\nMany of the gates once located around Madrid were demolished. Some still remain, while others have given their name to the place where they were once located. \n\r\nPuerta del Sol (Sun Gate) is actually a square and not a gate, but it owes its name to a long-gone gate that was decorated with a sun and was known to locals as \"La Puerta del Sol.\"\n\r\nThere are two possibilities for the origin of the name Puerta del Sol for the square. One of them according to municipal records states that the square got its name from a sun-decorated medieval wall shutter that was destroyed in the 17th century. The other theory is that a gate was built with the sun's rising direction in mind—to the east.\n\r\nThe square has undergone many refurbishments, but this symbol remains as a nod to the past.",

          "description": "In Karen, a leafy suburb of Nairobi, chef Dennis Ang’ani whips up a unique fusion experience for just 12 visitors per seating on a greenery-laden cabin terrace. The multi-course dining concept is primarily inspired by local produce and traditional East African recipes done up with culinary techniques picked up by Ang’ani abroad.\n\r\nRoot and vine vegetables are freshly plucked from Embark’s own gardens. Ingredients are showcased using European techniques, from foams to fermentation, with elaborate presentations, and occasional garnishes of flowers plucked from Nairobi’s Physic Garden.\n\r\nExpect a walk on the earthy side: a chilled banana and rum soup with a garden salad in Bailey’s and macadamia nut vinaigrette, seared tofu in Ethiopian shiro (a spicy chickpea sauce), or mini plantain burgers. Vegetable-based desserts often tread into especially wild, savory territory; from Amarula-braised eggplant with aerated broccoli ice cream, to ugali (corn maize) with creamed spinach.\n\r\nAll in all, the menu reflects Ang’ani’s multicultural experiences. After growing up in a German-Kenyan household, he moved around Europe working in kitchens from the Baltics to Barcelona, and fluently speaks German, English, Swahili, and Spanish.\n\r\nThough as a child he dreamed of becoming a pro soccer player in Europe, he maintains that bringing an innovative approach to the African fine-dining scene has been a more fulfilling challenge for him than any league could be; and even requires similar skills like dexterity, teamwork and performance under pressure. \n\r\nA picture of Coach Pep Guardiola, one of Ang’ani’s heroes, hanging from a wall-mounted handwoven basket, helps him to remember the importance of being a good leader and most importantly, to never be limited by conventionality and cultural borders.",

This mixture got its name because looked like a deadly form of porridge.\n\r\nPrior to the building of HM Grenta, this location was quiet, with only a few farms and villages in the area. Then World War I began. In just 12 months, the government acquired the land and built a massive factory. The HM Gretna site was huge, it covered a distance of nine miles, stretching down to England.\n\r\nThere were 30,000 workers, 12,000 of whom were women. Lots of the munitions girls moved to the area, especially to work at the factory, moving from areas like Durham, Darlington, and Sunderland. The chemicals were highly toxic, the girls' skin would turn yellow and they often lost all of their teeth. The contribution to the war effort made by the munitions girls here at HM Gretna helped women achieve the vote in the United Kingdom.\n\r\nBy 1917, the factory was producing 1,100 tons of cordite a week. This was significantly more than all the other munitions factories in Britain put together. This explosive was then shipped out to the troops on the front line.\n\r\nThe museum has a special version of a train, a fireless locomotive, designed to safely transport the explosive on display in the grounds. The museum tells the story of the girls who worked here and the Irish navvies who built the massive factory.\n\r\nIt also covers a horrific troop train crash at Quintinshill. While the second floor is dedicated to WWII. With a small section covering nuclear power and the local nuclear power station.",

However, upon entering the Liberty Hotel, one realizes this was no ordinary building but rather once a jail that was in operation for more than a century.\n\r\nOriginally known as the Charles Street Jail or  Suffolk County Jail, it's located on the west end of the city overlooking the Charles River. It was constructed between 1848-1851 and proposed by Mayor Martin Brimmer during his inaugural address of 1843 as a replacement for the older Leverett Street Jail.\n\r\nThe original jail was built using Quincy granite with four wings extending from a central octagonal rotunda and housed around 220 cells. The prisoners were segregated by sex and nature of offense with 30 arched windows providing ventilation and natural light.\n\r\nThroughout its years of operation, it housed a wide range of inmates from mob hitmen to a former governor. In 1973, the United States District Court ruled that due to overcrowding and neglected conditions, the constitutional rights of the inmates were being violated and the jail closed in 1990. It reopened in 2007 as the Liberty Hotel with much of the historic architecture still preserved.",

One of those few occasions was when he accepted the chance to work on this palace in Astorga, León.\n\r\nBishop Joan Baptista Grau I Vallespinós decided to entrust the construction of the new episcopal palace to his friend Gaudí, who just like the bishop, came from Reus, Tarragona. Gaudí's imaginative touch is evident in the innovative use of materials, incorporating iron, brick, and ceramics alongside traditional stone.\n\r\nGaudí made a significant mark on the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, Spain, with his distinctive architectural style. The palace, constructed between 1889 and 1915, stands as a brilliant fusion of various influences, showcasing Gaudí's innovative ideas and artistic vision.\n\r\nThe most striking feature of Gaudí's intervention in the palace is the facade. Adorned with a combination of organic and geometric motifs, it reflects his fascination with nature and its organic forms. The building's interiors also bear Gaudí's creative flair, with unique decorative elements and functional yet aesthetically pleasing spaces.\n\r\nGaudí's work on the Episcopal Palace in Astorga exemplifies his ability to transform existing architectural designs into masterpieces that harmoniously blend traditional and avant-garde styles. The building stands today as a testament to Gaudí's genius, drawing visitors from around the world to marvel at its beauty and architectural significance.",

This small act of kindness has been appreciated by hundreds of bees—and warmed the hearts of thousands.\n\r\nThe honeybee drinking fountain was first created in 2016, but it did not reappear for the next four years due to the lack of apian visitors during that time. Attached to the ablution pavilion, the fountain’s platform is made from bamboo and stuffed with moss, which provides a footing for the bees and creates the feeling of a serene fairytale scene.\n\r\nThe small sign standing on the drinking fountain reads “a drinking spot reserved for groups of honeybees,” but paper wasps are also often seen drinking water from it. They do not only drink water to cool themselves down, but also carry it back to their hives to keep the temperature comfortable so that the babies are not harmed by the summer heat.",

          "description": "Although nobody can guarantee whether the remains of Ibn Battuta are really kept inside this impressive white mausoleum, this is perhaps the closest one can get to one of the greatest explorers in history.\n\r\nIbn Battuta, the famous Moroccan explorer, and traveler, is widely regarded as one of the greatest travelers in history. He embarked on a remarkable journey in the 14th century that took him through Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and beyond, covering a distance believed to be over 75,000 miles.\n\r\nBattuta was born in Tangier in 1304 and set out on his travels at the age of 21. His adventures spanned nearly three decades, during which he explored various regions, experienced different cultures, and met numerous rulers and dignitaries.\n\r\nHis written account, known as the Rihla, provides invaluable insights into the medieval world, shedding light on the diverse cultures, customs, and political landscapes of the places he visited. Battuta's travelogue serves as a significant historical source, capturing the socio-economic conditions, religious practices, and intercultural exchanges of the time, making it an indispensable resource for scholars and a captivating literary work that continues to inspire wanderlust and cultural curiosity.\n\r\nThere are plenty of historical markers or memorials related to Battuta in the city, given his significant contribution to Moroccan and world history. As a prominent figure, he is also celebrated throughout Morocco and the broader Muslim world for his travel accounts and contributions to geographical knowledge.",

Ranging from different time periods, denominations, and congregations, churches across America have been a defining feature throughout the nation's history. Although many churches have a unique history, there is one church in Framingham that has a particularly notable distinction as being the first public performance and singing of the Battle Hymn of the Republic.\n\r\nThe church was founded in 1701 and by the time of the American Civil War, it was called the Hollis Evangelical Congregational Church. On the evening of February 22, 1862, the residents of Framingham gathered in the church to celebrate the 130th anniversary of George Washington's birthday and read aloud his 1796 farewell address as encouraged by President Lincoln via national proclamation three days earlier. The speech was read by Norman School principal George Bigelow and the program was concluded with the singing of Battle Hymn of the Republic by Julia Ward Howe which was published in The Atlantic Monthly that same month. \n\r\nThe song became extremely renowned in the United States with its abolitionist and religious themes resonating strongly with supporters of the Union cause during the American Civil War. It was one of the most popular songs among Union troops and became a staple of United States military music. Today, it's considered a classic patriotic song with many renditions, tributes, and parodies.",

Both within and around the city, there are several lush green hills where visitors can find historic forts, temples, monuments, and caves.\n\r\nARAI Hill, also known as Vetal Hill, is the highest point in the city at an elevation of over 2,000 feet. The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) is located here. A temple of Vetal and a few other temples are also located on the hill. A short distance from ARAI and the temples is a large abandoned stone quarry that has formed a lake.\n\r\nThe quarry is a paradise for nature lovers. Every morning and evening, people visit the hill for walking, jogging, photography, bird watching, yoga, meditation, exploring nature, and watching the city from one of its highest points. The hill is accessible from multiple areas, as there are walking trails from all sides. All the trails converge towards the center at the top, where the stone quarry lake is located.\n\r\nSome portions of the hill are covered with dense trees, while others are grasslands. The quarry lake, with its marshy areas and shallow waters, has created a wetland with an ecosystem of its own. One can spot several rare and exotic bird species here.\n\r\nThe hill is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The views offered from here are breathtaking. One can see the city stretching into the distance where there are more hills at the horizon.",

          "description": "King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia presided over the inauguration of the Queen Victoria Bridge on June 13, 1909. The bridge was named in honor of the king's wife. It connects Bombilla Park, the two hermitages of San Antonio de la Florida, with the Colonia de San Antonio de La Florida and the Colonia del Manzanares.\n\r\nBased on a design by architect Julio Martnez-Zapata Rodriguez, it was built by engineer José Eugenio Ribera Dutaste. The bridge includes two, parallel elliptical reinforced concrete arches that are decorated in modernist style. It also has two lanes for cars. Additionally, Queen Victoria Bridge is one of Spain's earliest concrete bridges. Four vases and eight cast-iron lampposts decorated by Francisco Iglesias with bears serve as its adornment.\n\r\nDuring the Second Spanish Republic, the bridge changed its name to Puente de Galicia. After the Spanish Civil War, it recovered its original name. On one of its sides, visitors can see a commemorative plaque placed on June 13, 1999, to celebrate its 19th anniversary.\n\r\nIts ornamental components, which are mostly concentrated on the board, reflect the modernist trends of the day. Four vases and eight iron lampposts (two and four at each end) are placed on it, at the base of which different rampant bears appear, in a clear reference to the heraldic shield of Madrid.",

William Moore and his wife Agnes were an important part of society in Norman. The house was later sold to Agnes’ niece and her husband, Harry, and Daisy Lindsay.\n\r\nThe remnants of Daisy Lindsay’s locally famous rose garden can still be seen on the property next door. In the 1960s, the family sold the house and it was divided into apartments. They didn’t last long, however, before the building was condemned. The city of Norman saved the house and opened it as a museum in the 1970s. \n\r\nThe museum is now furnished as an example of the typical Oklahoma Victorian house. The house contains artifacts from around Cleveland County, including a woman’s side-saddle ridden by Martha Giles in the Land Run of 1889.        \n\r\nThe museum hosts frequent events for both adults and children, including tea parties, soap-making, embroidery classes, children’s camps, and even paranormal investigations.",

When this plaza was being built, a large stone ring with a figure carved on it was unearthed. This was a tlachtemalácatl, the name in Náhuatl (the language of the Aztec/Mexica people) for the \"goals\" of the Mesoamerican Ballgame. Known as tlachtli, variants of this game were played by the Indigenous peoples of most of Mexico and Central America, almost always with ritualistic and symbolic purposes.\n\r\nThis particular malacatl of the tlachtli game was so well-carved that it was kept after being found, and eventually placed in a prominent position in the Jesús Reyes Heroles House of Culture, in what is now the Mexico City borough of Coyoacán. This cultural center was once an actual house, and its late 18th-century architecture shows it. It also functioned as a paper factory for some time, and in 1985, was established as a House of Culture.\n\r\nIts namesake, Jesús Reyes Heroles, was a significant 20th-century intellectual who delved into law, politics, and history. Usually advocating in favor of democratic values and human rights, his legacy led to many institutions other than this center being named after him.",

That is what happened to Real de Catorce in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí when its silver ran dry in the early 20th century. But it was never completely abandoned. \n\r\nThe land around the town, particularly the desert below, is known as Wirikuta, the sacred land of the Huichol people. Real de Catorce has long been a pilgrimage site for them due to its proximity to Wirikuta. It's also a place of pilgrimage for Roman Catholics. The Parish of Immaculate Conception Cathedral draws visitors hoping to ask a favor from Saint Frances Assisi.\n\r\nToday, the town sees pilgrims of a different sort, namely tourists in search of the magic that keeps visitors coming to this out-of-the-way location. When silver mining ended over a century ago, the town's population dropped down to the hundreds. Today the town has around a thousand permanent residents. The sizable tourist flow keeps its small hotels busy. \n\r\nMuch of the town is abandoned. Be sure to visit the historic bullfighting ring and its amphitheater. A hike up to the hills will give you a panoramic view of the town and its surroundings. Throughout the town, the Huichol sell their intricate, colorful artwork.",

He had founded Sakata Seed Corporation in 1913, growing it from a small purveyor of lily bulbs into a major multinational developer of flower, fruit, and vegetable varieties. Today, the spaghetti squash can be counted among Sakata’s many successes; but it was far from an overnight one.\n\r\nSince the 1930s, Sakata had been the exclusive marketer of spaghetti squash in the United States.

          "description": "The commune and spa town of Bagnères-de-Luchon is situated in the picturesque valleys and hills of southwestern France. Nestled close to the Spanish border, the town sits among the foothills of the French Pyrenees and is renowned for its thermal springs. For centuries, especially in the Victorian period, attracted people in poor health looking to convalesce in a scenic setting. One can easily imagine bourgeois visitors coming to Luchon to bask in therapeutic waters, perhaps as they cough discretely into a bloodstained lace handkerchief.\n\r\nToday, Luchon's tourists enjoy the benefits of the waters sans illnesses. Modern upgrades to the Thermes buildings demonstrate that Luchon's restorative springs remain as popular as ever with visitors.\n\r\nThe local architecture is a curious mix of Belle Epoque grandeur and Tyrolean ski resort, unsurprising, given that the town also caters to skiers and snowboarders who venture into the snow-capped mountains every winter. The town remains a beautiful spot to enjoy a coffee at a boulevard cafe while admiring the majestic mountain range that dominates the town's skyline.\n\r\nThese breathtaking peaks also captivated the writer, poet, and playwright Edmond Rostand who spent many summers enjoying the unique pleasures of Luchon while residing at Villa Julia, a holiday home built by the Rostand family. Here, Edmond composed love letters and wrote his most famous literary work, Cyrano De Bergerac.   \n\r\nA commemorative bust was erected in 1922, four years after Rostand's death at the age of 50. The statue features his curly mustache and an unmistakable creative air as the statue looks wistfully into the middle distance seeking inspiration. Appropriately the bust sits where his effigy can view the mountains, the river Pique, and Villa Julia.  \n\r\nIt's a discrete but fitting tribute to a man known as France's National Poet who gave the world one of its most famous literary characters and who found vast reserves of inspiration in the splendor of the Pyrenees and the charming spa town of Luchon.",

          "description": "Grandma’s cake and chit-chat—that’s the concept behind the lovable Munich café and bakery Kuchentratsch (in German, ‘cake gossip’).\n\r\nLocated in the heart of the Bavarian capital, this sweet haven has perfected the typical German tradition of Kaffee und Kuchen-Zeit (afternoon coffee and cake time) and put it toward a good cause. The establishment doubles as a social initiative startup where all fresh-baked confections are made by local elderly folks.\n\r\nFounded in 2014, Kuchentratsch serves some of the city’s best traditional German cakes. Depending on the season, and who’s aproned-up that day, a delectable selection may include anything from rhubarb torte to crumb cake (Streuselkuchen) to marble cake (Marmorkuchen). Cakes are displayed in a glass vitrine next to the name of the Oma or Opa (grandma or grandpa) who made them.\n\r\nCakes are delivered Germany-wide but for sit-in guests, the bakery provides cozy tables in an inviting interior. Think: large glass windows are adorned with plush armchairs against a strawberry-pink ceiling. Throughout the day, elderly folks bake in an open kitchen and socialize around tables, gabbing while waiting on their oven timers. Pensioners work part-time at Kuchentratsch, and many spend their retirement time getting together here, even when they’re not on duty for the dough.\n\r\nThe wafting aromas of warm treats and happy banter contribute to the ambience that owners Katharina Mayer and Katrin Blaschke always wanted: an interactive “experience bakery” spanning tastes and generations. Along with frequent baking workshops, Kuchentratsch aims to support the elderly with a fun hobby that provides purpose, prevents loneliness and supplements pensions with extra pocket money.\n\r\nSo, whether you go for the poppy seed crumble or a chocolate cake made especially for the vegan crowd, rest assured that, as the German saying also goes in English, “the way to one’s heart is always through the stomach.”",

          "description": "Taiwan, an island, cherishes seafood as a culinary staple. For generations, seafood soups and congee used to dominate the breakfast tables and early morning street food stall menus, until they were slowly phased out for more popular wheat-based dishes like scallion pancakes and egg crepes. Emmanuel is one of the few exceptions and has been whipping up comforting bowls of hot tilapia soup for hungry customers in the morning since 1977. \n\r\nFor decades, the place was an old road side stall servicing blue-collar workers. But in 2021, the third-generation owner convinced his parents to take over and give the brand a 21st-century face-lift. They’ve since relocated to a cozy brick-and-mortar space with indoor seating and air conditioning. \n\r\nDespite the refresh, the menu and the prices have stayed exactly the same: whole slabs of fish sourced fresh from the market daily are served in soup, usually paired with a hearty serving of stir-fried rice vermicelli with a heaping of braised ground pork, crunchy bean sprouts, and housemade chili sauce. Every fish is carefully skinned and gutted and served whole—with the head, eyes, and fins still intact. \n\r\nWhile the menu is small, there is something for everyone on it. If fish isn’t your thing, they do a classic egg drop soup or one topped with hearty slices of pork.The best part? The prices for each dish has stayed well under 100 NTD ($3 USD).",

Stocked with movie paraphernalia and books, it is the brainchild of Taiwanese director Wei Te-sheng, whose Cape No. 7 was Taiwan's second highest-grossing movie of all time and achieved the longest theatrical release in the island’s cinematic history. \n\r\nThe food is typical cafe fare: coffees, teas, sandwiches, waffles. For something more substantial, they do a decent barbecued pork, sliced into thin pieces, paired with a sunny side-up egg and served over rice. There are grilled rice balls and bright salads. Even local craft beer if one is so inclined. \n\r\nHowever, the food is secondary because the main draw at Real Guts is the decor. There are old film cameras, director clapboards from Wei’s movie sets, and two real Golden Horse awards (considered the Oscars of Chinese-language cinema) on display. There’s also an entire bookshelf brimming with storyboards and set design drafts, plus a merchandise section selling miscellanea like T-shirts of endemic Taiwanese animals. \n\r\nWhile it’s all a bit chaotic, Real Guts draws a consistent crowd of work-from-home folks and students, who like the floor-to-ceiling windows and lush foliage that hangs from the nooks and crannies of the space. Stocked with a reasonable amount of outlets and Wi-Fi, it is a relaxing place to pull up a laptop and get some work done.",

Spoiler alert: It’s the bowhead whale. (There are a few other, non-mammalian creatures that have them beat: a deep-dwelling shark, a clam, a jellyfish that just doesn’t die at all.)

          "description": "For first-timers, a trip to Taiwan isn’t complete without a hearty bowl of beef noodle soup. A dish unique to the island, it was invented in the mid-20th century by refugees who had left the Chinese mainland for Taiwan during the Chinese civil war. Today, it’s become somewhat of the national dish of Taiwan. But with over 10,000 dedicated beef noodle soup shops on the island, narrowing down the options is a harrowing task. \n\r\nChef Hung Beef Noodle Soup is a great place to start. The eponymous owner Hung Ching-Lung is a five-time award-winning champion of the annual beef noodle soup competition in Taiwan—the most decorated winner in the event’s history. \n\r\nThe restaurant’s menu offers a diverse overview of the beef noodle soup options on the island, from a classic star-anise-heavy broth flavored with spicy bean paste to a minimally seasoned clear broth where delicate slices of beef are highlighted. A couple of Hung’s award-winning bowls are on the menu as well: there’s one topped with tripe, tendon, and shank and another with medium rare, paper-thin slices of beef overlaid on top. \n\r\nFor Chef Hung, beef noodle soup is much more than just a profession. It’s a passion. He has a cattle farm on the outlying island of Kinmen, where he raises his own cows for the restaurants. And he’s often tasked with training up-and-coming chefs on how to make a fantastic beef broth for their restaurants. He says the key is procuring a really high-quality cut of beef and making a flavorful broth. Everything else is just secondary.",

          "description": "The church of St. George the Martyr is the oldest Anglican church in Southeast Asia. Before the church was built, religious services in Penang were conducted at Fort Cornwallis and later at the courthouse in George Town, a short distance away. Plans for a church were submitted as early as 1810 but it wasn’t until the East India Company Act of 1813 gave the British East India Company authority that the church was built. It was constructed in 1818 and consecrated in 1819 costing some 60,000 Spanish dollars (also known as \"pieces of eight\").\n\r\nThe first significant event that took place in the church after its completion was the wedding of Governor William Edward Philips to Janet Bannerman, the daughter of his predecessor, Colonel John Alexander Bannerman on June 30, 1818.\n\r\nOn the grounds stands a memorial to Francis Light, a British explorer and the founder of the British colony of Penang and its capital city George Town in 1786. Interestingly, he is also the father of William Light, who founded the city of Adelaide in Australia.\n\r\nThe church was first restored after being looted and badly damaged during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia in the Second World War. It was restored again in 2011 after being designated a National Heritage in 2007.",

Keeping with the theme, the shelves are stocked with magazines crammed with centerfolds of busty, scantily clad women.  \n\r\nThe aesthetic of Pure Love is a nod to the “grandpa shops” of Taipei—old-school karaoke rooms where older men are known to seek the company and services of flirtatious waitresses. Big in the ‘60s and up to the ‘80s, they have since waned considerably in popularity after a crackdown in prostitution in the ‘90s.  \n\r\nPure Love Snack Bar is a modern revival of the grandpa shop, but without any of the shady or illegal dealings. The food is unpretentious and rooted in Taiwanese classics like braised pork over rice, oyster soup, fried chicken, and deep-fried noodles smothered in an earthy satay sauce. The drinks are more elevated and utilize locally available flavors like guava, tieguanyin tea, and mulberry.",

The term “tea house” is a misnomer; Jinjiang is a full-service restaurant dedicated to Hakka cuisine—the fare of a Han Chinese subgroup known for its emphasis on salty and smoked meats and a love of pickles. \n\r\nSituated in an 80-something-year-old house dating back to the Japanese colonial occupation of Taiwan, the restaurant is a quaint cottage in a forest of skyscrapers. The inside is just as charming, with outdated white ceiling tiles, wooden tables, and shelves stuffed with cute knick-knacks and miscellaneous clutter. \n\r\nThe food is as wholesome as the decor. They do cold poached chicken—the skin crisp and gelatinous—served with a kumquat dipping sauce. There’s a lovely salted pork, sliced into bite-sized pieces, which pairs especially well with a hot bowl of short-grain rice dressed with soy  sauce-flavored lard.\n\r\nThe tender shoots of bird’s nest ferns are sauteed with the pickled seeds of a bird lime tree. There’s slippery noodles made with green tea, and thick belts of rice noodles with minced pork. Dessert is complimentary—usually a bowl of grass jelly, a mint-like herb beloved among the Hakka in Taiwan, or small mochi balls dressed with sweet ground peanuts. \n\r\nFor the full experience, finish off with lei cha, a ground tea made with pounded grains. It’s akin to matcha, but less vegetal and more toasted and nutty.",

          "description": "Some 1,000 years ago, the Normans pushed north attempting to subjugate part of Westmorland. As part of this effort, Castle Howe was built. Kendal’s undisputed first castle, Castle Howe, was built in 1092 and overlooks the town.\n\r\nThe fortifications consist of a well-defined motte, rising to around 33 feet and measuring around 59 feet in diameter at the summit. The base of the motte measures around 150 feet, and is surrounded by ditches and embankments. The bailey lays to the east of the motte, and is roughly triangular in shape, and was turned into a bowling green and is now a public park.\n\r\nThe Barony of Kendal fell at the hands of Ivo de Taillebois around 1092 and as a reward for his unfailing military support and success, Ivo was granted the Barony of Kentdale, a title that brought with it huge swathes of land in what is now Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria.\n\r\nKendal Castle, to the east of the earthworks, was probably built while Castle Howe was still being used. Likely, Castle Howe was the baronial center of Kirkland, and Kendal Castle was the baronial center of Kentdale. Castle Howe eventually became redundant, as did the Kendal Castle, and the administrative center of Kendal moved to the Moot Hall in the center of town.\n\r\nIn 1788, to celebrate the centenary of the revolution of 1688, an obelisk was erected on the summit of Castle Howe. The monument was designed by architect Francis Webster who was a native of Kendal.",

The district of Hansaviertel was a rich urban neighborhood, and quite desirable thanks to its proximity to the city center while being right next to Tiergarten Park. But after the Second World War, it was almost completely leveled.\n\r\nEast Berlin had been rebuilding over the 50s, courtesy of its new socialist government and the West didn’t want to be left behind. To show that they were a new free and capitalist society, they also decided to rebuild, and the destroyed district of Hansaviertel proved to be an ideal location.\n\r\nMore than 50 architects were invited to work on the project, German and international alike. There were some famous names in the group, including Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer, the designer of the new Brazilian capital. Each presented their own future vision of housing.\n\r\nThe district contains a school, a kindergarten, a shopping center with a library and a theatre, and even an academy of arts. Additionally, every house has some special spin. They usually have descriptions on the ground floor somewhere, though a guide can be bought at the shopping center at a club made for this district",

In Miyakojima, the local traffic safety association tried a slightly new way back in the 1990s, when five policemen-like figurines were set up at various crossings around the island. These were known as Mamoru-kun patrolmen. \n\r\nAs the story goes, Mamoru-kun was born on August 5, 1991. He stands 180 centimeters tall, and his official titles are \"Miyakojima Safety Association Staff\" and \"Miyakojima Police Transportation Division Officer.\"\n\r\nOver the years there have been more figurines set up all over the island. Currently you can find 20 Mamoru-kun in various places in Miyakojima. Nineteen of these patrolmen are male, but at the Miyakojima Police Station, you can also find his female colleague Maruko-chan.\n\r\nThanks to their loyal service in all weather conditions, Mamoru-kun was also given a special Miyakojima residence permit by Mayor Toshihiko Shimoji in a ceremony back in 2012.\n\r\nOriginally these figurines were considered kimo (creepy), but recently Mamoru-kun have got their own fanbase. With their popularity rising, you can now also find Mamoru-kun cookies, soft drinks, and more.",

          "description": "Rather than driving through a tunnel beneath the Alps, this pass offers unparalleled views as you traverse over the mountains. The scenic route connects Val-Cenis in Western France with Susa in Italy, and was one of the most well-traveled paths through the Alps during the Middle Ages. The road will take a few hours to traverse, but the views and sights along the way are well worth it. \n\r\nSome scholars believe that this is the exact pass that Hannibal took with his army and war elephants in 218 BC. More than a millennia later, in 1414, Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara took this route back to Italy after meeting Charles VI in Paris. Niccolò described the pass as having \"a good ascent and bad descent.\" Pilgrims have also taken this route on the way to Rome and the Vatican for centuries.\n\r\nEventually, Napoleon built a road on the old pilgrimage trail sometime in the early 19th century. In 1871, a railroad tunnel known as Frejus Tunnel was constructed some 30 miles away. The tunnel connected Mondane, France with Bardonecchia, Italy. It was one of the first tunnels of its kind and exhibited a remarkable feat of engineering for the time. Today, the tunnel is still one of the largest railroad tunnels in the world measuring some eight miles long. The road is also has been used as part of the Tour de France.\n\r\nAt the top of the pass, alongside an icy blue lake known as Lac du Mont Cenis, statues of Hannibal's elephants line the trail. The building of a dam created the artificial lake in 1921. The dam, today, feeds two hydroelectric power plants. The lake occasionally empties for maintenance. \n\r\nAt the top of the pass, as you look out over the lake, you'll find a very quirky chapel. Built in 1967, the chapel is shaped like a pyramid and is made of concrete. Today it also houses a museum about the history of this region and is one of the highest museums in Europe. Other nearby sights include a botanical garden and multiple fortifications.",

Laurel Kratochvila’s bagel journey dates back to 1897 when her great-great grandfather, Hyman Cooper, declared that he was moving to New York City for one simple reason: “The bagels are better.” Although he ended up in Boston, running a fix-it shop, his declaration set the stage for four generations of bagel devotion within the family.\n\r\nWhat began as a small addition to the English-language bookstore Shakespeare and Sons has become a destination in its own right. Laurel brought her family recipes to Berlin, recreating the authentic homemade bagels she missed from her New York roots. Her partner, Roman, who owns other bookstores in the Czech Republic and worked at the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, complements the culinary experience with an extensive collection of English and some French books.\n\r\nBagels are hand-rolled daily in small batches. Overnight proofing, rapid boiling, and hot baking process lend to an old-fashioned flavor across varieties from poppyseed to cinnamon raisin and rosemary sea salt. A variety of homemade schmears and toppings, including sandwich options with lox and whitefish salad, keeps the bagel game interesting for a dedicated legion of regular customers.",

          "description": "As cities grow, they tend to swallow and overtake smaller towns that were once situated well outside. Often this leads to a loss of the local identity, unless the former towns fight back. Weil am Rhein did this in a very creative way by building giant chairs.\n\r\nThe town is situated just over the German border, not far from Dreiländereck, where the borders of Germany, France, and Switzerland meet. It used to be completely separate from Basel, but as both cities grew, their borders started touching more and more, to the point where many people started thinking that Weil am Rhein was the German part of Basel.\n\r\nPeople in Weil am Rhein disliked this and decided that they needed a new and separate identity from Basel. They decided that giant chairs were the key. Large chairs started appearing all over the town, not only on the ground but also on top of buildings. Most of them are made in a way that makes them climbable.\n\r\nIn the 1970s, a local artist and architect named Lassù burned chairs as an art form. He built a large concrete chair on top of a pyramid to allow for recurrent burnings.\n\r\nFurniture is a big bar of the history of Weil am Rhein. The town is home to the headquarters of the Vitra Corporation, one of the largest manufacturers of designer furniture in Europe. The company operates the Vitra Design Museum, which explores the history of furniture and interior design. Its collection includes several historically significant chairs, including Eero Saarinen's Tulip Chair, Charles and Ray Eames' iconic Lounge Chair, and many more.",

While Seiyun may not have the iconic status that its neighboring city enjoys, it is home to one of the largest mud buildings in the world: the Sultan Al Kathiri Palace (aka Seyun Palace). This seven-story palace boasts a total of 45 rooms. Under the white coating is a structure built according to ancient mud-building techniques. \n\r\nAlthough a much more ancient military structure existed on this site, the construction of the Sultan Al Kathiri Palace as it has survived into the 21st century was completed in the 1920s.

          "description": "Spread over 80 square meters and surrounded by meadows, Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns seem so out of place that for a long time, these columns were thought to have been the floor of a church that no longer exists. This belief was not completely implausible, considering that the first settlers on the island were probably Irish Hermits.  If this had been the case, they would most likely have built a church. These are all conjectures, but even if proven true, it is now clear that Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns was definitely not a human creation, but a natural one.\n\r\nLike basalt columns elsewhere in the world, those in Kirkjugólf are the product of lava cooling. As lava cools, it contracts, and as it contracts, it cracks. The cracks start at the very bottom of the lava field and travel vertically to the top, a process that results in the creation of columns. Sharp contours and repetitive patterns make these sites seem like they were sculpted by a human hand.   \n\r\nDescriptions of the Kirkjugólf Basalt Columns often report that they consist of hexagonal columns, but even this detail is misleading, for there is no shortage of pentagons, heptagons, and octagons. Yet, in spite of the variety of shapes (or more likely because of it), these columns fit in perfectly next to one another, leaving only a narrow, consistent gap between them.\n\r\nOf note, the nearby village of Kirkjugólf was named after the basalt columns, and it literally means “the church floor.”  Following the discovery of its natural origins, the basalt columns were given the less-imaginative name of “Kirkjugólf Natural Monument.”",

In the 19th century, \"park” was a common term in the Western United States for a wide valley, and Fairplay is located in South Park. (The animated sitcom is set in the same area.) Hence, this re-creation of a late 19th-century camp at the edge of modern Fairplay uses the original name. It consists of some 44 period buildings, seven of which are original. The rest were moved in from other old mining towns in the area. \n\r\nThe buildings include mock-ups of businesses typical in a settlement like this, including a blacksmith shop, livery stable, hotel, dry goods store, drugstore, carpenter shop (which doubled as a funeral parlor), assay office, print shop, and so on. There are also living quarters, a church, a school, and even a mine and a locomotive. Contemporary equipment such as mining tools, carriages, and wagons are also extensively displayed.\n\r\nUnpaved streets run between the buildings, some with authentic boardwalks, and you can wander around as much you wish. Sometimes exhibitions of 19th-century trades such as blacksmithing are also presented.",

John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, stopped by for a visit in 1867 and detailed his experience in his 1916 book Thousand Mile Walk To The Gulf. The cave was once a source of drinking water and hydroelectricity for the City of Horse Cave and the remnants of the equipment are still visible during the cave tour. \n\r\nElectricity generated from the cave stream powered the home above the cave, which included a dentist's office and two other buildings in town. Horse Cave was actually the first town in Kentucky to have incandescent lights. The cave operated for commercial tours from 1916-1943, until household waste from businesses and the community above polluted the cave streams.\n\r\nThe cave remained closed until 1992, when the combined efforts of local leaders and the nonprofit American Cave Conservation Association (ACCA) joined forces to clean up and restore the subterranean site. A regional sewage treatment system went online in 1989, which stopped pollution from entering the cave. This allowed nature to take its course and Hidden River Cave is now considered to be an environmental success story. The ACCA also opened the American Cave Museum in the entrance to the cave in 1992.\n\r\nToday, tour guides explain Hidden River Cave’s history and general information about caves, the animals that inhabit them, and some of the uses of caves. This tour is not only entertaining, it is educational.",

Being accepted into the prestigious association is no easy feat. Certain standards for craftsmanship and quality, as well as a commitment to upholding traditional baking techniques, must be met by every bakery to be approved. Plus, Germany has stringent regulations for becoming a certified baker including formal education and vocational training.\n\r\nThe concept here revolves around a fusion of Eastern European and Israeli cuisines, with a focus on traditional Jewish pastries. Owners Marcin Liera-Elkin and Shahar Elkin dole out their favorite sweet and savory pastries, including two versions of braided bread inspiring the shop’s name: babka baked according to Marcin’s Polish grandmother recipe, as well as krantz from Shahar’s homeland Israel.\n\r\nOver 90 percent of the baked goods are made using organic ingredients, and the house-made yeast dough is allowed to rest for up to 48 hours. The bakery's warm and inviting atmosphere, coupled with delectable offerings, has made it a popular haven in the capital’s up-and-coming Friedenau neighborhood. It’s the perfect place to spend a couple of hours sipping coffee and savoring a sweet hazelnut babka with creamy nougat cream or a savory Sabich bagel, seasoned with zaatar and topped with aubergine and hummus, are definite favorites.\n\r\nThe inclusion of Babka & Krantz as the first Jewish bakery in the guild is a remarkable milestone, highlighting the evolving nature of Berlin's gastronomic landscape and the celebration of diverse cultural influences within the city's vibrant food scene. The bakery has become an integral part of Berlin’s steadily growing Jewish community, particularly among Israeli expats (by some figures, more than 10,000 have moved to Berlin in the last decade). It's a testament to the power of good food and the importance of preserving culinary traditions for future generations.",

Water was diverted from the East Fork of the Sevier River, atop the Paunsaugunt Plateau west of the present location of Bryce Canyon National Park, to Bryce Valley. Construction began in 1890 and the Ditch was completed in 1892. It was built entirely with muscle power, using hand tools and draft animals. It extends easterly some 10 miles to the town of Tropic, which relies on its water to this day.\n\r\nTo minimize excavation, a critical consideration with no earth-moving equipment, natural watercourses were used as much as possible. In particular, an ordinarily dry east-draining watercourse, now called Water Canyon, became a major part of the ditch. Water Canyon crosses what is now Bryce Canyon National Park, but is still in use as it was grandfathered in when the Park was created.",

Lima Syndrome is when the hostage takers start sympathizing with the hostages.

In an old issue of Names, the journal of the American Name Society, Ernest Lawrence Abel listed and described them.

I played competitively from when I was seven years old until I graduated high school. Mostly, though, I just remember being bad at it. I remember I played for the brown or blue team, and we were the worst team. I always wanted to be on the black team. The black team was really good and I was never allowed on it.\n\r\nBut then, in middle school, that all changed. I still wasn’t the best soccer player, but I became obsessed with the game.

The rest of the stone circle is made up of 10 stones.\n\r\nThere are also stones scattered around the exterior of the stone circle, their role in the site is uncertain. Further along, the Esk are the remains of another stone circle, Girdle Stanes. Girdle Stanes was once made up of 40 or 45 stones, over time, the Esk has changed course and it swept away part of the stone circle. Around 21 stones remain in place, one precariously balanced beyond the fence on the edge of the river bank.\n\r\nIt's thought that the entrance would have been located on the southeast side. The proximity of the two circles is unusual. Questions remain about why two such different style circles were built so close together. It's uncertain which was built first, although one belief is that Loupin' Stanes was built to replace Girdle Stanes after it was damaged.\n\r\nThere are also two recumbent stones between the two stone circles.

          "description": "In Japan, shopping streets that run towards major shrines or temples are quite common and often known as omote-sandō or nakamise. Quaint and busy, they typically boast a number of souvenir shops, teahouses, and restaurants, some of which may be more than a century old.\n\r\nEven on such streets, international chains such as McDonald’s and Starbucks are not uncommon. But some of their outlets, such as the Ninenzaka location in Kyoto, go the extra mile to fit into the area, incorporating unique designs. Such Starbucks outlets are officially called Regional Landmark Stores and currently 28 of them exist across Japan (out of 1,800-odd locations).\n\r\nThe Dazaifu Tenmangu Omote-Sando location, however, stands out with its striking modernist design. Jutting out of its façade is an interwoven web of cedar timber, slotted together diagonally and leading visitors into the dreamlike interior.\n\r\nDesigned by renowned architect Kengo Kuma, the bizarre lattice was made using a traditional method of Japanese architecture called kigumi. By slotting cut pieces of wood together, it can create the framework and keep it solid without the use of nails, making the structure especially durable and resistant to rust.\n\r\nNatural and soothing, the creamy brown timber seems to radiate illumination all by itself… and it does. Almost. Some of the lights are actually embedded in the tip of the wood, such as those hanging above the counter.\n\r\nIn addition to the lighting, Kuma also took charge of the interior design down to the smallest detail, from the miniature garden at the entrance to the comfortability of the couches. At the back behind a glass wall is another garden, where a plum tree—the symbol of Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine—stands, also doubling as a smoking area.",

Most serious attempts at counting city museums seem to provide widely varying results, depending on membership to organizations, definitions of what counts as a museum, and city limits. However, the top three spots consistently seem to be contested between Paris, Moscow, and London, with Mexico City often appearing in the top 10. Among such museo-graphical wealth, some spaces need to offer something that makes them stand out.\n\r\nThe Photography Archive Museum isn't even the city's only museum dedicated exclusively to photography, so in order to draw in visitors, it offers heavily-themed exhibits.

This was a time of great conflict that saw many wars throughout Europe. During the 1853-1856 Crimean War, an alliance between the Ottoman Empire, France, the United Kingdom, and Sardinia-Piedmont defeated the Russians, who attempted to take land from the Ottomans. Despite the Russian defeat, the British army was impressed by the redan field fortifications used by Russian forces. A redan is a V-shaped fortification that faces an enemy's expected attack. The British army took note of the effectiveness of the fortifications and decided to construct a replica in Aldershot's military town, just north of the town's center. The replica was used to tra…",

After undergoing numerous changes, its present form dates back to the second half of the 18th century. If you look carefully at the part of the palace on the corner of Via Cavour, you will notice the sample of the \"Parmesan brick,\" the ancient unit of measurement of Parmesan builders, embedded and framed in the wall.\n\r\nIt measures approximately 28 centimeters long, 12 centimeters wide, and 5.6 centimeters thick. The brick measure, displayed in antiquity by the kilnsmen, served to prevent the placing on the market of dwindling sizes and the resulting fraud.\n\r\nThe ancient Italian units of measurement were local units in use throughout the centuries in different parts of Italy. Although they often had similar names, they had very different origins and values. As early as the 11th century, the different local realities realized their own units of measurement. Over time, boundary changes led to heterogeneous units of measurement being brought together under the same administration with obvious problems for duties, taxation, and trade. Rare and not very fruitful were some attempts at unifying units of measurement, for which it would be necessary to wait until the 19th century, when local units of measurement were gradually replaced by the metric system.",

          "description": "Hidden behind a wall, which feels like a prison yard, a striking memorial attempts to commemorate and give a brief timeline of the events leading up to 19 men being hanged as Molly Maguires between 1877 and 1879 in the Pennsylvania coal region.\n\r\nThe bronze statue was created by Zenos Frudakis and erected in 2009 in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. The imagery of the statue is of an anonymous man with his hands and feet both bound by rope and a hood over his head, as he waits for the gallows.\n\r\nMolly Maguires were Irish immigrants that worked in the anthracite mines in Schuylkill, Carbon, Luzerne, Columbia, and Northumberland Counties in Pennsylvania. At least 19 miners were hanged between 1877 and 1879 for crimes associated with the Molly Maguires group, who were fighting with mine owners for basic living rights. \nThe miners at the time were treated poorly, with low wages and awful working conditions. The miners felt they were being taken advantage of and exploited by the mine owners, and formed the Molly McGuires. (The name comes from early 19th-century Ireland, when a woman named Molly Maguire protested against English landlords who tried to steal people's land.)\n Both sides during this conflict resorted to violence, with many people dying on both sides from murders to suspicious deaths to dynamiting of mines to close the mines so that the mine owners lost money. Both sides blamed the other side whenever anything went wrong, and would fight back with violence. \n Chronologically, the trials of the Molly McGuires ended on January 14, 1879, when Martin Bergin, the 19th Molly was executed and hung in Pottsville for the murder of Patrick Burns. \n The monument pays tribute to all the miners that lost their lives during this time, there is a black plaque dedicated to them with their names inscribed. The dedication marker lists \"Sir Sean Connery\" as chairman of the advisory committee. Connery played the lead role in the fictional movie, The Molly Maguires.",

No doubt, prospectors swarmed over the area back in the day, but they found nothing to warrant further effort. The result is that this area is not seamed with roads and jeep trails connecting adits, prospect pits, abandoned buildings, spoil heaps, and other mining residua. The southern Reveille Range is an almost untouched piece of nature. \n\r\nA highlight of the range is Fang Ridge, a ridge of red rock spires running east to west, perpendicular to the main range. The \"fangs\" are composed of dacite, a hard volcanic rock, which is sturdy enough to attract nearby rock climbers. The fangs reach an elevation of some 6,000 feet above sea level.\n\r\nThe only road into the south Reveille Range runs along the south side of Fang Ridge, which provides easy access to the pristine landscape. This road runs by Pyramid Spring, one of the handful of perennial water sources in the range, and continues for another half mile. It ends at a wide parking area below the ridge. The site was used for radiation monitoring back when nuclear testing was being carried out on the Nevada Test Site to the south.",

In the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, crocodiles sunbathe along the muddy banks that line the steep cliffs of Sumidero Canyon. On the small, rural island of Tashirojima, off the coast of eastern Japan, cats lounge peacefully as waves tickle the shore of “Cat Island.” From June to September in Manitoba, some 3,000 beluga whales sing and swim their way along northern Canada’s Churchill River. With a bit of luck, you may even find yourself eye to eye with some of these incredible creatures as they’re busy migrating, raising their young, and getting their tan on during the warm summer months.\n\r\nWe recently asked readers on our Facebook page to tell us about their most memorable animal encounters as part of our ongoing Sum…",

          "description": "In the small town of Ellsworth, Maine, stands a structure that's as fascinating as it is improbable: a barn that's home to neither poultry nor livestock, but an astonishing assortment of antiques and books. The Big Chicken Barn, stretching over 21,000 square feet, is a testament to the unusual, the nostalgic, and the whimsical.\n\r\nThe barn's name is not a misnomer, but a nod to its history. Erected in the 1950s, the massive structure initially served as a chicken house for over 20,000 hens. Today, however, its wooden floors echo with the soft rustle of flipping pages and the murmur of intrigued visitors.\n\r\nThe barn's upper level teems with antiques, from vintage furniture and rustic kitchenware to historical memorabilia and quirky collectibles. Each piece tells a story, transporting the onlooker to a bygone era.\n\r\nDownstairs, the barn has been transformed into a massive used bookstore, home to over 150,000 titles. It's a veritable paradise for the lover of a good tale, and an unsuspecting find. The book collection spans all genres, including rare editions and out-of-print titles that would enthrall any book hunter.\n\r\nWalking through the Big Chicken Barn feels like stepping into a different world—one where time slows, objects whisper tales of the past, and the joy of discovery is around every corner. Every visit promises something new, thanks to the ever-changing inventory sourced from auctions, estate sales, and individual sellers.\n\r\nNot only is the Big Chicken Barn a treasure trove for antiques and books, but it's also a testament to the magic that can occur when space is repurposed and transformed. Once a bustling hub of the poultry industry, the barn now serves as a sanctuary for lovers of history, literature, and the eclectic.\n\r\nWhether you're a dedicated collector, a casual browser, or a traveler looking for an offbeat experience, the Big Chicken Barn offers an adventure in exploration. And like the best adventures, you never know what you'll find.",

          "description": "Nicknamed the \"city of ghosts,\" An Bang Cemetery is an impressible display of artistic construction and wealth. \nThe history of An Bang Cemetery is intertwined with the emigration of residents from An Bang Village to Europe and the United States after the reunification of Vietnam in 1975. These emigrants sent money back to their relatives, making An Bang one of the wealthiest villages in the country. The affluence of the town is evident in the grand houses and neatly paved driveways seen while driving through the streets. The residents dedicate their time to constructing extravagant mausoleums within the 250-hectare cemetery, adjacent to a beautiful, empty sandy beach. \n\r\nThe building of these structures began in 1995 and has since become increasingly lavish, often reaching two or three stories high. Adorned with intricate gold carvings of dragons and mythical creatures, these mausoleums even feature fully functional bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens. This lavish display reflects not only the residents' opulent lifestyle but also their strong belief in the afterlife and the importance of honoring their ancestors.\n\r\nAccording to their beliefs, meticulously caring for and decorating the tombs will bring good fortune to the family. The cost of constructing these tombs can reach as much as £50,000 (GBP), an extraordinary amount in a country where poverty is prevalent. Visiting this unique cemetery, surrounded by towering tombs, gives a ghostly and awe-inspiring experience, allowing one to imagine the splendid kingdom where the spirits of ancestors reside.",

It is renowned for its historical and cultural significance, as well as its remarkable architecture and religious art.\nThe Visoki Dečani Monastery was built in the mid-14th century (between 1327 and 1335) by King Stefan Dečanski of Serbia. It was established as a royal endowment and served as a mausoleum for the Nemanjić dynasty. Representing the height of Serbian medieval architecture, encompassing both Byzantine and Romanesque styles with distinct Serbian elements, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2004. It represents the historical and artistic achievements of Serbia in this area.\n\r\nThe monastery complex consists of the main church, several chapels, monk cells, and a defensive wall. Furthermore, frescoes cover the walls and ceilings of the main church, depicting biblical scenes, saints, and the lives of Serbian rulers. The art is renowned for its vivid colors, detailed craftsmanship, and spiritual expression. It serves as a place of worship, pilgrimage, and cultural preservation, playing a vital role in maintaining the Serbian Orthodox Christian tradition.\nDespite the complex political situation in the region, Visoki Dečani Monastery remains a prominent spiritual and cultural destination, attracting visitors from around the world who come to admire its beauty and learn about its rich history.

The land was owned by John Reed, a former Hessian soldier, who fought for the British in the Revolutionary War. Reed and his family settled onto a farmstead in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, Northeast of Charlotte. \n\r\nThe story of the gold discovery began in 1799 when Reed's son found a large yellow rock in a nearby creek. The rock weighed 17 pounds. Not originally recognized as gold, legend has it that the family used the rock as the doorstop for the family house. \n\r\nA nearby jeweler from Fayetteville identified the rock as gold in 1802 while visiting the home. It was purchased for a portion of its true worth. Eventually, word got out and gold was discovered in nearby creeks and land, triggering a gold rush. At its peak, the estimated value mined each year in the mine and surrounding areas topped over one million dollars, including a 28-pound gold nugget that was also found at Reed's farm.",

Beginning in late October, the trees put on a spectacular display as their fan-shaped leaves turn from bright green to brilliant yellow.

The largest was the Sheldon Antelope Refuge in the northwest corner of Nevada next to the Oregon line. It began with the purchase of 34,000 acres at Last Chance Ranch in 1931. In 1936, President Roosevelt added over 540,000 adjacent acres of Federal lands, with the total acreage combined into a single wildlife refuge. At present, the refuge is managed in conjunction with the smaller Hart Mountain Antelope Refuge in Oregon, which was created at the same time.\n\r\nThe Sheldon Refuge consists of high desert steppe, including tilted tablelands and deep canyons (such as Thousand Creek Gorge, which overlaps the refuge slightly on the east side). It encloses the Virgin Valley opal mines, which were grandfathered in. Virgin Valley is also the site of the current refuge headquarters, as well as the Dufurrena Ponds, which provide waterfowl habitat and are open to fishing with a Nevada license.\n\r\nThe Last Chance Ranch was the original heart of the refuge, and indeed served as the headquarters in the early years. The ranch building is still preserved as a historical site.",

One of the most notable buildings is a seemingly ordinary skyscraper that is wrapped in a colorful mosaic. \n\r\nThe building dates from the early 1960s and was erected in place of its predecessor which was bombed during warfare. It was the first skyscraper in the area and was built to impress. Designed by the Hermann Henselmann, B. Geyer, and J. Streitparth architect collective, this 12-story high-rise was at its time Europe's most advanced center for teachers and educators—sporting a huge library behind the three-story spanning mosaic that held over 650,000 books, but also a cafe, restaurant, bar, bookshop, and cabaret. \n\r\nThe mosaic itself was designed and implemented by Walter Womacka and uses a staggering 800,000 stones. The work of art is titled \"Our Life\" and showcases idealistic snippets of socialist life in East Germany, with a special focus on educators. The style is made in that of Mexican mural art and it is one of thelargest works of art in Europe.",

That year, travelers of the Mohawk Trail forded the Deerfield River rather than pay the toll at the turnpike bridge. In 1810, they won the battle for free travel on all Massachusetts roads.\n\r\nThe act is memorialized by the historical marker at the Shunkpike Rest Stop.

          "description": "Zamora is famous all over Spain because of its Holy Week processions, and all of them start the moment Barandales makes his bells ring. He is the first person you see (and hear) at he start of every procession. Without this person, Zamora and its Holy Week would not be the same.\n\r\nBarandales is a well-known figure in charge of signaling the approach of the several Zamora Passion processions. His distinguishing features include two large bells that hang from his wrists, which he constantly rings to alert locals and guests of the procession's approach. With his emblematic jingle, the crowd goes silent to show respect for the religious ceremony.\n\r\nBeing \"el Barandales\" is a complete honor for locals of Zamora and it used to be an hereditary position. Nowadays every cofradía (group of penitents taking part in a procession) appoints their own Barandales.\n\r\nThe bronze statue of Barandales is the work of sculptor Ricardo Flecha and it was made in 1994. The statue is located in the Plaza de Santa María la Nueva, in front of the Museum of Holy Week, where some of the best images of the Holy Week in Zamora can be found. Barandales statue is the homage to the fifth centenary of the foundation of the Brotherhood of the Holy Burial.",

          "description": "Alma Woodsey Thomas was born in Columbus, Georgia, on September 22, 1891. She moved to Washington, D.C., in 1907 with her family who were seeking educational opportunities that were not as easy to come by in the South during the Jim Crow era. Thomas attended Howard University and initially studied costume design before changing course at the urging of a professor, James Vernon Herring, who entreated her to become the first student in the new art department.\n\r\nAfter graduating in 1924 with a degree in fine arts (and perhaps the first Black woman in the country to do so), she shared her gift by becoming a teacher. She plied her trade at Shaw Jr. High from 1925 until 1960.\n\r\nShe remained busy during her 35 years as an educator. In 1934, she earned her master's degree from Teachers College of Columbia. Four years later, she created the first art gallery in the D.C. public school system. In 1943, she collaborated with her former professor James Herring and artist Alonzo J. Aden to create one of the first African American art galleries in the U.S., the Barnett Aden Gallery.\n\r\nShe returned her focus to her own art in the 1950s and developed an emphasis on color while working with other artists at American University. Concurrently, she took an interest in the Washington Color School, whose works consisted of abstract shapes of pure color.\n\r\nIn 1964, Thomas suffered an arthritic attack that she feared might render her unable to continue painting, but she persevered and altered her style to capture the natural beauty she saw outside her window. She continued to thrive into her 70s, and in 1972, she had exhibitions at the Whitney Gallery and the Corcoran Art Gallery.\n\r\nAlma Thomas died on February 24, 1978. In 2016, almost 40 years after her passing, one of her abstract paintings from 1966 entitled Resurrection became the first painting by a Black woman to hang in the White House. Another one of Thomas's paintings, entitled Pansies In Washington, hangs in the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art.",

As far as the eye can see, there are rows of grapes just like every other winery in Sonoma County. It's only once security opens up the gate and tells you to \"stay to the right of the giant head\" that the surreal atmosphere begins to creep in.\n\r\nOn the drive up to the main house, vineyards full of the highest-scoring pinot noirs in the world are ignored as all attention is focused on the few contemporary sculptures in sight, some blending into the California landscape much better than others. Finally, by the time you reach the end of the driveway, you aren't greeted with some grandiose Victorian mansion, but rather a quaint, 1-story Scandinavian-influenced house. This is the Donum Estate: a place where oenophilia meets modern art that is somewhat reminiscent of Bond villain's evil lair.\n\r\nFounded by Allan and Mei Warburg, the Donum Estate spans around 200 acres and is home to over 50 pieces of art, heavily influenced by the couple's own ethnic backgrounds. Some of the more famous pieces include: Love Me, a giant mirrored steel heart sculpture symbolically overlooking the entire estate, and Love (Gold/Red), the iconic pop art image created by Robert Indiana that gained fame in Philadelphia's John F. Kennedy Plaza. There is also Crouching Spider, which, as you can guess, is a massive steel spider carefully tucked into an undistinguishable space to possibly get the jump on arachnophobes.\n\r\nAlthough its fascinating art collection makes Donum quite memorable, that isn’t the only draw of the estate. What would a world-famous vineyard be without offering a wine tasting! If you are able to secure an exclusive reservation, the Donum Estate offers several different types of tastings. Just make sure to save up for the experience because it can end up being quite pricey, especially if you order a few bottles to go!",

Sellon of the Royal Engineers.\n\r\nWork commenced in 1866 and was completed in 1867 at a cost of 241,800 Rupees. It was the first spandrel arch bridge in Pune and was formally opened to the public in 1869. On both sides of the bridge, there are statues of two lions looking to the side holding a sphere under a paw. These are representations of the Medici Lions at Villa Medici in Rome.\n\r\nToday, the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic and has been converted into an arts plaza, with seating arrangements and an open space.

          "description": "In 1834, Athens was a small city of 7,000 residents. When Athens was declared the new capital of Greece on September 18, 1834, a large building boom soon followed. A plot of land in the Makrigianni area, near the Acropolis, was selected for a military hospital. Bavarian military engineer Wilhelm von Weiler designed the building and did so in a German Neo-Romantic style. Construction began in late 1834 and was completed in 1836. The finished military hospital was three stories tall with a large basement and an exterior of coated stone masonry.\n\r\nAn assassination attempt on the prime minister, the death of King Alexander from a monkey bite, and territorial disputes all led to an increase in the resources needed by the Royal Gendarmerie so the building was converted to regimental barracks in 1920.\n\r\nIn 1944, the building fell victim to the Dekemvriana (December events), a 37-day period of fighting in the streets of Athens between British forces supporting the Greek government and communist rebels (who had fought alongside British troops against the Germans just months earlier). The building was badly damaged, with a large portion of the coating destroyed, exposing the stonework. Following the Dekemvriana, most of the remaining coating was removed and the majority of the building exterior was left as exposed stonework.\n\r\nIn 1978, the building was turned over to the Ministry of Culture. Use by the ministry was limited until a full renovation was completed between 1985 and 1987. After renovations were complete, the building was inaugurated by the late Minister for Culture, Melina Mercouri, as the Museum of the Center for Acropolis Studies.\n\r\nThe center now contains as original terracotta architectural remains from the Acropolis, a series of plaster casts depicting successive uses of the Acropolis from prehistoric Neolithic times to the 18th century, and numerous other important artifacts.",

          "description": "The northeast corner of South Africa is a patchwork of landscapes, from open, hoodoo-studded plains in the interior and wetlands along the coast to surprising, dense coniferous forests—a relic of the colonial period, when alien species were brought from Europe to create massive pine plantations. Beneath this diversity lies one of the world’s largest gold deposits, and, beneath that, more than three miles underground, there’s a geological treasure from deep time: layers of rock that provide evidence of Earth’s earliest deep freeze.\n\r\nAccording to a paper published recently in Geochemical Perspectives Letters, these rocks hold multiple clues to the world's oldest glaciers, sheets of ice that covered the area an astonishing 2.9 billion years ago.

At the intersection of Julia and Magazine Streets, the Mistick Krewe of Comus kicked off Fat Tuesday with a parade that marched through the main thoroughfares of the city to the Gaiety Theatre, on Gravier Street between Carondelet and Baronne Streets.\n\r\nThe organized procession coalesced around a single theme, “The Demon Actors in Milton’s Paradise Lost,\" and featured classic characters from Paradise Lost, such as Pluto and Prosperine, the Fates, fairies, harpies, gorgons, Satan, Isis, Osiris, and many others. Once the parade reached the Gaiety Theatre, members presented four tableaus taken from Paradise Lost: Tartarus, the Expulsion, the conference of Satan and Bee…",

Its main outlet, dubbed the Otaru Orgel Museum, boasts thousands of items for sale as well as small exhibits of European antiques, automata, and dioramas depicting the history of music boxes.\n\r\nThe \"museum\" is housed in a huge, three-story brick building built in 1912 as a rice merchant's storehouse, a historic monument worth seeing on its own. Inside, spacious halls with quaint wooden beams and dazzling chandeliers gleam with a multitude of music boxes, many of them lushly decorated. Some are of more traditional kinds, from snow globes to piano-shaped antimony chests in Rococo style, while others are uniquely designed in the forms of princesses, teddy bears, Chinese Zodiac animals, Ferris wheels, and even sushi.\n\r\nUp on the second floor runs an elegant, lamp-lit corridor with historical exhibits and antique, luxury music boxes such as the Orpheus and the Reuge, as well as a section where local handicrafts are showcased. The third floor is home to a nostalgic attic called The Sound of Dreams, focusing on character-themed music boxes and stationery items, particularly those of Studio Ghibli and Monchchichi.\n\r\nWhen visiting, don't forget to take a picture with the icon standing in front of the building: the world's largest steam clock. Made in 1994 by Canadian clockmaker Raymond Saunders, credited as the creator of the world's first steam clock in Gastown, the Otaru Steam Clock is 18 feet tall and plays a five-note melody every 15 minutes, exhaling steam into the air.",

The monument to Federico Rubio y Galí ended up decapitated by a cannon projectile and pierced by hundreds of bullets.\n\r\nAfter the war, the monument was somehow \"pardoned,\" despite the doctor's Republican background, and later rebuilt and left as it is seen today, keeping the bullet holes and the shrapnel scars it had received.",

The 301 served this role for eight years, before Gainesville-Midland was purchased by Seaboard Locomotive and the engine was donated to the city of Charlotte for display. \n\r\nOnce gifted to Charlotte, the 301 was installed at Freedom Park, a beautiful 98-acre park in the heart of the Queen City. Since 1959, this display has served as a monument to the importance that engines of this type once played on rail lines across the country. It also serves as a unique piece of playground equipment, as kids and adults can access the engineer’s cabin for a glimpse into the past. \n\r\n\nThe engine can be freely visited at the Freedom Park playground at no cost.

He started in 1924 and spent the next 25 years at a remote site in the mountains building this elaborate monument.\n\r\nThe monument sits on a beautiful site in the mountains overlooking the Churfirsten mountain range in Switzerland. Bickel built it in a style inspired by Greek temples, with tall marble columns and mosaic murals. The murals on one wall depict a family—man, woman, and the creation of a new life. On the opposite wall, the murals depict the struggles of life and the path to a spiritual awakening.",

She has no priors about acts of service and what it means, but felt incredibly excited to keep at it. Why? \n\nWhat is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? \n\nOne is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. \n\nSimilarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.",

I should have said something like \"why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters by adopting more moderate positions\"?  As I suggested in a post a few years ago, another way to appeal to moderate voters is by focusing on the negative--fears of what the extremists on the other side might do.  That's what the Democrats have done, and it's worked pretty well because many prominent Republicans have taken extreme positions.  Also, there is an asymmetry on the abortion issue--it's easier to find shocking examples of women who were denied abortions that most people will agree should have been allowed (e. g., the case that came up shortly after the Dobbs decision, a 10-year-old rape victim who had to travel out of Ohio to get an abortion) than shocking examples of women who had abortions that most people agree shouldn't have been allowed.  So if it comes down to a contest of extreme positions, the side favoring legal abortion is likely to win.",

Murrow that ran on March 9.  \nSince that time, I've found more data--Gallup sometimes asked for ratings on a scale of +5 (like very much) to -5 (dislike very much), so you can collapse those into favorable (positive) and unfavorable (negative).  This makes it possible to extend the range of the analysis, looking at approval during and after the Se…",

They were thinking of using svyrecvar, the variance estimation function that underlies most things in the package. That’s not actually the easiest approach: svyrecvar works with estimating questions, but for the kurtosis we don’t have estimating functions and instead have an explicit definition in terms of totals: \\[\\kappa = \\frac{E[(X-\\mu)^4]}{E[(X-\\mu)^2]^2}.\\] It’s likely to be easier to work with svycontrast and represent \\(\\hat\\kappa\\) as a function of estimated moments.",

It was developed for use with .Rmd files Xaringan and presently does not work with Quarto. I hacked-up a version of Flipbookr that does work with Quarto. Using it with Xaringan should be exactly the same as before. Right now it’s incomplete. I’ve just focused on getting the main user-facing function, chunk_reveal() to work. But this is also most of what the package does. Here’s a proof-of-concept Quarto presentation showing what’s working right now. You can go directly to the slides if you prefer.",

You are also reading a section that is much simpler than before (I think/hope), so I hope you like it.  But there is also a higher chance of errors or infelicities, so please let me know if you are not happy.  \r\n\r\nThe proof of Krull's Principal Ideal Theorem is the same, and I continue to be unhappy that I have not internalized it.  But the rest has become much nicer (after I've talked with people, read some Hochster and Qing Liu and some others, and imbibed more folklore).",

I see what you mean, and it definitely could be.  The one with times maps to the one with the otimes, which maps to the right side of that map in the notes.  So we're both right.

          "description": "I have been kicking around the generalization of spherical harmonics to vector spherical harmonics, and how that might generate the tensor spherical harmonics to all orders of tensor and all parities. I think I got it today! For every spherical harmonic (ell and em), there are three vector spherical harmonics obtained by multiplying by the radial vector, taking the transverse gradient, and taking the transverse gradient and crossing it into the radial direction. I think these can be generalized (using, say, the Ricci calculus) to make the 2-tensors and so on. If I am right, this is a new way to represent tensor fields on the sphere. Use cases: Cosmic backgrounds, and ocean dynamics.",

Pacheco is working on the raw imaging data from the imaging module. We discussed how to display the imaging so that an astronomer can confirm the the noise level and rough noise properties in the pixels. We discussed adjustments to our plots of the housekeeping data to aid in our interpretation of it.

          "description": "I started writing in a possible grant proposal (that would be in collaboration with others) about the trustworthiness of machine-learning emulators. Emulators are systems that learn the input–output relationship of a computationally expensive simulation and produce (or speed the computation of) new simulation outputs, reducing total computational requirements for a given number of simulations. These are so important now that the ESA  and  data-analysis plans crucially involve emulation.EuclidSimons Observatory\nThe issue is: How do we trust that the emulators are giving good outputs? There is no obvious way to test them, except by comparing to held-out training data. But in large-scale structure contexts, no amount of held-out data can test the enormous input data space. I don't know how we will ever trust such systems (and damn do we need to!), but I have some ideas about how to improve the situation. One involves enforcing physics symmetries on the emulators. Another involves running adversarial attacks on them.",

          "description": "All week I have been discussing with Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA) the possibility that we could find the elusive, truly zero metallicity stars in the Milky Way halo. This from an email I wrote today, reacting to the observational point that no-one has ever seen such a star:\nHow could there be absolutely ZERO zero-metallicity stars in the Milky Way? Here's everything I got:\n\nMaybe there are literally no low-mass stars ever made at zero metallicity. Absolutely none, at high precision. This is possible, given how little we know about star formation and the IMF.\nMaybe stellar evolution is so weird at zero metallicity that low-mass stars go dark by 13 Gyr. I very much doubt that this is a possibility. But maybe low-mass stars at primordial abundances never burn and just slowly collapse into white-dwarf-like condensed objects on a very long cooling timescale. They would be super cold by now, like 100 K maybe??\nMaybe low-mass stars form slower than high-mass stars in star-forming regions at zero metallicity. This permits a few of the high-mass stars to quickly evolve and explode, polluting the outsides of the just-forming low-mass stars. These low-mass stars would then have low but non-zero surface metallicities, and be very alpha-enhanced. This is possible, although would it really leave NO zero-metallicity low-mass stars behind?\nMaybe low-mass stars somehow self-pollute at formation (or later in their lives). Maybe the nuclear fusion kicks in slightly before gravitational steady-state or radiative zones are set up, and the first bit of nuclear burning gets mixed in to the stellar envelopes? These stars would appear to have non-zero (but weird, carbon-enhanced maybe?) abundances. Or maybe this happens later in life because of some weird internal mixing. I have literally no idea whether any of this is possible.",

Thus we can integrate a set of patches into a surrogate combined spectrum for one rotating star covered in convecting patches. We discussed how we might do that, technically, and what projects we might then do with the output.

Think: Finding the mean age of a cluster, where each star in the cluster got an age estimate from a discriminative ML method trained on stars with known ages. This is because the discriminative ML methods output something very akin to posterior quantities, and if you average a bunch of posterior estimates, you are multiplying in a prior times itself many times; eventually the prior dominates the inference (in many cases).\nContardo's point: If what you want is a label for a collection of objects, like that mean age, you should train on . That is, make a training set where you have sets of N stars, labeled by mean age. Then this model can be applied to a new collection of stars and deliver a mean age estimate! Haha, brilliant.

But Abby Shaum (CUNY) and I have built a Phi-M radio, which demodulates phase variations in a carrier signal. We (with Keaton Bell, CUNY) are using it to find binary companions and planets around stars that show coherent pulsation modes in their photometry. Today I wrote down a noise model for the output of our demodulator. It isn't completely trivial. But it's good, because we can make a likelihood function for fitting our companions. Our model will end up being a limit of the more general model called  by Dan Hey (Hawai'i).Maelstrom",

          "description": "I had a conversation with Vedant Chandra (Harvard) today about how catalogs are used, and how that relates to how they are built. We started off by arguing about how principled one should be about doing a populations inference. Too abstract! So Chandra moved us in the pragmatic direction: Let's look at a very specific inference and see what matters about it. We decided to look at the distances to distant clusters in the ESA  data: How do your inferences depend on the number of stars you use, the signal-to-noise ratios of those stars, and whether your individual-star measurements are maximum-likelihood or obtained by consideration of a posterior pdf? That should answer questions, and set up some concrete points of discussion.Gaia",

He wants to avoid the theoretical models at first; that is, he wants to figure out how precisely the spectra contain temperature and metallicity and age information without having temperatures, metallicities, and ages that we believe. One approach is to compare to other data that are sensitve to temperature, metallicity, and age: If the RVS spectra can predict those data, then (conditioned on assumptions) they must contain information about temperature, metallicity, and age. This is similar to questions of risk (or expected error in prediction) in machine-learning contexts.Gaia",

One was giving feedback to Matt Daunt (NYU) who is trying to re-build the  concept for stellar radial-velocity measurement in . He has annoying optimization issues, which are very hard to diagnose! Optimization is always nasty, in my experience.wobblejax\nAnother activity was working on the abstract for Lily Zhao's (Flatiron) upcoming paper on stellar variability in the spectral domain, generated by rotating, spotty stars. She is concerned that the paper is too conceptual. I love conceptual papers! I think science moves forward through concepts and implentations, and no individual paper has to do it all.\nMy third activity this morning was working through the mathematics on a project of Abby Williams (NYU, Caltech) to measure the kinematic dipole in the all-sky  quasar catalog. There are so many different ways to measure it. I think I have a justifiable likelihood function approach, and one in which we could marginalize out—or profile out—the uncertainties in the selection function we have estimated. It's a controversial subject, so I would like to do things correctly.Quaia",
