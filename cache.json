          "description": "Starting in the late 19th century, and following a trend kicked off in Paris, Lisbon went kiosk crazy. At its peak, the city was home to nearly 70 kiosks, many of which served simple drinks—largely sweet herbal liqueurs and beer.\n\r\nSeveral of these Art Nouveau-era kiosks remain in Lisbon today, but all but one are owned by the city, who has generally leased them to larger brands that serve a bland repertoire of international drinks and snacks. But Quiosque de São Paulo, Lisbon’s only privately-owned kiosk, has gone in a different direction. \n\r\nWhen chef/restaurateur André Magalhães took over the kiosk in 2020, he deliberately chose menu items that reflected the options available during the heyday of kiosks, from the late 19th century until around the 1960s. As such, the drink menu at Quiosque de São Paulo includes items such as vinho quinado, port wine supplemented with quinine, and amarguinha, bitter almond liqueur. \n\r\nSnacks include punheta de bacalhau, an old-school Lisbon dish that combines raw salt cod, onions and olive oil, ovos verdes, literally “green eggs,” something like a deep-fried deviled egg, and pastéis de massa tenra, Portuguese hand pies—items you’ll struggle to find elsewhere in town.",

Taking the form of slices of pork served in a roll, in Lisbon that protein is typically grilled, but somewhat confusingly, the city’s most popular bifana is done in the northern style.\n\r\nYou don’t need Google Maps to know if you’ve arrived at As Bifanas do Afonso; look for the perpetual line or simply follow the aroma of porky broth that extends down the block. Your destination is essentially a stall, which specializes in one dish: thin slices of pork, braised in a mix of white wine, garlic, bay leaf, and lard (and, it’s said, Sprite), stuffed in a chewy Portuguese-style roll. \n\r\nBoost your bifana via a squirt of sweet, cheap mustard or a drizzle of house-made chili oil, and pair it with a glass of vinho à pressão, “tap wine,” made sweet with the addition of sugar and bubbly via carbonation. It’s simple, cheap, casual and utterly delicious.",

          "description": "Overlooking the River Teifi in this small Welsh village is a wooden statue of a mermaid commemorating a fisherman's generosity. The fisherman's name was Peregrine, and, in late September 1789, he had the good fortune of landing a mermaid in his nets. Overjoyed with his catch, he tied the mermaid up to his boat and set sail for St. Dogmaels, where he planned to come ashore. On the journey home, the beautiful mermaid begged and pleaded with him to let her go.\n\r\nHowever, on approaching the village, it seems that Peregrine had a change of heart. Bringing a mermaid to shore would certainly make him rich, but what fate would await her? He started to untie the knots he had used to fasten her to the boat and let her go. Recognizing this kindness, the mermaid gratefully thanked him and promised to repay him in the future.\n\r\nTen days after his unusual catch, Peregrine and his boat were again heading out to sea to catch herring. As he sailed past the sandbar in the river, the mermaid appeared at the side of his boat. She called out a warning that a storm was coming, and he should head home. He turned his ship around and went back to the village, although all of the other fishermen laughed at his sudden change of heart. However, their laughter soon turned to tears, as all of the little boats were lost in a terrible storm.\n\r\nThe mermaid statue commemorates this tale. It is a pleasant place to stop for a picnic, and also marks the start (or end) of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path, and long distance footpath running for 186 miles around the coast of Pembrokeshire, one of Britiain's National Parks.  There is a small sculpture decorated with costal wildlife often seen from the shore, but alas, there are no mermaids.",

          "description": "Per capita, the people of Portugal consume just about as many snails as the French. And Lisbon’s one-stop-shop for all its snail needs is Casa dos Caracóis, literally “House of Snails.” \n\r\nThe brand has 11 shops across Portugal, with seven in the greater Lisbon area alone. The capital’s Campolide branch is typical of the brand: spotless and brightly lit, decked out in stainless steel and snail paraphernalia, including prehistoric snail fossils. The shop stocks everything a Portuguese snail consumer could possibly need: snails, of course, but also the requisite snail peripherals, which include bread (for toasting), oregano and garlic (for boiling snails) and beer and sangria (for drinking with snails). \n\r\nAt least four varieties of snails can be bought live, to be taken home and boiled or grilled. Smaller snails are typically boiled in broth with that oregano and garlic, while larger snails are grilled. Alternatively, each shop has the facilities to boil hundreds of kilos of snails for take-away, in sizes ranging from small containers to massive €40 buckets. The vast majority of snails sold at Casa dos Caracóis are raised on farms in Morocco.",

          "description": "In the mountains of Romania near its southern border with Serbia is the small spa town of Băile Herculane. Dating back over 2,000 years to the Roman times, Băile Herculane is one of the oldest spa towns in Europe. People have been visiting the area to experience the healing power of its thermal waters for centuries. \n\r\nAccording to legend, the hero Hercules as well as members of the Roman aristocracy, bathed in the curing waters of the springs surrounding Băile Herculane. The town embraces this history, paying nod to the legend through a variety of Hercules references and a large statue of the god in its northern square.  \n\r\nBăile Herculane’s most iconic sight is the now-defunct Băile Imperiale Austriece Neptun, or Imperial Austrian Neptune Baths. Built in the 1880s, in its heyday Neptune was considered one of the most modern baths in Europe and was utilized by elite Austrian royalty. The once-opulent, baroque building now stands in disrepair, a striking sight of peeling paint and rust set against a mountain backdrop. There are several other (slightly less impressive) abandoned baths scattered around the town, as well.\n\r\nThere are a variety of abandoned Soviet-era hotels in the southern part of the Băile Herculane, architecturally interesting in their own right and serving as a reminder of the town’s varied history. Like the baths, these hotels were one thriving, nearly a decade later during the town’s revival as a popular vacation spot during the Soviet period. The contrast between buildings couldn’t be more stark, making Băile Herculane an interesting place both visually and historically. \n\r\nIf you want to experience the power of the healing waters yourself, you’re in luck. There are several thermal spas operating in Băile Herculane today, and a variety of modern-day accommodations and establishments for tourists to enjoy.",

          "description": "As the birch and spruce forests of Newfoundland’s southern coast begin to speckle and sparkle with bright yellow, a familiar and frightening figure returns to the autumn woods of the Miawpukek First Nation community in Conne River.\n\r\nFor those on a local walking trail, it emerges from the forest like a specter: a human-like figure who appears to be bound, their torso and limbs contorted into the trunk of a large birch tree—a variety that locals call “witch hazel.” Bark and wood take the place of skin and flesh. The figure bends unnaturally to its left, almost as if the tree is twisting in human-like agony, or had pulled a hiker off the trail and condemned them to be part of the forest itself.\n\r\nWhile the shape is plenty creepy all on its own—at least for those who actually notice it—in 202…",

          "description": "Sure, people say there are a thousand islands along the St. Lawrence Seaway, but is there any way to really be sure? Rising above the St. Lawrence River, this Hill Island, Ontario, observation tower has answered this question for many tourists to the Thousand Islands region of Canada for more than half a century.\n\r\nThe completion of Seattle’s Space Needle for the 1962 World’s Fair led to a boom in observation tower construction across American and Canadian cities throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the Thousand Islands region of Canada, long a resort and summer vacation destination, a Czech entrepreneur named John David was inspired to create a tourist attraction of his own.\n\r\nThe concrete structure took over a year to complete and was opened to the public on June 15, 1965. At the time of its opening, it had the smallest width-to-height ratio of any building in the world. The tower stands more than 400 feet tall (130 meters), and offers stellar views of hundreds of islands and two countries, with a distinctive spiral staircase pattern that wraps around it (which is not used by the public). The tower contains three observation decks, and it takes about 40 seconds by elevator to reach the top.\n\r\nAfter David, Hill Island local, Leonard Stratford, owned the tower for nearly 30 years. When it came time for him to retire in 2011, he sold the tower to Konrad and Heidi Linckh, who had immigrated to Canada from Düsseldorf, Germany, after falling in love with the area on their honeymoon.\n\r\nAlthough their bid for the tower was under the asking price even after sinking their life savings into the project, their ambition and desire to keep the tower open as a public tourist attraction convinced Leonard that they were the best people to be entrusted with the operation.\n\r\nEven now, visitors to the tower will be greeted by a tour guide to point out highlights of the area and to welcome them to the Thousand Islands.",

In the north, the eastern boundary would run along the 120th meridian of longitude from the 42nd parallel of latitude (the southern boundary of the Oregon territory) south  to the 39th parallel. Then it would run southeasterly from this point of intersection down to where the 35th parallel intersects the Colorado River.\n\r\nIt's one thing, though, to draw lines on a map, but quite another to actually establish them on the ground.

The ship had left Tallinn slightly behind schedule and was due to arrive in Stockholm at 9 a.m. But in the wee hours of the morning, around 1 a.m. the ship began to struggle.\n\r\nConditions were not ideal for the crossing. The cargo hold was fully loaded, but the weight was likely distributed unevenly—the ship was observed to be listing slightly to starboard. The weather during the crossing was rough, with winds of 34 to 45 miles per hour, which helped create waves of four to six meters tall.\n\r\nThe first sign the ship was in trouble was when a loud bang was heard. It is now thought that this was caused by a heavy wave hitting the bow doors.  About 15 minutes later, the visor is believed to have separated from the hull of the ship and torn open the loading ramp allowing water to rapidly enter the boat.\n\r\nIn an attempt to try and get to safety, the ship was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely. Then the ship went down.\n\r\nThe Estonia was carrying 989 people (803 passengers and 186 crew). Just 137 of them were rescued. Of the 852 who died in the accident, 757 of them were never found.\n\r\nDesigned and completed by Riho Luuse and Jaan Saar the monument is called the Broken Line. It was unveiled two years to the day after the tragedy occurred. The missing middle part of the memorial was designed to represent the sudden end of the victims' lives.",

          "description": "Creating monsters, rigging disembodied eyeballs and crafting other horror film delights is the only job that effects artist Mark Villalobos has ever had. Before he was 18, he was already learning the trade on sets like A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 and Beastmaster 2.\n\r\n“But I also love working on indie films,” he says. “You get very creative when there’s not a lot of money. Plus all the weirdos end up on low-budget stuff, and they’re the most entertaining part of the business.”\n\r\nIn 2005 he teamed up with fellow effects artist Heather Mages to form Villalobos/Mages Studios. Since then, they’ve worked on hundreds of projects, with horror and sci-fi icons like Crispin Glover and Walter Koenig, creating everything from animatronic alien babies to Val Kilmer’s severed hand.\n\r\nAtlas Obscura spoke…",

          "description": "Oginoya, now a major company known across Japan, was originally an inn adjacent to the Kirizumi hot springs, visited by such historical figures as Hirofumi Itō, Katsu Kaishū, and Akiko Yosano. Also among those luminaries was Katsura Tarō, who would later become Japan’s prime minister.\n\r\nDuring his visit to the Oginoya inn, Katsura mentioned the government’s plans to construct a railroad in the area. Hearing this, the innkeeper decided to shift his business, moving to the town of Yokokawa and establishing a kiosk just as the station opened in 1885.\n\r\nThough the new business was a success, the remote mountainous town did not receive many visitors to begin with, save for those traveling between Takasaki and Karuizawa. To provide warm meals to those passengers on the last leg of their journeys, Oginoya created tōge-no-kamameshi (“kettle rice of the mountain pass”) in 1957, now one of the most iconic station bentos of all time.\n\r\nKamameshi is a traditional Japanese rice dish cooked in an iron pot with a variety of ingredients. Oginoya’s “kettle rice” consists of chicken, quail egg, shiitake mushroom, bamboo shoot, burdock root, green peas, chestnut, pickled ginger and apricot, laid out on the soy sauce-based takikomi gohan. It comes in a Mashiko ware clay pot instead of the typical iron kettle, giving a more rustic feel to it—and not only that, it’s a souvenir you can take home.\n\r\nOginoya’s kettle rice is not only a must-try for tourists, but also a long-standing local favorite. As such, the people of Annaka often find themselves in common trouble: too many pots at home!\n\r\nBut not to worry; the pottery has plenty of reuse potential for whatever purpose you can think of. While it’s commonly used as a planter or weight, old or unneeded pots are donated back to Oginoya to be repurposed in several ways, most notably recycled for local paving. If you enjoy camping or a bit of old-world cooking, you can also cook rice or even bake bread in it.",

Founded in 1874 by brothers Alfredo and Luis Guízar de Arias, this traditional confectionary store is one of the oldest in Mexico City. Around 150 recipes from the north, south, and central regions of the country are produced artisanally in copper pots using wooden paddles with traditional ingredients.\n\r\nInitially, the sweets were brought from different states all over Mexico, but as their popularity and demand grew, the family began buying recipes from their partners. They soon began to produce the confections in the basement of their home and even invented some recipes of their own. The sweets produced then became a mix of Indigenous and European traditions.\n\r\nToday the sweets are produced in a separate workshop and another location can be found in the Colonia Roma. Nowadays, visitors can take a step back in time into the 19th-century French-style confectionary store and share a taste with generations past. It's the perfect spot to stock up on marranitos (pig-shaped cookies flavored with unrefined piloncillo sugar) or sugar skulls for the Day of the Dead. Why not try a huevo real [royal egg], an egg-yolk bread with honey and cinnamon that was even given to one of the viceroys of New Spain?",

Blowholes are created by the enormous pressure of the sea eroding landward and upward, eventually creating a hole through which the water can spew at times of high tide or turgid currents.  \n\r\nNearby there are other wonderfully scenic spots—Eagle Island Lighthouse can be seen from the coast, and the narrow headland of of Ceann an Eanaigh (Annagh Head) is a short drive from here.",

Early signs of fire were easy to spot from the tower's vantage point on top of a hill. Residents of Stavanger were warned by the ringing of a bell and the firing of cannons.\n\r\nThe watchmen inside the tower worked in teams of four to six men and rotated solo patrols during their six-hour summer and eight-hour winter shifts.\n\r\nBy the 18th century, the watchmen's role changed to only focus on fire detection duties. The last watch took place in 1922, completed by Tobias Sandstøl, who had held the position for 18 years.\n\r\nProviding there are no giant cruise ships in port, the tower provides amazing views over Stavanger, including the wooden houses at Gamle Stavanger, many of which survive today.",

          "description": "Though a landmark of the town, the Gohon Keyaki or “Five Zelkovas” of Kami-Itabashi are often met with contempt, especially from drivers who consider them an eyesore and the cause of traffic problems as they take up quite a bit of space in the middle of a road. Despite that, they are unlikely to be removed anytime soon, and their historic status may not be the only reason.\n\r\nThe Five Zelkovas once stood together on the premises of the mansion of Yūjūro Iijima, the mayor of Kami-Itabashi back when it was a village, who generously donated his land for the construction of a road cutting through the area. There was one condition: that the zelkovas were not to be removed.\n\r\nLater, following the end of World War II, developers attempted to remove the trees to expand the road, but had to give up after various accidents and illnesses fell upon them, which some interpreted as a curse.\n\r\nTo this day, the Five Zelkovas continue to stand tall and proud, though two of the original trees died in the 1970s and had to be replaced. Rumored to be haunted, some claim to have seen the ghost of an old lady or heard sobbing voices here at night.",

He was also a prolific painter and collector of Western memorabilia. Because Mitchell preferred not to sell his paintings, the majority of his work and belongings remain together in Trinidad.\n\r\nThe museum is home to 250 of Mitchell's paintings including his nocturnes (night-pieces), thousands of photographs, sketches, and 100 or more paintings by Mitchell's friends and contemporaries. Other objects like boots, whips, and hats owned and used by Mitchell are all at the museum, including over 15 saddles.",

          "description": "Although this roadside museum in Big Timber, Montana, may sound wild, it’s actually a history museum sharing the story of Sweet Grass County and the nearby mountain range, the Crazy Mountains.\n\r\nThe Crazy Mountains got their name from the Apsáalooke (Crow) Nation, who would head to the area to pray and fast, sometimes receiving revelations in return. They called the region Awaxaawapìa Pìa, which translates to “Ominous Mountains” or perhaps “crazy.”\n\r\nThere is a more outlandish—and apocryphal—story of a pioneer woman whose family was killed by Piegan (Blackfeet) Tribal members, who then fled into the mountains and lived as an outcast. This false and colonialist history is still sometimes still shared today.\n\r\nThe museum itself is mostly concerned with the settled history of the area of Big Timber. Exhibits include a look at the first settlers, industries such as mining and wool, and the Cobblestone City, a miniature diorama of Big Timber.\n\r\nThe museum is a site on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and features a garden with the types of plants that were collected from the expedition. Perhaps the highlight of the museum is the stabbur, a storehouse built and maintained by the Sons of Norway Fjeldheim Lodge #524, to honor Big Timber’s Norwegian heritage. Don’t worry, this crazy stabbur is completely harmless, and it even has a grass roof.",

I can't say for sure, but there may well be more statues than residents!\"\n\r\nIn fact, the city center is adorned with hundreds of extravagant, faux-classical, patriotic sculptures that didn't exist prior to the turn of the millennium. The Bridge of Civilizations serves as a prime example of this abundance, boasting an impressive collection of over 30 sculptures along a single downtown pedestrian crossing.\n\r\nSkopje's eccentric transformation commenced in 2008 with a budget ranging from €80 to €500 million. The project aimed to boost tourism and establish a distinctive city identity but sparked debates about diverting funds from essential infrastructure projects in favor of constructing kitsch, ornate statues, and neoclassical structures adorned with elaborate columns. This controversy led to protests and incidents of vandalism, including frequent paint-bombings of monuments.\n\r\nIn Skopje's main square, you'll discover the city's largest statue featuring Alexander the Great on his loyal steed Bucephalus. However, it goes by the alias 'The Great Warrior' due to ongoing disputes between North Macedonians and Greeks regarding his heritage. This impressive 72-foot (22-meter) bronze statue, surrounded by warriors and a central fountain, serves as the centerpiece of the city's nightly light shows. Yet, it remains an anonymous tribute to one of history's greatest military commanders. The irony lies in the city's quest for recognition while unable to use his true name, Alexander the Great, showcasing the complex historical narratives woven into Skopje's streets.",

Giallo films combine elements of murder mystery stories with tropes typically found in slasher movies. Often the protagonist has to figure out who the murderer is as characters are systematically killed off. Films like Argento's Deep Red have gone on to inspire films like the Scream franchise and I Know What You Did Last Summer.\n\r\nMuch of the filming for Deep Red took place on-location in Turin, Italy, the center of Satanist practice in Europe at the time. Especially recognizable are the Teatro Carignano, Santa Costanza, Piazza CLN, and Villa Scott, known as Villa del Bambino Urlante in the film, which all play a key role in Deep Red.\n\r\nBuilt in 1902 for Alfonso Scott, an executive of the short-lived auto company, Villa Scott stands in the affluent Borgo Po neighborhood, west of the city center. It’s one of the major works by architect Pietro Fenoglio, a pioneer of the Italian Art Nouveau movement called Liberty style.\n\r\nThe villa appears in the Argento film as the Villa del Bambino Urlante, the “House of the Screaming Child.” Rumored to be haunted, the villa sits abandoned on the outskirts of Rome (instead of Turin as in real life) and hides a vital clue to the mystery, revealing a disturbing mural of a child holding a blood-soaked knife over a ghastly body when the protagonist Marc investigates the site.\n\r\nAt the time of the production of Deep Red, the villa was owned by a convent of nuns and operated as a boarding school for girls. To use the location, the production team sent all the girls and the nuns away to Rimini and paid for their vacation.",

His arms limp at his side, a devoted woman to his right looks at him with affectionate concern, and perhaps a bit of surrender, rubbing his chest. It’s a touching scene—carved entirely from gray granite.\n\r\nIt feels almost like an imposition to cast eyes on this vulnerable moment captured in stone. But that’s how Brusa wanted it. The master granite carver in northern Barre, Vermont, just 45 miles southeast of Burlington, enlisted one of his most talented peers, Donato Coletti, to hand carve his gravestone.\n\r\nThe finished monument shows Brusa’s final moments as he struggles for breath after years of inhaling granite dust.

          "description": "Bagolino is a small village perched on the steep slopes of Val Sabbia. The history of this village goes back to the Ancient Roman Empire when it conquered these territories around the year 16 CE. There is evidence suggesting that the Romans established an outpost for changing horses along Val Sabbia. In due time, the settlement grew into a hamlet, and so an early iteration of Bagolino was born. Much more documented is the role the village played throughout the Middle Ages. \n\r\nBy and large, the village still retains a medieval feel with narrow, winding roads flanked by rows of old houses attached to one another, cobblestone staircases cutting through the historical center, and quaint little squares with timeworn fountains. The high concentration of houses and communal urban space suggests that the land is precious in these mountains.  Yet, space must be made for the dead as well as for the living. \n\r\nA cemetery dating back to the Middle Ages was once located by the main church (Chiesa di San Rocco), but Napoleon, through the Edict of Saint Claude in 1804, forbade the burial of the dead within the confines of populated areas due to hygiene concerns. And so, the Old Cemetery was built on the outskirts of the village. Mirroring the row of old houses in the historical center of Bagolino, the Old Cemetery is characterized by a row of chapels along the road. These disparate chapels were commissioned by local affluent families, and they exhibit a wide array of architectural styles. \n\r\nBehind the row of chapels is the burial ground for the less affluent. Here are hundreds of tombs, most of which are well over a century old.  Of note are ancient wrought iron crosses that testify to the mastery of local artisans.",

Most likely, any visitor to the city finds themselves walking in this park sooner or later, at least once during their trip.\n\r\nOnce part of the huge temple complex of Kan’ei-ji, the park itself boasts plenty of interesting landmarks, from an abandoned train station to the face-only Great Buddha. There is another unusual attraction hiding in plain sight, where most visitors simply walk past unaware of its existence.\n\r\nThe Suribachiyama tumulus, also referred to as the “Old Tomb on Mount Suribachi” in the description on its historical marker, sits inconspicuously along the paths in Ueno Park leading up to the zoo and the museums. Were it not for the sign, it could easily be mistaken for a regular hill, complete with simple benches on top.\n\r\nIt is, however, a legitimate archaeological site, estimated to be around 1,500 years old. Having been severely damaged throughout its history, no excavation has officially taken place here, leaving it a bit of a mystery. It is apparent, though, that it is a keyhole-type burial mound typical of the Kofun period of Japan, and a handful of pottery sherds have been found at the site.",

Adorned with the profile of a Native American with a feather headdress, it reads “SAND CREEK BATTLE GROUND / NOV 29&30, 1864”. However, what happened here in 1864 was hardly a battle. The name of the National Historic Site containing this monument bears a more accurate name for this event: the Sand Creek Massacre.\n\r\nBy the 1951 Treaty of Fort Laramie, the Cheyenne and Arapahoe held most of eastern Colorado and other land in the Great Plains. With the Pikes Peak Gold Rush bringing thousands more white settlers to the territory, Colorado officials were looking for ways to get more territory from the Indigenous people. Efforts to extract more land were met with fierc…",

          "description": "Pulling up to Cactus Jack’s Family Fun Center on the western outskirts of Oklahoma City, it’s hard to distinguish the facility from any other semi-suburban arcade that rings cities across the country. But the unassuming exterior of the building masks a passion for competitive pinball that is matched by only a few locations across the entire southwest.\n\r\nCactus Jack’s bills itself as Oklahoma’s oldest arcade, having operated in the same location since 1974. For most of its history, it was a traditional arcade, rentable for birthday parties and events, and even today most of the facility is still devoted to a standard array of now-classic arcade games and children's prizes. However, as the allure of arcades declined by the 2000s, Cactus Jack's reoriented itself around pinball. It now boasts the largest collection of modern pinball machines in the state, and one of the 10 largest public collections in the country.\n\r\nToday, the collection rivals those found at many of America's biggest pinball museums, although its commercial focus means it places a heavier weight on newer games and modern classics, as opposed to the vintage games found in similar locations countrywide. In 2015, the arcade became the host site of the first competitive pinball tournament ever held in Oklahoma, and it continues to host both national and regional tournaments, as well as meetings of the Oklahoma Pinball Enthusiasts Club.",

          "description": "In the late 19th century, the mysterious death of Zona Heaster Shue raised the perplexing question: Did she die of natural causes, or was it murder? It was true Zona's mother, Mary J. Heaster, never approved of her daughter's marriage to Erasmus Trout Shue, but did he kill her?\n\r\nOn the fateful day of Zona's death in 1897, Trout Shue asked a neighbor to call on his wife at home. When the young man walked inside, he found Zona dead on the floor. \n\r\nCuriously, Shue prevented a thorough examination of the body and helped dress her with a high collar and veil \"tied in a large bow under her chin.\" Despite his efforts, witnesses reported that Zona's head was noticeably \"loose upon the neck.\" She was buried with no charges filed against her husband, but Mary Heaster knew his secret—her daughter's spirit appeared to her, revealing foul play. \n\r\nUpon exhumation and autopsy, Zona's broken neck and crushed windpipe provided clear evidence that she, indeed, had been murdered. Trout Shue was put on trial, and Mary Heaster's testimony of her daughter's visits from beyond the grave told the real account. \n\r\nWithin an hour, the jury convicted Trout Shue of first-degree murder, sentencing him to life in prison. This bizarre Greenbrier County case is the only trial in which ghostly testimony led to a murderer's conviction.",

          "description": "Accademia Carrara is the flagship art museum in the city of Bergamo. The more than 300 items on display consist mainly of paintings and sculptures, but there is also an outlier: the Visconti-Sforza Tarot Cards. \n\r\nThe original deck of cards is from the mid-15th century, and it was created by a painter by the name of Bembo Bonifacio. However, before the end of the 15th century, three cards had gone missing, and another painter, Antonio Cicognara, decided to re-produce the missing cards. This deck of tarot cards was originally produced for the Sforza family, and it is believed some human figures are actually portraits of several members of this aristocratic family.  Subsequently, the Visconti family acquired possession of the deck.\n\r\nThese cards are a valuable testimony of what courtesans used to do to entertain themselves in their palaces, but there is more to it than this.   In fact, they also offer a glimpse into what was considered proper or fashionable at the time, and what the dwellings must have been like. At this juncture, it is important to stress that tarot cards were not used in cartomancy and divination until the 18th century, which means that these cards were used for card games—alas, the rules were not recorded.\n\r\nIt is mind-boggling to think these cards were used in games, as it is more appropriate to think of them as miniature works of art. Within the constraints of an 87-millimeter by 176-millimeter canvas, the details are extremely intricate, and the materials used include silver and gold.  Upon close inspection, one can appreciate the careful punching work that creates beautiful geometric patterns.\n\r\nA complete deck of tarot cards has 78 cards: 14 cards for each of the four suits (aka Minor Arcana), and 22 symbolic cards depicting human archetypes (aka Major Arcana). At present, the deck is divided as follows: 26 cards at Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, 35 cards at the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, and 13 cards are privately owned. Four cards from the deck are missing.",

Ulaanbaatar is home to all manner of housing, from the traditional felt tents known as ger to little log cabins in the hills and valleys. It's here that visitors can also find Dambadarjaa Monastery, one of the country's three main Khalkha Buddhist monasteries.\n\r\nThe monastery here was established in the 1700s in a quiet northwestern section of Ulaanbaatar. The remains of a Buddhist spiritual leader, the Second Khalkha Jetsundampa, are interred here.\n\r\nAlthough Dambadarjaa is one of Ulaanbaatar's main monasteries, it is not as well known or visited as the capital's other monasteries. The monastery was ransacked in the 1930s during the Stalinist purges. Subsequently, new temples were built, and the newest temples are bright and colorful.\n\r\nWhile the older temples have fallen into disrepair, the newer ones beg to be visited. Around 50 monks live here and may unlock one of the temple doors for visitors. With a little renovation work, this could become a tourist attraction, but currently, the site dwells in obscurity.",

There is also a folk belief unique to Yamanashi, which many Japanese folklorists consider an enigma: Maruishi-gami, or “spherical stone gods.”\n\r\nNames and natures do agree, as the Maruishi-gami is just what it’s called—a spherical stone. But are they natural or artificial? Hard to tell, it seems. How does one worship them? Depends on whom you ask. They appear to be a sort of dōso-jin, the roadside deity that offers protection to a traveler, but that’s not always the case.\n\r\nLikely a remnant of primitive animism surviving into modern local culture, few locals are concerned about the origin of their stone gods, only paying them the respect that they deserve. As such, academic research is severely lacking on this subject and there remains a lot to be deciphered.\n\r\nThough no survey has been done, it is estimated that there are over 700 Maruishi-gami across the prefecture, a majority of them found in Yamanashi City. The largest of its kind is located in the Nanoka-Ichina neighborhood, a boulder seated on the throne of smaller rocks. Locally beloved, it remains in good care.",

In Old City Hall, wander the John M. Edson Hall of Birds and listen to their unique calls, learn about local Pacific Northwest history (can you spot the hidden Bigfoot?), or walk inside a 19th-century padded cell in the basement’s old city jail and read the prisoners' carvings preserved in the walls. And if that’s not enough, make an appointment with a local historian at the Syre Education Center to examine the museum’s priceless photo archives. (Ken Burns has.)\n\r\nWith 200,000 items in its care, the museum's collections are a little like grandma's attic—and you never know what new and surprising items will be on display. But the Whatcom Museum is also a Smithsonian Affiliate, hosting masterpieces from around the country. From the weird to the wonderful, it has something for everyone.",

It was built by James and Macie King after 13 of the original buildings they had purchased in 1913 had been destroyed by a tragic fire in 1926. The King Family managed the barn for over 30 years. After James King died in 1958, Macie and their son ran the business for two more years before selling the family business.\n\r\nThe farm was purchased some years later by the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and with support from corporate and individual donors, the land was developed into the South Germantown Recreational Park and Maryland Soccerplex.\n\r\nThough the barn had deteriorated over the years, it was preserved due to its solid construction and augmented with replicas of the original silos. The MOOseum welcomed its first visitors in June 2010, followed by a ribbon-cutting ceremony and official opening on October 23, 2010.\n\r\nThe MOOseum includes exhibits that will interest visitors of all ages, including two model cows on which visitors can try out their milking technique. Other exhibits include various milk bottles, a collection of glass cow figurines, a database of all known dairy farms that have existed in Montgomery County, Maryland. There are also a craft room and play room to pique the interest of younger visitors.\n\r\nThe docents are extremely friendly and knowledgeable on all aspects of dairy farming, and can also point out one particularly old tree that has been around since before the King Family bought the farm.",

At the exit of the village, we find Las Hoces, where fluvial erosion of the limestone rock has given rise to a gorge with large vertical walls, some of which are over 100 meters high. Las Hoces de Vegacervera makes up one of the most remarkable natural spaces in Spain, the result of the patient fight of water against rock.\n\r\nThe narrow valley stretches just 15 meters wide in some places. It's part of a landscape of incomparable beauty, in which beech, oak, and juniper forests survive. At the bottom of the valley, the water dazzles us with its musical flow, between willows and poplars. At the end of the gorge, a steep road leads us to Valporquero, where the entrance to a cave is located.\n\r\nCueva de Valporquero is one of the youngest caves in the Iberian Peninsula, at just a million years old. (In geological time, that's quite youthful.) It seems incredible that the cold stream that accompanies us from the entrance has forged during this time the impressive formations that turn this space into a true underground cathedral.\n\r\nPaths, bridges, and stairs lead between stalactites, stalagmites, deep chasms, enormous columns, and huge cavities. The usual route takes us through various spaces with evocative names: the great roundabout, the small wonders, the fairies room, the stalactite cemetery, the high street, the solitary column, the great wonders.\n\r\nIn spring, when the stream is loaded with snowmelt from the surrounding mountains, the noise of the water currents and the waterfalls make the cave an even more fascinating place.",

          "description": "The town of Sag Harbor, New York, located on Long Island’s South Fork, may at first glance seem like a natural fit for arthouse theaters to thrive. However, its only independent cinema was preserved not only from the economic downturn facing movie theaters, but also from the effects of a devastating fire.\n\r\nA former whaling village, Sag Harbor has always had a more bohemian reputation than the nearby Hamptons, with more year-round residents including writers, artists, and movie-makers, and the theater has been part of the progression. Opening first as a vaudeville house, the theater showed its first movie on November 1, 1919. In 1936, the cinema was remodeled by famed architect John Eberson, at which point it received its distinctive Art Deco look, with a white facade and neon lettering reading “Sag Harbor” that would soon become a town landmark.\n\r\nBy the 2000s, Sag Harbor Cinema was the only arthouse cinema on the East End, and plans were readied for its long-term preservation. However, on December 16, 2016, a fire that had started at a nearby café reached the theater, severely damaging it and destroying much of the iconic exterior. The theater itself had survived, but its future was uncertain.\n\r\nThe theater saw an outpouring of support from volunteers and donations led by the non-profit organization that became its new owners. The neon sign (a replica of the original) was badly damaged in the fire but was salvaged and later repaired for free by local volunteers.\n\r\nThe theater, which had been a single screen for its entire history, was rebuilt as a triplex, with many of the historic details either salvaged or replicated from the original theater. With the neon once again abuzz, the theater reopened to the public in June of 2021.",

          "description": "The Swedish village of Falsterbo is known for the Falsterbo Horse Show, golf courses, beaches, and much more. But there is at least one place in the village that is not so \"known\" among visitors, but very familiar to locals: the Shoemaker's Pear Tree.\n\r\nTo the visitor, the place appears to consist of a lawn that is used to park cars on, and a collection of pear trees behind a fence, but not all is what it seems. This is a very special place. This is the home of the trolls, or Vättarna in Swedish.\n\r\nAccording to the saying from the olden days, the trolls live under the pear trees, in tunnels under the ground. They prefer to dress in gray, they can make themselves invisible when they want to and don't want to be disturbed. The pear trees were a gift from the residents of Falsterbo to the trolls. By gifting the pear trees to the trolls, they got a home of their own and stopped the trolls from entering people's houses at night and making a mess. \n\r\nThe trolls are skilled craftsmen and it is said that if you leave your broken shoes under a pear tree after dark, along with a bowl of porridge, you can return there at sunrise and get your mended shoes.\n\r\nAn old local legend says that if a woman goes to the place barefoot after dark, picks a pear, and eats it on the spot in complete silence, she will dream of her future husband within three days.\n\r\nThe place is by law an ancient monument and it is forbidden to take cuttings or the like from the pear trees, but it is allowed to pick the pears. For those of you who walk in broken shoes, consider a visit!",

          "description": "Originally owned by machinist John Walker, this massive factory located on what was once known as Waverly Ave in Cleveland, Ohio, housed the Walker Manufacturing Corporation.\n\r\nThe company manufactured a vast amount of heavy machinery varying from hydraulic shears and hydraulic riveters to cable railroad machinery and foundry equipment. In 1894, Walker was in the midst of a patent-infringement lawsuit, which was filed by the owner and founder of Westinghouse Electric, George Westinghouse.\n\r\nFour years later, in 1898, Walker lost the court battle, forcing him to surrender his manufacturing plant, worth $1 million at the time, to Westinghouse. Westinghouse, a skilled engineer and entrepreneur, went on to become a pioneer of the electric industry.\n\r\nOnce he became the rightful owner of the plant, Westinghouse wasted no time establishing a thriving business in Cleveland producing aluminum and brass castings with production later expanding to a variety of lights, including those used at airports and along highways.\n\r\nCycling through a number of names, Westinghouse Electric had become Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company, which was later renamed and remained, Westinghouse Electric Corporation.\n\r\nAfter World War II, the multipurpose engineering firm grew its service and sales departments. The large manufacturing facility on Waverly was closed as operations were relocated to the greater Cleveland area.\n\r\nBy 1994, Cleveland Westinghouse facilities were purchased by Eaton Corporation for $1.6 billion, with plans to convert the factory into other commercial enterprises. Nearly 30 years later, the factory still sits abandoned as it slowly falls apart with no plans of development in the foreseeable future.",

          "description": "Close to the border between Yokohama and the historic city of Kamakura lies an esoteric network of tunnels and vaulted chambers adorned with Buddhist reliefs. Commonly referred to as the Taya Caves, the Yugadō (\"yoga grotto\") of Jōsen-ji Temple is a fascinating mystery, rich in history and ambiance.\n\r\nBelieved to be the site of an ancient burial cave, the Yugadō predates the temple itself, whose origin can be traced back to 1532. The tunnels were dug in the early Kamakura period (circa 1185-1333) and used as a place for ascetic training by Buddhist monks of the esoteric Mantra Sect.\n\r\nMany of the mystical reliefs were carved by the monks as they meditated and prayed to reach enlightenment. Decorating the high vaults and the sandstone walls of the narrow passages are images of Buddhist deities, mythological creatures, and Sanskrit characters, some crumbling but otherwise preserved in good condition.\n\r\nWhen an earthquake hit the area at some point in the Edo period (1603-1868), some of the vaulted ceilings collapsed and the Taya Caves lay deserted for many decades, until local villagers started to draw the spring water from them for their rice paddies around 1830. Inspired, the monks also resumed their ascetic practice in the spiritual confinement.\n\r\nThe spring water, locally known as the Otonashi-gawa (“soundless river”), runs throughout the intricate web of caves and cascades down some of the walls. In the sacred chamber dedicated to the stone effigy of the great monk Kūkai, the serene flow is given the name of the Diamond Water, rich in healing and wish-granting properties.\n\r\nSince 1927, the grottoes have been open to the public, and the monks also continue their practice of asceticism in this esoteric dungeon to this day. Carrying a candle in hand, visitors can explore the ancient tunnels and the chambers, each of which stands in for a major sacred site across Japan; by the time you exit, you’ll have completed a good old Buddhist pilgrimage and cleansed your soul and body.",

Along with a few local insects, arachnids, skinks, and even Gila monsters.\n\r\nJeffery Ross, known as \"Buzz,\" had a lifelong love of reptiles and big dreams to match. As the former supervisor of the reptile house at the Fort Worth Zoo, Buzz had a yearning to move out to West Texas in the Davis mountains. He moved to Fort Davis and went into taxidermy with a partner. After he bought his partner out, the business, shop, and a parcel of land were his.\n\r\nThe property has a long history. His shop had been a market and general store. Behind it is an adobe-and-rock motel, used during the days of horse-drawn wagons, that closed in 1953. In between the two, there was even a 1,400-square-foot house, which became handy for keeping a few extra snakes.\n\r\nRoss had long dreamed of opening a rattlesnake museum. He already had the snakes, most of which he caught himself, so one mad day in April 2000, Ross rashly cashed in his investments and began renovating the taxidermy shop and started working on snake displays, with the help of a friend named Scott Tepes. He started with four snakes—today there are over 30. The Houston Chronicle once described it as \"the funkiest roadside attraction west of the Pecos.\"\n\r\nSadly, Ross passed away in May 2018. He passed the museum on to his longtime friend Scott Tepes, a snake expert in his own right. Given Ross's eclectic nature, Tepes had a lot of work to do cleaning things up. Over 50 vehicles have been removed from the property and the old motel in the back is even getting cleaned up.\n\r\nAlthough Tepes would prefer to call it the Fort Davis Rattlesnake Museum, however, that might take a new sign since the mural on the building has become quite beloved.",

          "description": "While in everyday life we do not use it much directly, it is crucial to know the elevation of a place to properly build and construct. For most of the world, this is based on the Amsterdam Ordinance Datum. Before this standard was put in place, each country had its own datum, off of which they could base measurements of elevation, like Sweden's Normalhöjdpunkten.\n\r\nSwitzerland is no different, but because the landlocked country did not have access to the sea, they based their measure on a seemingly random stone in Lake Geneva. The Pierres du Niton (Neptune's Stones) are a pair of glacial erratics, rocks transported by the movement of a glacier. The stones in Geneva harbor were left behind as the Rhône glacier moved across this landscape in the last ice age.\n\r\nThe reference point of the Swiss altimeter system was defined at the Pierres du Niton in the early 19th century. Later measurements, determined by a large web of connected points between Geneva and Marseille, France, put the Pierres du Niton marker's elevation at precisely 373.6 meters above sea level. The stone was picked primarily because of its proximity to the French border and a location that was unlikely to be disturbed by construction or other human activity.",

Now known as Longhorn Cavern (because the wide mouth in its ceiling caused several unsuspecting longhorns to fall to their deaths), the subterranean site has been used by humans for thousands of years.\n\r\nThere is evidence that parts of the cave were used to mine materials for arrowheads and other weapons and tools. During the Civil War, Texans mined the caverns for guano (bat poop), which could be used as an ingredient in gunpowder recipes. Legend has it that failed train robber and outlaw Sam Bass, who wreaked havoc on the nearby city of Round Rock in the 1870s, hid his stash of stolen cash in the caves, though it has never been found. \n\r\nIn the 1920s, the massive main room of the cavern served as a dance hall called the Underground Ballroom. In the 1960s, Longhorn Cavern became a licensed and stocked nuclear fallout shelter, capable of holding over 1,000 people and stocked with food, water, and other supplies.\n\r\n \n\r\nInside the cave, you can find a number of distinct formations. There's the Queen's Throne, which resembles an immense, high-backed chair. Standing nearby is a white stone formation that resembles a hound standing at attention. The formation was not carved but discovered by Civilian Conservation Corps workers in another part of the cave. It was moved to be near the throne, and given the nickname the Queen's Watchdog.",

          "description": "In Juab County, Utah, there is a natural cave that rivals man-made architectural wonders. This limestone and feldspar cavern was once filled by Lake Bonneville. Since 1956, the Bates family has curated the attraction for the Federal government and offers guided tours from their nearby ranch.\n\r\nThe story goes that the father of the family was out looking for his sheep in the hills and chanced upon a narrow opening in the rock. He uncovered a massive cavern that has, for years, sparked archaeological and geological debates as experts continue to study the cave. From prehistoric creatures to geological mysteries, visitors leave with a story that's millennia in the making.\n\r\nMinerals found in the cave range from common to rare. One mineral found in the cave, calcite iceland spar—also called \"optical calcite\"—is revered for its crystal clarity. Historically, it was used for various optical instruments, including the top secret Norden Bombsight of World War II.\n\r\nYou can get an authentic ranch-lodging experience in the Bates' custom cabins, which offer a respite from the Utah sun in a shaded grove of crabapples and grand trees. This land has been in their family since pioneers settled the land. \n\r\nSeveral miles from the ranch cabins is Gandy Warm Springs, which is publicly accessible via a gravel road. Clean, clear, and constantly 81 degrees, this oasis is the perfect place for a swim on a hot day or a soak in the cool evening twilight. Reeds and brush make the spring semi-private from the otherwise wide-open valley.",

The ferries were once common along the Rhine between the 1600s and 1800s, before being gradually replaced by bridges. Now, the Basel ferries are the only ones that remain in operation on this river.\n\r\nThe ferry is attached to a cable that joins the two riverbanks, and moves as the river current pushes against a rudder. The rudder is attached to a long bar, which the boat's driver swings to one side or the other depending on the direction of travel. The faster the current, the faster the trip--leaving your journey entirely up to the whims of the Rhine.\n\r\nSo, sit back and enjoy the relative silence of motorless boat travel and take in one of the most unique views in the city of Münster Cathedral.",

Getting off here, you'll find that the platforms are nothing unusual, but descend the steps into the dark, lonely concourse and walk into a world stuck in a different time.\n\r\nThe arched corridor was once home to a lantern-lit shopping street, full of izakaya life, but the last of the underpass bars closed down in 2022. Today, the remains of the shops and eateries sit empty or have been boarded up. Some ghost signs have been left behind on the much-graffitied walls. The arcade has become a dusty ruin in a perpetual state of photogenic near-abandonment.\n\r\nAt this murky tunnel's halfway, the underground corridor opens up into a narrow alleyway leading to the residential street outside. Only a few steps long, it's a jumbled-up confusion of veneer boards, corrugated plates, and bricks, plagued by a heavy layer of rust and vandalism here and there.\n\r\nOutside, up on the right-hand side of the western façade, you can also spot bullet holes left by the strafing gunfire from an Allied attack in 1945, a rare surviving example of World War II-era damage on the periphery of the Tokyo Metropolis.\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the station boasts an eclectic filmography spanning decades, used as a location by a number of films and TV dramas. The most notable works are Akira Kurosawa's Stray Dog (1949) and Hirokazu Kore-eda's Maborosi (1995).",

Stowing away on a ship carrying Christian missionaries from the West, this demigod of ambiguous origin arrived in Japan in the late 16th century and settled down in the town not long after.\n\r\nThough the raccoon dog stole food from local shops to live off, he did not cause much trouble otherwise and promised the townsfolk he would protect their cattle and horses and forewarn them of fires and burglaries. In return, the townsfolk built the shrine to honor him.\n\r\nBut how did he earn the epithet of “magic”? According to the historical texts in the local archives, this Mahō is a corruption of the name of a Buddhist goddess, Marici, with the hō “law, dharma” suffixed to it, unrelated to any magic.",

Today, there are over 170 such shops in the area, dealing in every kind of kitchenware from traditional dishes to chef uniforms, and vending machines to the world-famous food samples of Japan.\n\r\nEstablished in 1907, Niimi is one of the oldest companies based in Kappabashi, and its five-story building is considered an icon of the entire Kitchen Town, topped with a gigantic statue of a mustached chef officially named the \"Jumbo Cook.\"\n\r\nThe Jumbo Cook was installed in March 1982 when Niimi renovated its building, and stands  36 feet tall (11 meters). The company's unforgettable face has since spawned numerous urban legends, and according to the most popular (and ridiculous) rumor, it is actually a giant robot in disguise, the rest of its body hidden in the building, and will be activated when Tokyo faces a Godzilla-class danger.\n\r\nSome also believe that the colossal chef keeps a pigeon in each of his eyes. Zoom in to his face and you can see why: the irises are concave, and, inside them, white objects represent the light reflected in his eyes—and their shapes do resemble pigeons when seen from afar.",

It is a relatively simple stone structure, a polygonal chamber made up of six interlinked slabs with a seventh that forms a ceiling. It currently has no passageway or covering barrow, though this does not mean that it has always been that way.\n\r\nThe name Sorginetxe means \"witch's house\" in Basque, and is derived from a folk legend according to which it was built by witches who brought the stones down from the Sierra de Entzia Mountains by night on the distaffs of their spinning wheels. Other legends say that the witches lived at Fuente de Lezao in Eguileor, by the cave of the same name, and that they came to the dolmen to comb their hair.\n\r\nThe oldest known description of the structure dates back to 1833. Sorginetxe was partially excavated in 1890 by Julián de Apraiz, who found human remains and a barbed and tanged arrowhead. These finds have since disappeared. In 1913 it was purchased by the Provincial Council of Alava to ensure its conservation.",

The most visible legacy of Bisbee’s copper mining history is the Lavender Pit, visible from an overlook on the route between Bisbee and Historic Lowell.\n\r\nThe name of the pit may conjure up a beautiful sunset and shades of sandstone, but the pit is actually named for mining bigwig Harrison M. Lavender. Lavender was an engineer who rose through the ranks of the Calumet & Arizona Mining Co., which was acquired by the Phelps Dodge Corp., the company that owned Bisbee’s Copper Queen mines. Lavender believed that open-pit mining was the answer to getting more copper ore from Bisbee’s low-grade rock, replacing the existing Sacramento Hill mine. The pit mine opened in 1950. Sadly, Lavender was already dying at this point. He passed away in 1952, and the pit mine was named in his honor.\n\r\nThe pit remained in operation through 1974.It produced more than 600,000 tons of copper, and its expansion led to the demolition of Lowell’s residential district, turning its commercial area into an eerie ghost town. Most notably, it was the home of “Bisbee blue,” a form of uniquely high-quality turquoise. In 1972, Bob Matthews was given a lease to mine turquoise and mined nearly 2,000 pounds by 1974. By then, world copper prices had crashed, and Bisbee’s low-quality copper was an early casualty. Phelps Dodge left, the mines were scuttled and closed, and Bisbee was left for dead before reinventing itself years later.\n\r\nToday, the Lavender Pit is a popular tourist attraction for those headed to the border. Its turquoise remains rare, and is found in high-end galleries and mimicked in stores throughout town. Visitors to the overlook will be able to observe the pit and read interpretive signage explaining the history of the pit, and the meaning of the red, gray, yellow, and yes, lavender layers of rock that are now forever exposed to nature.",

When its team of academics made a report, it mentioned “strange holes” alongside the ripple marks.\n\r\nLater, in 1960, the “holes” were identified as dinosaur footprints, the first fossil track to be found in Japan. As it turned out, there were over 50 of them here. The new report attracted curious tourists to the site despite its remote location, receiving 30,000 visitors that year.\n\r\nFollowing this, Kanna started to brand itself as a “dinosaur kingdom,” opening a museum called the Kanna Dinosaur Center in 1987, exhibiting local fossils and Mongolian dinosaurs. Notably, it’s also home to specimens of the Sanchūryū, a previously unknown and understudied species of Gallimimus.\n\r\nThough the museum’s collection is rather impressive, the “dinosaur kingdom” of Kanna remains an obscure destination due to its difficult accessibility.

          "description": "Step into the annals of history and explore the captivating journey of Chimopar, the venerable cornerstone of Romanian chemical ingenuity. Created in 1895 under the visionary leadership of General Eremia Grigorescu, Chimopar, also known as Dudești Chemical Enterprise, rises as a time-honored emblem of innovation. Its legacy, steeped in the alchemy of creation and destruction, harkens back to an era when it stood tall as a vital producer of gunpowder and specialized compounds. It is currently a large, abandoned complex of several buildings that eventually became bankrupt, turning into a ruin in outer Bucharest.\n\r\nThe story is not without its tumultuous twists. Echoes of earthquakes and the resounding echoes of explosions, in 1904 and 1923 respectively, bear witness to the trials borne by this industrious bastion. Undeterred, it pressed forward, even as the Communist Regime cast its transformative shadow. The very fabric of Chimopar expanded under its influence, but the winds of change blew fiercely, ushering in the seismic shifts of 1989. As Romania's industrial landscape crumbled, Chimopar too fell victim to privatization in the 90s. It has since been left abandoned, explored by many who wish to see its old factory walls.\n\r\nToday, the factory's grounds offer a remarkable blend of contrasts, a canvas upon which history, art, and adventure converge. Once a hub of industrial fervor, it now beckons street artists and airsoft teams, calling upon hipsters and sports enthusiasts alike to use its space. In the symphony of decay and revival, a chorus of graffiti writers has given colour to the walls. With vibrant strokes, they have etched tales upon the slabs, each stroke an ode to the past's rewritten heartbeat. A magnetic allure draws many inquisitive adventurers captivated by the forgotten stories of Chimopar. The factory is worth a visit if you would like to understand both the history of the country and see something unique.",

          "description": "Located just three miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, Frontera Sculpture Oasis is a unique celebration of the Earth as envisioned by a singular artist working in the borderland near Columbus, New Mexico.\n\r\nThis fascinating sculpture garden is the work of Taras Mychalewych, a German emigre raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. After wandering through New Mexico for four days after his car blew up in the midst of a cross-country drive, he decided to move there and build a sculpture garden. He describes the park as infused with feminine energy, derived from the Mother of God (or Prajñāpāramitā), and Mother Earth. The message appears to be a tribute and appreciation to nature, and perhaps a warning to those who have defiled it in the name of profit.\n\r\nThe garden is nestled in the Chihuahuan desert, where agave and cholla mingle with the work. The oasis is explicitly inspired by the Watts Towers, and perhaps includes elements of other roadside outsider sculpture parks. Sculptural figures appear to be built out of scavenged or donated media, ranging from bricks to bottles. A makeshift biosphere mingles with sculptures crafted to mimic the shapes of the surrounding natural environment. A colorful display includes figures representing a regional mariachi band, welcoming people to the borderlands.",

          "description": "When you’re a kid, sometimes it feels like your home is the center of the universe. Well, in Chanute, Kansas, one Google software engineer named Dan Webb had the wherewithal to actually make that happen, and in turn, the town recognized his achievement through one of America’s oddest murals.\n\r\nThe story actually begins with the work of a different engineer, Brian McClendon, who was a co-founder of the company that eventually became the basis of Google Earth. McClendon was a Jayhawk through and through, and set the default location of Google Earth on PCs to center on his childhood home in Lawrence, Kansas, due to its relative proximity to the geographic center of the continental United States. Not to be outdone, Webb, a fellow Kansan who headed the Mac team, directed Google Earth to center instead on his hometown of Chanute.\n\r\nOrdinarily that’s where this anecdote would end, as it did in Lawrence, with an article in the paper and a cute Easter egg for aficionados. But Chanute took this claim to fame fiercely to heart, and created what may be the world’s most permanent screenshot. In 2010, the Chanute Area Chamber of Commerce commissioned a mural of the Google Earth display on Mac computers, and installed it in the center of the town’s busiest intersection. The map includes an outline of the United States of America, a giant star with Chanute, Kansas highlighted in the center, and a copyright verifying the screenshot.\n\r\nOf course, Google Earth has long since stopped defaulting to any single central location, and would not likely choose such an Amero-centric center point even if it did. However, the mural is still on display today, and banners displayed elsewhere in town make clear that Chanute is the center of Google Earth (on Mac computers). You can visit the mural when you’re in town, and if you’re not able to make it? Don’t worry. The mural is still visible on Google Earth.",

          "description": "There are only 18 examples of ancient stelae surviving from Japan’s classical antiquity, which roughly corresponds to the Early Middle Ages of the West. Located in the city of Takasaki, the Three Stelae of Kōzuke are the oldest of Japan’s stone inscriptions.\n\r\nThe Yamanoue Stele, the oldest of the three, has stood on a lonely hill since 681, from the Asuka period. It bears the oldest known example of an inscription written in Chinese characters and Japanese grammar. The andesite boulder is hardly worked, similar to the stelae of the Silla kingdom of Korea, and the calligraphic style seems to be a variation of the clerical script.\n\r\nThe inscription is as follows: “I inscribe this on the third day of the tenth moon, in the Year of the Snake and Pig. Kurome-no-toji, granddaughter of Takemori-no-mikoto, who governed the Sano-Miyake domain; this is a dedication from Chōri-no-hōshi to his mother, who bore him after marrying Ōgo-no-omi, son of Niikawa-no-omi son of Tatami-no-sukune. A monk of Hōkō-ji.”\n\r\nSimply put, the stele was erected by the monk Chōri-no-hōshi in memorial of his late mother, Kurome-no-toji, perhaps after burying her in the adjacent tomb.\n\r\nNow known as the Yamanoue tumulus, this well-preserved burial mound was originally built in the mid-6th century to entomb some local prince. It was, however, not an uncommon practice to drag the buried lords out of their resting places to make room for another person; it has been theorized that that’s what happened with the burial of Kurome-no-toji.\n\r\nThe tumulus is also a rare example of kofun, the ancient Japanese burial mound, as it is clear who is entombed and when it took place; most other sites do not provide such information. Together, the stele and the tumulus make for a fascinating trip of archaeological interest in an otherwise sleepy countryside.",

Some have said the monument sends a message that the Hungarians could do nothing to resist Nazi Germany and therefore are not to blame for the atrocities that occurred within Hungary. \n\r\nOthers criticized what they saw as an attempt to absolve the Horthy regime of blame for the terrors of WWII and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Hungarians.  At the time of the memorial's construction, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was accused of \"falsifying the Holocaust\" and \"confusing the murderer and the victim.\" \n\r\nIt was considered so controversial from the announcement of its development to mark the 70th anniversary of the occupation that its installation was completed in the middle of the night.\n\r\nIn Hungary, the Holocaust began years before the arrival of German soldiers, with pogroms, mass killings, deportations, and forced labor camps. Germany then got help from the Hungarian authorities in deporting 437,000 Jews in 1944.\n\r\nIn front of the memorial, you will find photos and messages left by the families of those killed during this dark period of Hungarian history, making the memorial even more poignant.",

In the midst of an arduous day of shearing sheep, the workers are rewarded with cups of tea, a spread of food, and cake.\n\r\nShearing cake, or cacen gneifo (pronounced \"c-ack-en guh-nigh-fo\") in Welsh, was traditionally made to celebrate Shearing Day. A simple, buttery sponge, the cake was studded with heady caraway seed, lemon rind, and candied citrus peel, and finished with a dusting of confectioners’ sugar.

          "description": "In the 1920s, Tulsa, Oklahoma, booming with oil money, built a thriving central downtown of glimmering gold-hued Art Deco buildings unlike those seen anywhere in the American West. However, one of the most striking buildings of this era was not a skyscraper at all, but rather a gas station designed to resemble the Hagia Sophia. A century later, this structure remains the center of Tulsa’s arts and nightlife scene, and the symbol of this offbeat and hardscrabble prairie city’s cultural revival.\n\r\nThe Blue Dome began its life as the White Star Service Station, designed by local architects Lawrence Blue and Fred L. Knoblock. The gas station was opened in January 1925 by Robert Chastain of Chastain Oil Co. At that time, it was Tulsa’s first full-service 24-hour filling station, with a service attendant who lived inside the dome. The next year, Route 66 opened, and the station's distinctive look made it a popular landmark until the route was adjusted in the early 1930s.\n\r\nIn the 1950s, the gas station closed its doors. The Blue Dome became the home of Veterans Bar until 1999, and has also hosted an antique store and other business. Currently, the Blue Dome is in private hands, owned by Jo and Chris Armstrong of the neighboring Arnie’s Bar.\n\r\nAlthough it is no longer open to the public, the Blue Dome has lent its distinctive name and visage to the entire neighborhood, now known as the Blue Dome Historic District. The dome has hosted art festivals and pop-up shops, and the bars and shops in the area frequently reference its appearance. Street lights, planting pots, and other civic fixtures now bear the color and shape of the iconic dome.",

He acquired cat music boxes, cat cookie jars, cat plates, cat art—even cat-inspired furniture. Eventually, Redner's collection became substantial enough that he and his wife Hilary decided that they wanted to share it with the public, so in 2020 they opened their home one day a month where people could come visit.\n\r\nAfter the local news picked up what they were doing, the Redners began receiving massive donations of cat figurines from people all over the country. Each donation is labeled with who and where it's from. Now their collection has about 3,500 cat items on display, with about that amount in storage as well.\n\r\nShawn and Hilary Redner are excited to show off the Mewseum to anyone who pays them a visit. Every room, wall, and space contains either cat figurines or something cat-related. They also have nine live cats complete with a custom-built outdoor enclosure to roam around.\n\r\nThe Mewseum takes donations at the door. All proceeds go towards local cat rescues. The Redners' goal is to eventually move everything into a larger space and open a cat cafe with the entire collection displayed.",

          "description": "In the heart of Paris on 7 rue Méchain, an architectural marvel by Robert Mallet-Stevens emerges, a unique apartment building designed in 1928-1929. Crafted at the request of Jean Deschamps, it remains hidden behind an unassuming street facade, a treasure trove of Mallet-Stevens' signature design elements which include spatial harmonies, innovative angles, and panoramic rooftop terraces. Its windows are exquisite, just like the interior, if you are ever given the chance to enter it.\n\r\nWithin its walls, the Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka found her creative haven. After moving to Paris in 1918, she embodied the Art Deco spirit with daring nudes and empowering portrayals of the modern woman. Her studio duplex apartment, a masterpiece itself, was home to her timeless works like The Sleeping Girl and Young Lady with Gloves. It occupied the second and third floors.\n\r\nWhile it is difficult to arrange a visit to the exact space she used as her atelier for 15 years, the building's interior called upon the collaboration of Louis Barrillet for stained glass, Jean Prouvé for metal railings, and the Atelier Jean Perzel for lighting, which makes this unassuming building absolutely stunning if you get the chance to even venture into the hallway.\n\r\nIn short, 7 rue Méchain tells the tale of an architectural symphony intertwined with the vibrant spirit of an artist ahead of her time. The building itself is an example of Art Deco architecture and gives a sense of the dazzling 1930s life. Although unassuming and rather hidden, it's a brilliant sight to understand Paris' role as a major art and culture center in Europe.",

          "description": "Following the end of the Tokugawa shogunate and its strict isolationist policy, the Meiji era of Japan (1868-1912) saw rapid modernization as it opened its borders to the West. The new government was ready to present itself as a modern nation by the 1880s, hosting grand balls and elaborate banquets for foreign guests.\n\r\nThe center of Japan’s Westernization is said to have been the Rokumeikan, an opulent two-story building completed in 1883. It was commissioned by Marquess Inoue Kaoru, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and designed by British architect Josiah Conder. Meant to be a symbol of modernization, the Rokumeikan soon became known for its French-style parties and banquets, the envy of the commoners.\n\r\nThe reactions to it were not all positive, however. Westerners were unimpressed and disappointed in its mediocre imitation of their culture while the Japanese conservatives considered it a place of outrageous debauchery. The so-called “Rokumeikan diplomacy” also failed to achieve Inoue’s desired goals of revising treaties in Japan’s favor, resulting in his resignation.\n\r\nThe Rokumeikan era only lasted from 1883 to 1887, and its influences are greatly exaggerated. Other state guest houses of the period and their parties are often confused with those held at the Rokumeikan, further mythicizing its legacies. In reality, after all, it was meant for accommodation rather than for parties.\n\r\nFrom 1890 to 1927 it was used by the Peers’ Club and then by a military insurance company, before getting demolished in 1940. Nothing much remains today, except for the staircase and wallpaper preserved at the University of Tokyo’s Faculty of Engineering and the chandelier housed at Tōmyō-ji Temple in Hirai, Edogawa Ward.\n\r\nOn the site, the main gate was preserved but was lost in the fires of World War II. Today, there is only an inconspicuous plaque marking the location of the legendary Rokumeikan, unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of the modern city.",

Born in 1506 in the Kingdom of Navarre, he co-founded the Jesuit Order in 1540 with Ignatius of Loyola and traveled the world as a Catholic missionary.\n\r\nFrom 1545 to 1552, the missionary was based on and off in the port of Portuguese Malacca (Melaka), where there now stands a 19th-century church named after him as well as a statue commemorating his visit. He died from a fever while on the way to China, and his body was carried back to Malacca for a temporary burial, before being shipped to Goa, India, in 1553.\n\r\nThe statue was erected in 1952 for the 400th anniversary of his last visit to Malacca. It stands in front of the hilltop ruins of St. Paul’s Church, where there is an open grave marking the site of Xavier’s temporary burial.\n\r\nAn interesting feature of this statue is his missing right hand, an attribute absent in most artistic depictions of the saint. This is because he had all of his limbs intact during his life—his right forearm, which he used to bless and baptize his converts, was only amputated after his death. It is said that it still bled when it was cut off.\n\r\nWhile his (mostly) incorruptible body rests in permanent peace in Velha Goa, the detached right hand was sent to Rome in 1614 and remains in a silver reliquary at the Il Gesù church, and portions of the relic are also displayed in Macau and Sydney.\n\r\nThough that’s the story with his right hand, some locals and tour guides of Malacca have a different version to tell. They claim that the statue did once have both hands in fact, but was struck by lightning one day and lost the right hand, perhaps by divine intervention.",

          "description": "At the turn of the 20th century, amusement parks known as White Cities were built across the United States. These were also known as trolley parks, since they were located on the trolley line and trolleys were the main form of transportation to and from the parks. One of these parks, Lakeside Amusement Park, was built outside of Denver in 1908.\n\r\nThrough good times and bad, Lakeside Amusement Park still stands and operates as it did over 100 years ago. Its crown jewel, the Tower of Jewels, no longer shines as brightly as it once did or even serves as the main entrance, but children of all ages can still have a fun time at the same park their great-great-grandparents may have enjoyed.\n\r\nA miniature railway can take you around Lake Rhoda for a scenic tour of Lakeside, Colorado. You may notice some abandoned or refurbished attractions. The entire park has been saved from the dustbin of history through some creative architectural salvage operations that have kept most, but not all of its rides operating.",

Due to this design, once one boat has entered the staircase it has committed to going through all the locks. The structure was built between 1803 and 1822 by Thomas Telford. The project was also designed to provide jobs to residents of the Highlands.\n\r\nEach of the current lock gates weighs 22 tons. A team of at least three lock-keepers is needed to operate the staircase. The staircase usually operates on an efficient basis.\n\r\nThe system was originally hand-powered but has been converted to hydraulic power. In the past, the locks were operated by capstans, each with four poles that made seven full revolutions to open and close each gate. Each gate was operated by two capstans, one to open and another to close. Transit times through the staircase have been reduced from just over half a day to 90 minutes with the conversion to hydraulic rams and push-button controls.\n\r\nVisitors can still see the plinths where the original capstans were anchored, but the capstans themselves have been removed.",

This particular instrument was designed for the purpose of extinguishing thatched roof fires. For much of history, prior to the advent of firefighters, communities relied upon their neighbor's help to fight fires. This is where the thatch hook came into play, as it was used to drag the burning thatch from the roof of the cottage to prevent the fire from spreading. The huge hook required several individuals to wield it effectively.\n\r\nBeneath the thatch hook, there are two additional items on display. The first is a brass plaque commemorating the coronation of Edward VII in 1902, while the second is a \"mantrap\" used on private property to discourage intruders and poachers, a reminder of the harsh realities of life during the 18th century.\n\r\nToday, the thatch hook serves as a relic of the past, as there are no longer any thatched roofs in Ivinghoe. Nevertheless, it remains a fascinating artifact that offers a glimpse into the unique challenges faced by communities during a bygone era.",

          "description": "This spooky subterranean grotto ballroom is called the Rathskeller. Located in Louisville's Seelbach Hotel, it's the only surviving room in the world completely encrusted in Rookwood pottery, from stem to stern, and has a powerfully creepy vibe.\n\r\nThe Bavarian-style Rathskeller Room was constructed of Rookwood Pottery in 1907. A unique work of art and the only room of its kind in the world that’s still intact, this room is an ornate, preserved part of American history. The decorations of the room were drawn by hand on the clay before firing; the design was a part of the ware. After baking, various glazes were added in subsequent firings. A portion of the ceiling is made of leather and was painted with intricate designs (including the 12 signs of the zodiac).\n\r\nAl Capone is said to have used secret tunnels in and out of the place as part of his organized crime operation. When F. Scott Fitzgerald was a young soldier stationed at Camp Zachary Taylor, he came into Louisville and was a frequent visitor at the Seelbach Hotel's subterranean bar. The time Fitzgerald spent there allegedly inspired parts of The Great Gatsby.\n\r\nThe hotel is also chock-full of ghost stories. Its most infamous ghost is known as the \"Lady in Blue,\" said to be the spirit of a young woman who died in one of the hotel's elevator shafts.",

A section of this history is showcased in Geneva's Musée d'Histoire des Sciences (Museum of History of Science), where the developments made between the 17th and 19th centuries are showcased alongside additional more modern tools. \n\r\nIn the past, science was largely an occupation for the elite, meaning that those who practiced it were either rich enough to afford it or had patrons who could pay them to pursue it. This means that everything up to their equipment was often very well made, also in a way that made the instruments pleasing to the eye besides just functional. This makes them the ideal tool to explain science with, as important parts were often laid bare for show rather than covered to be protected.\n\r\nMany of those instruments are on display in the museum, tools that were used in the fields of astronomy, microscopy, gnomonics, electricity, meteorology, and measuring in general.",

          "description": "In the town of Prrenjas, situated in eastern Albania, a once-dilapidated industrial relic has been transformed into a captivating landmark. Artist Eljan Tanini took a pair of abandoned nickel mining towers—vestiges of Albania's failed industrial aspirations under communist rule—and transformed them with an astonishing 1,380 ladybugs. Symbolizing femininity and good fortune, these ladybugs are a vibrant nod to the town's female mayor and its broader identity.\n\r\nDuring the rule of communist leader Enver Hoxha, Albania underwent a period of intense industrialization while being cut off from the rest of the world. This left a legacy of aging factories, bunkers, and mining facilities scattered across the country. Since the fall of communism, these structures have largely been abandoned, standing as solemn monuments to a repressive past. However, art projects like the one in Përrenjas demonstrate the potential for turning these sites into symbols of renewal and hope.\n\r\nThe project was completed in just 22 days and features eco-friendly paint. The mining towers themselves go more than 300 meters underground. Additionally, a tree has sprouted 52 meters up on one of the towers, offering a striking symbol of nature's resilience.\n\r\nAs you traverse the intriguing landscape of Albania, a stop in Prrenjas offers a unique chance to witness this extraordinary confluence of industrial decay and contemporary artistic vision. Through initiatives like this, artists are helping to redefine Albania's historical scars as canvases for cultural expression, showing that even in the most unlikely places, there's room for beauty and change.",

This acknowledgment not only validates the art created on these walls but also nurtures a profound sense of belonging among the individuals who have rejuvenated its premises. Alongside its varied non-profit offerings, the venue hosts music performances, film screenings, and communal gatherings.\n\r\nWhether you’re a culture enthusiast or someone seeking an immersive urban adventure, Bolsjefabrikken offers an ever-shifting and thought-provoking experience.

          "description": "The Halte Royal d'Ardennes (the Royal Train Stop of the Ardennes) was a private train stop built for King Leopold II of Belgium and linked to the royal family's summer residence, Château royal d'Ardenne. Court architect Alphonse Balat designed the opulent residence, which was completed in 1891. Guests and royalty would use the private train stop to visit the château, which also featured extensive gardens designed by the Paris-based landscape architect Elie Lainé.\n\r\nWithin a few years, Leopold II decided to repurpose the residence into a luxury hotel. Wealthy guests from Belgian, French, and English began to visit the hotel via the train. The hotel featured every luxury amenity of the time: running water, bathrooms, electrical lights, and even a telephone. \n\r\nBoth the train station and the hotel were shuttered during World War I after sustaining some damage. \n\r\nThe hotel and train stop briefly reopened after being restored and expanded after the war. But then, during World War II, both suffered further damage. Finally, in 1968, the hotel burned down and the train stop was abandoned. (It's not the only abandoned royal Belgian train station, either.)\n\r\nDespite this, the train stop is still an impressive ruin with its watch tower and stone walls. Surrounded by the River Lesse on one side and the woods and hills of the Belgian Ardennes on the other, the dilapidated station looks more like something out of a fairytale.\n\r\nA special architectural feature is the cobblestone driveway, spiraling out from the platform and around a central courtyard. You don't need much imagination to see the coaches lined up, waiting to pick up the VIPs of their time.",

          "description": "Soutra Aisle was a medieval hospital, a place of refuge for wayfarers and pilgrims, one that welcomed the needy or elderly as well as the sick and infirm. It also acted as a place of sanctuary for fugitives. It stands midway between Edinburgh and the rich Borders abbeys on the Via Regia or Royal Highway, the main Anglo-Scottish road for the medieval period. This spot was originally the place where five roads met, which ensured a regular flow of people in need.\n\r\nSoutra Aisle was first mentioned in 1164 after King Malcolm IV confirmed the foundation of the charter. The hospital was run by the Augustinian Order, funded by the income from the large hospital estate. Despite being located in a war zone up until 1320, Soutra Aisle continued to grow. It eventually covered an area of 700 square meters, and became one of the three most important hospitals in Scotland at the time.\n\r\nSoutra Aisle was of both national and international importance up until the 1460s, when it experienced a rapid decline. Soutra Aisle lost its lands, which caused an almost instant loss of funds that was devastating to the hospital. The estate was confiscated and handed to the Trinity College Hospital in Edinburgh because the Master of the Hospital, Stephen Fleming was accused of misconduct.\n\r\nIt only survived because it became the burial vault of the Pringle family. This new purpose saved the church from the same fate as the rest of the site, which saw its stone carted away and repurposed in nearby building projects.\n\r\nArchaeological excavations have turned up rare seeds, sourced from all over the world, that were used for their medicinal properties, including opium poppies, cloves, and hemlock.",

          "description": "In 1885, an act of Parliament made the Manchester Ship Canal possible. Within the act, there were around 300 pages of technical requirements included to satisfy landowners along the 36-mile route.\n\r\nOne of those requirements was for a \"ferry by night and by day whenever required\" to be maintained by the canal's owners to replace Hulmes Bridge, a low-lying bridge that connected the villages of Flixton and Irlam.\n\r\nOriginally serviced by rear-oared scull boats, the free Hulmes Ferry is still in operation today with the Peel Group now responsible for its maintenance. The boat is harbored on the Flixton side of the river, so those crossing from the Irlam side need to ring a bell to get the ferryman's attention.\n\r\nThe crossing takes just under a minute to complete, with a limit of four passengers onboard.\n\r\nSimilar rights of way across the canal can be found upriver, with the Thelwall Ferry providing a similar service for the small cost of 11p, and the Warburton Toll Bridge costing 12p to travel over. The original 1885 act didn't allow for inflation to be calculated into the ferry cost, hence some highly affordable ferries outside of Manchester.",

One of the best-known examples is found in Los Angeles, while Mexico City has a pair of its own.\n\r\nThe first of these was gifted in 2010 and can be found in the Parque Bicentenario (Bicentennial Park), on the city's northwest. The other, donated two years later, is located more centrally, right in front of the well-known Mothers' Monument. Both are smaller than the original, although still impressive in their dimensions. Weighing nearly one ton, the bronze bells are four feet (1.4 meters) tall and with a diameter of 80 centimeters.\n\r\nDespite the two-year difference between their giftings, these two bells were given by the South Korean government in order to celebrate the centennial of the start of the Mexican Revolution, and the bicentennial of the start of the War of Independence, both commemorated in 2010.\n\r\nThe 2012 date is also appropriate as it represented 50 years since diplomatic relations between South Korea and Mexico were established.

          "description": "Nothing washes ashore here but seaweed and bones. The island is Inishtrahull, or Inis Trá Tholl in Irish, which roughly translates as \"island of the hollow beach,\" Ireland's most northerly island. Though uninhabited now, it once had a small resident community for many years. As rural a life you could live was the islanders who once called Inishtrahull home.\n\r\nA low plateau sits in the middle of the island, bookended by two rocky pinnacles. The southern of those high points is home to the Inishtrahull Lighthouse, first built in 1813. For a time, lighthouse keepers, fishermen, and their families made up a small community that mostly occupied the plateau in the central part of the island. At its peak in 1911, there were 80 residents living on the remote island.\n\r\nOver time, fishing by large trawlers depleted the stock in the waters around Inishtrahull. People started leaving the island, and the remaining residents evacuated in 1929. In the following decades, only a lighthouse keeper called the small island home. A new lighthouse was built in the 1950s, and when it was automated a few decades later the island was left without any residents at all.\n\r\nThere are no trees or hedges. But its abundance of nature flowers and fauna make it the perfect location for seabirds, and the tidal sound makes it an attractive stopping point for grey seals. The island has been designated as an area of special conservation interest.\n\r\nToday, the center of the island is scattered with ruins of old stone cottages and the school masters house and school. There is also a small graveyard. And the shell of the old lighthouse 1812 watches over its sister lighthouse, which claims the title of Ireland's most northernmost lighthouse. For many emigrating from Ireland, it was the last bit of home they saw on their journey to the United States. “Inishtrahull lighthouse off the coast of Donegal was the last glimpse emigrants would have of Ireland,\" according to the account of one of those emigrants. \"Everyone stayed on deck until it disappeared.”",

It is around 114 feet (35 meters) long and consists of more than 1,000 carved stones. This is the creation of a local artist named Remo Ponti, who can often be found on-site creating new artwork.\n\r\nPonti was a metalworker by training and profession, but his true calling was art. In 2014, he decided to turn a rural stone wall into a work of art, and it took him six years to complete.\n\r\nThe themes of these carved stones are as varied as they can be—animals, faces, everyday objects, geometric patterns, and abstract compositions. As Ponti unravels the symbolism behind each stone, it becomes clear that these stones are the repository of his life experience, emotions, and philosophy. \n\r\nA wide face on a stone may represent the executioner who lost his job following the invention of the guillotine, but he rejoices at the occasional chance of wielding his axe again. On another stone is the wing of a butterfly, with a minuscule stylized human figure on the side, representing the artist facing the beauty and complexity of the natural world, and ultimately, the universe. Contemplating the variety of themes on the wall is as gratifying as learning about their hidden meaning. Ponti manufactured all the different chisels and hammers that he used to create his art.",

However, there is one home that seems to stick out considerably from the rest. Although it may appear out of place, this house has long been here before the others and has the distinction of being the oldest continuously occupied home in the United States.\n\r\nThe house was owned by Deane Winthrop, the sixth son of John Winthrop who the town is named after. The house was originally built in 1637 by Captain William Pierce and acquired by Deane in 1647. It was remodeled and rebuilt several times with the current structure dating to around 1675 with an addition later added in 1696.\n\r\nToday, the home is owned by the Winthrop Improvement and Historical Association and houses a wide array of historical artifacts such as a 1641 Bible written in classical Greek, dishes from China ordered in 1775, a Springfield musket made in 1823, and an assortment of furniture hundreds of years old. But it still serves as a private residence the same as it did almost 350 years ago from Puritans, Minuteman, and homeowners today.\n\r\nIf you have an interest in early American history and would like to see the oldest still lived-in home in the country, the Deane Winthrop House is certainly worth a visit.",

Arnold, still years away from becoming the nation's most infamous traitor, sacrificed several vessels in what would be called the Battle of Valcour Island, after one of the islands dotting the narrow, deep lake that stretches from Québec south along the New York-Vermont border. The clash ended in defeat for Arnold, but bought valuable time for the Continental Army.\n\r\nThe Spitfire was among the ships lost as Arnold and his men retreated—but it was not the end of the story for the gunboat.\n\r…",

The name comes from the Irish \"An Cionn Ban\" meaning \"white head,\" a reference to the craggy limestone rocks the castle sits atop.  Brave visitors who descend the cliff path can view spectacular cliffs, explore the ruins, and view Rathlin Island across the water.\n\r\nKinbane Castle was built in 1547 by Colla MacDonnell, of the Scottish clan of MacDonnell, lords of the Western Isles of Scotland. The only access point was by climbing down the basalt cliff face, as the castle was nearly impossible to access via the sea. Little written documentation remains to detail the history of the castle, though an information panel near the ruins gives visitors a tour of the remaining elements and sheds light on how the castle may have looked.\n\r\nThe castle changed hands over the centuries with local tradition suggesting it may have been inhabited until the 18th century. According to one of the NIEA plaques, test excavations at the site in 2011 did not find anything dating later than the 16th century.",

The hill is known for its iconic temple complex, museum, memorial, and cave.\n\r\nOn the top of the hill, between the Devdeveshwar Temple and the Peshwa Museum, in a beautiful garden stands a more-than-300-year-old living witness of history. It's a huge White Frangipani tree (Plumeria rubra). The tree is also known as Temple Tree, Dev Chaph, or Pandhra (White) Chapha.\n\r\nThe frangipani tree is not native to India and is found in Mexico and Central America. According to historians, the Portuguese brought the tree along with them and first planted these trees in Goa, followed by the Konkan region, and later, Pune. Across India, these trees can be commonly seen planted next to temples.\n\r\nNanasaheb Peshwa built this temple complex in 1749. Historians believe that the Chapha tree has existed on this hill since before the temple was constructed and may be the oldest tree in the city.\n\r\nThe tree is a beautiful sight to behold. It stands tall in a tranquil courtyard surrounded by the peace of the temple. It has witnessed centuries of the city’s history and is now under the care of the temple trust and authorities.",

          "description": "War can leave behind strange legacies. One such odd creation is the existence of Via Ferrata, or \"iron path,\" a system of steel rungs and cables built into the side of mountains.\n\r\nDuring World War I in the Dolomites mountains of Italy, the mountainous peaks became the heated site of battle between the Austro-Hungarians and Italians. Fixed lines of steel cable were installed to help transport goods so climbers could clip into the lines and be less afraid of falling to their deaths. It was a brutal, icy, battle on those mountains, with soldiers freezing, starving, and falling to their deaths when they weren't being shot at or blown up. However, after the fighting was done, the Via Ferrata remained, ready for adventurous climbers to clip in.\n\r\nDecades later, during World War II, and halfway around the world in West Virginia, the 10th Mountain Division was training to fight on very similar terrain in the Apennines of Italy. To do so, they used the closest analog they could find: Nelson Rocks.\n\r\nThe Nelson Rocks, situated in the Monongahela National Forest, are famous for their two fins, thin ridges of rock bursting up 800 feet above the streams running through the forest below. Built in 2002, by private owner Stu Hammett, the Via Ferrata is one of only three found on the east coast of the United States.\n\r\nClimbers go up over 1000 feet of elevation and cross a 200-foot-long suspension bridge on the trip. One of the real draws of Via Ferrata is that it allows non-climbers to take routes, and access heights that would otherwise be too dangerous or technical for them.",

In Newton, Kansas, a group of talented artists have created a majestic sculpture to harness and evoke this feeling of the expansive sky.\n\r\nCompleted in 2001, the Blue Sky Sculpture was created “to blend with the natural sky,” as a plaque at the viewing stand suggests, which “requires a patient and contemplative viewer.”\n\r\nPainter Phil Epp worked with ceramicists Terry Corbett and Conrad Snider to create an arced and undulating structure, where the cobalt blue glaze of the ceramic tiles and fluffy white painted clouds reflect the color of the sky throughout the day. Viewers are encouraged to stand in between the sculptures, in what is known as the “sky passageway.” To complete the motif, two giant abstract stoneware figures stand next to the sculpture, further encouraging interactivity.\n\r\nThe sculpture was donated by local philanthropist and inventor Lloyd E. Smith in memory of his wife, Jacqueline, and has since become a symbol of the community, inspiring further designs and being named one of the Eight Wonders of Kansas Art.",

Since 1948, Oklahoma City has displayed its beacon of dairy goodness to thirsty travelers making their way across the Mother Road. \n\r\nThe wedge-shaped red brick building was already an unusual sight on Classen Boulevard when it was built in 1930, as it was one of Oklahoma City’s few triangular lots. At the time, Classon Boulevard was part of Route 66 itself, and the grocery building would be a stop on the streetcar line that ran along the street. In 1948, the milk bottle was added, as a prime example of roadside mimetic architecture, where it has stood ever since. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\r\nCuriously, the building and the milk bottle have always been separate establishments. The building itself, with its unusual size and foot traffic, has hosted several businesses, including a banh mi shop, a barbecue shack, a design studio, and a private nail salon. Likewise, the milk bottle has had a number of different dairy companies adorn it as an advertisement. Currently, the milk bottle bears the logo of Braum’s, the beloved Okie dairy farm, grocery, and fast food chain that has stores across the state.",

          "description": "In the 2013 reality television series Konstkuppen (translated as “The Art Coup”), six well-known artists in six different Swedish cities had six days to collaborate with locals in order to create a new public art piece. One of the participants was artist and comedian Peter Apelgren. He chose Osby, the hometown of his mother-in-law, as the location for crafting his artwork, Apan och Kaninen (\"The Bunny and Monkey\"), and enlisted the help of local artist Sven-Ingvar Johansson, who is an expert in carving animal figures with chainsaws.\n\r\nTowering at 15 feet (4.5 meters) and constructed from cellular plastic and fiberglass cloth, the animal figures were modeled after two of Apelgren’s childhood toys. The artist wanted to make something \"kind and childlike\" as a nod to renowned toy manufacturer BRIO, which was based in Osby for over 100 years and runs a popular toy museum in town. \n\r\nWhile some locals found the colossal animal duo comical and jokingly called it Sweden's modern answer to the Easter Island statues, others thought the large sculptures ruined the scenic lakefront and that they should be moved to a playground instead. \n\r\nAfter being vandalized a few times, the artwork was eventually set on fire one summer night in 2013. As a result, the monkey figure was reduced to ashes and the rabbit figure was scorched. However, thanks to local businesses and the Municipality of Osby, the animal pair was restored and re-inaugurated two years later.",

Live complex, just steps from the arena where the Grammy Awards are most often held. The second, naturally, is located in the small town of Cleveland, Mississippi, two hours away from the nearest big city.\n\r\nSo… what are artifacts from the most famous pop music stars and a massive museum with interactive exhibits doing in a place like Cleveland? There are a few answers. The answer the Grammy Museum Mississippi offers is that Cleveland is located in the Mississippi Delta, as one of a string of music museums dotting the landscape of the cradle of American music along the Mississippi Blues Trail between Memphis and Jackson. Additionally, the proximity to Delta State University gives it an educational function. A more cynical answer may have to do with the flow of economic development funding to Mississippi in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and how much of it was used on major white elephant projects instead of direct aid to its residents.\n\r\nEither way, the GRAMMY Museum Mississippi is a striking 28,000-square-foot building that combines L.A. glitz with Delta architectural vernacular. Exhibits include outfits worn by popstars including Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Charli XCX, and more, alongside exhibits of blues greats such as Bobby Rush and local legend B.B. King. \n\r\nA special spotlight is placed on Mississippi music legends from Jimmie Rodgers through today, including Elvis Presley, who was born in Tupelo. Finally, the museum includes films, theatrical presentations, and a soundstage and studio, with interactive exhibits on the blues to help you hone your skills on your way to a Grammy nomination of your own.",

          "description": "Finchale Priory was founded in 1196 upon the site of St. Godric's Hermitage. Originally a sailor, although some would say a pirate, St. Godric visited Lindisfarne, where he underwent a religious conversion and gave up a life on the seas to devote his life to religion. (Godric was never formally canonized, so the term \"saint\" is a bit of a misnomer.)\n\r\nFollowing a long illness, perhaps brought on by the hardship of his self-imposed ascetic lifestyle which included sleeping outdoors in all weather, Godric died in 1170. After his death, two monks were sent to occupy the hermitage. \n\r\nThe main buildings of the priory date to 1237, and the church was completed in 1277. It didn't become a priory in its own right after Henry du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham's son was convinced to bestow upon it sa…",

The replica oil well found in this small Kansas town is a symbol of the discovery that reshaped America.\n\r\nThe commercial petroleum industry got its start in 1859 in Pennsylvania, and eventually enterprises were set up across the Appalachian basin. By the 1890s, rumors of glowing gas springs that abounded in southeast Kansas led local citizens to encourage William Mills, a Pennsylvania oil prospector, to come to town to supply natural gas to the residents of Neodesha. \n\r\nAfter surveying several plots of land, Mills eventually chose the four-acre garden of local blacksmith T.J.

Ever since a colossal bone from the find has been on display within the historic church.  \n\r\nThis church is one of two churches in Warsaw dedicated to St. Anne. The church with the mammoth bone, St. Anne's Church or Kościół św. Anny, is in the city center: The second church, the Belfry at St. Anne, is in in the historic Wilanów district where King John III Sobieski of Poland's Wilanów Palace is located. The two churches mark the beginning and end of the Royal Route, which connects the Royal Castle with Wilanów Palace.\n\r\nInitially, the 14th-century Church of St. Leonard stood on this site. Later, in 1772, Prince August Adam Czartoryski commissioned architect Jan Kotelnicki to rebuild the church using bricks in a Neoclassical style. It was during this second phase of construction that the mammoth skeleton was discovered. The newly renovated church was renamed St. Anne's Church.\n\r\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the church was renovated in a Neo-Rennaisance style by Enrico Marconi, Leonardo Marconi, and Jan Huss. Sculptor Bolesław Syrewicz also made sculptures to dot the church's façades and the wall decorations were added by Antoni Kolberg.\n\r\nThe church survived both World Wars with minimal damage, and today is one of Warsaw's oldest buildings.",

          "description": "The 1968 Tlatelolco Massacre is almost certainly the best-known case of the country's government reacting with deadly force to student protests, but it was not the last one. Just three years later on June 10, the Feast of Corpus Christi, a paramilitary group known as Los Halcones (The Hawks) repressed another student protest in Mexico City, with around 120 victims. Due to the date and perpetrators, this would come to be known as both the Halconazo and Corpus Christi Massacre.\n\r\nAs had been the case in the entire country's modern democracy, and up to 2000, the ruling party was the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). At the time, the authorities maintained that the Halcones were an independent organization. In the following years however, direct connections were established between the group and the PRI, several institutions of the Mexico City government, and even the CIA, as there have been suspicions that they assisted in their training. This goes to show that, even as a paramilitary organization, the Halcones enacted the massacre under the auspices of the city and national authorities.\n\r\nForty years later, this sculpture was installed outside the city's Escuela Normal (Teaching School) as this was the alma mater of many of the victims of the massacre. Its sculptor, Enrique Carbajal (known as Sebastián), was actually arrested and held in a military prison in 1968, so his role as the artist behind this piece is symbolic. Additionally, he has often been commissioned for public artworks, usually in a signature monochrome, abstract style.\n\r\nThe 2011 sculpture, which might be officially titled Sangre Derramada (\"Spilled Blood\"), although this is unclear, represents several elements related to the massacre. At the bottom, a Christian cross ties the monument to the Corpus Christi date. Atop, glyphs similar to those used by the country's pre-Columbian cultures are piled up to form a 15-meter-tall structure. The monument is completed by a plaque listing the names of 40 of the victims of that day.",

It holds great cultural and historical significance as one of the city's most iconic landmarks, holding nostalgic value for many people who remember its role as a luxurious meeting place in Yugoslavia. What's more, it was visited by a plethora of highly renowned international celebrities, politicians, athletes, and artists since its construction, including Queen Elizabeth II, Richard Nixon, Neil Armstrong, and Belgian and Dutch royals.\n\r\nAfter it was built in 1969, the hotel quickly became a symbol of the modernization and progress of Yugoslavia. It was designed by a team of prominent Yugoslav architects led by Lavoslav Horvat, and features a distinctive Brutalist architectural style on the banks of the Danube. Over the years, the hotel has undergone renovations to update its facilities and amenities while preserving its architectural character.\n\r\nIn its heyday, it was a five-star hotel, laced with chandeliers and lavish silver and gold elements, but today it is a more affordable three-star hotel that offers a range of comfortable accommodations. It is without a doubt that the hotel has faced challenges and changes over the years such as being severely damaged in the NATO bombing of the 90s. It will, however, eternally remain a recognizable symbol of Belgrade's history and architectural heritage. \n\r\nToday, Hotel Jugoslavija continues to welcome guests from around the world, offering a blend of modern comforts, historic charm, and beautiful riverfront views. It serves as a reminder of the city's past, with many solemn documentaries such as Hotel Yugoslavia (2017) having been filmed about the once full-of-life hotel in the quaint neighborhood of Zemun.",

Fuchs renamed Ice Cave the Fox Cave, pronounced like his last name. The store was a popular roadside stop along Highway 70 through the 1950s, but its legacy faded over time.\n\r\nThe site had been long abandoned when Arnold Duke, a gemologist and proprietor of the nearby Ruidoso River Museum, purchased it in 2010. Putting some care into its rehabilitation, the site has reopened as a mid-century style tourist trap, although one with an unusually strong gem collection.

          "description": "Ting1, completed in 2013 in Örnsköldsvik, is one of Sweden’s most remarkable residential buildings, captivating with its vibrant colors, distinctive architecture, and innovative construction. Its façade of glazed high-gloss ceramics stands in striking contrast to the gray brutalist concrete of the 1967 courthouse it sits on top of.\n\r\nThe new building appears perched on the courthouse’s roof, yet no physical contact exists between the two structures due to a discreetly positioned 26-foot by 26-foot base in the old building’s courtyard, creating a clever architectural composition reminiscent of a substantial mushroom with its stem securely anchored within the enclosed plaza.\n\r\nDesigned by acclaimed architect Gert Wingårdh, Ting1 boasts 11 floors and a façade featuring 78 glass balconies offering stunning views of the High Coast region’s landscape, including the iconic ski jumping hills. This design contributes to the building’s artistic vibrancy, drawing inspiration from a pixelated version of the late regional artist Bengt Lindström’s oil painting Women's Dance.\n\r\nTing1, called \"the LEGO house\" or \"the Coronavirus\" by some locals, stirs both acclaim and controversy. It was a finalist for the Swedish Building of the Year 2014 award and won the Great Tile Award that year. However, differing opinions emerged, labeling it as \"Ångermanland Province's ugliest building\" in a local 2016 poll, and it was critically spotlighted by the Arkitektupproret (Architectural Uprising) movement, which fights against modernism. This mix of accolades and critiques vividly shapes Ting1's unique standing in architectural discussions.",

In 1934, the Iranian government under the Pahlavi dynasty commissioned the reconstruction of his mausoleum, which would be completed 31 years later.\n\r\nDesigned by the architect Hooshang Seyhoun, the new Omar Khayyam Mausoleum is an outstanding beauty many consider a masterpiece of modern Persian architecture.

Most of all, we saw a lot of birds: startling close-ups, in magnificent mid-flight, and congregating en masse with their feathered friends.\nCheck out the delightful winning photos (click to see them up close) selected by our staff—the first place winner is above. We hope these images will endear you to the living beings we share the world with.\n\r\nCongratulations to our winners, who scored some Atlas Obscura gear!

Kielce, a city in southern Poland, is no different, though their story certainly is quite unique. A statue on the town square depicts a large imposing boar, which is situated on top of a pedestal and surrounded by six brass plates that tell its story.  \n\r\nThe story centers around Prince  Mieszko Bolesławowic, son of the 11th-century Polish King Bolesław II. The prince was sent out into the woods with a large army escort on a hunting trip after the king got into an argument with the Bishop of Krakow and feared for his son's life in retaliation.  \n\r\nIn the woods, the prince and his men found and slayed many beasts, while living an otherwise unremarkable life. That is until one day, when Prince Mieszko saw a giant boar and decided to follow it on his own. This nearly ended in tragedy as he drove into a branch and was knocked out cold.\n\r\nWhile he was unconscious, the prince dreamt that someone had given him poison and that he was dying. However, just before the end Saint Wojciech appeared and healed the prince with cleansing water that appeared from a spot below his cane. The prince woke up to discover that he had been found and helped by his men. To his surprise, he also saw the river from his dreams, and also a pair of large boar tusks (Kły) on the place where he was knocked out. \n\r\nHe decided to build a city here on this holy spot, and called it after the boar's tusks: Kielce.",

For more than 50 years, Otto has stood sentry over Grotto Lake, as the beloved mascot of the city.\n\r\nLike most great works of art, Otto began his life as a high school shop project, the brainchild of shop teacher Tom Willett, who wanted to create something special for Fergus Falls’s centennial in 1972. Unfortunately, the first version of Otto was…an otter disaster. Steve Jaenisch, a metal artist who went on to create a number of sculptures around town, finished the job and made sure Otto would last for generations to come.\n\r\nToday, the 40-foot-long otter sculpture stands proudly in Adams Park, overlooking the lake. The quaint city park also includes a ballfield, a playground, and picnic tables, including one that is often placed tantalizingly close to Otto.",

          "description": "This water storage facility, which also controls Bangor’s water pressure, has been in use since 1897. It also inspired a piece of Stephen King's 1986 novel It: the standpipe in Derry, where Stan first encounters Pennywise.\n\r\nBangor’s most famous resident Stephen King once lived a few blocks away from the standpipe. According to him, he also wrote a significant portion of his book It in the shadow of the standpipe. In the early 1980s, he would walk down the street, sit on a park bench in the small park beneath the standpipe, and write the book. It is said that the tragic stairwell death of the boy in 1940 influenced the creation of the book’s character Pennywise the Clown.\n\r\nThere are no recorded drowning accidents in the standpipe, but for anyone who has read the book or seen either the film or the miniseries, this is an incredibly eerie place to be—even though you’re just staring at an old water tower. Which tells you everything you need to know about the power of King’s writing.\n\r\nIn the 2017 remake of the movie It, one of the characters bikes by a standpipe in the fictional town of Derry, which is King’s thinly disguised version of Bangor. The standpipe was CGI-generated and the movie was filmed in Toronto. There are also references to the standpipe in his other books Dreamcatcher and 11/22/63.",

There is no sign or even a path to get to the sculpture, but you can see it on the east side of the street. You’ll need to walk up a small hill and then through grasslands to get to the sculpture.\n\r\nThere is very little else around in Last Chance, Colorado, so there’s a part of this whole adventure that feels like one has come upon this hidden art creation that no one else knows about.",

With a high point at San Jacinto Peak (10,804 feet/3,294 meters), the range is tall enough to intercept the moisture coming from the Pacific, such that the higher elevations support forests and even a winter snow cap. However, this also causes a rain-shadow desert on the eastern side of the range. The mountain precipitation feeds a number of perennial streams that drain to the east, of which one of the largest is Tahquitz (pronounced TAH-keets) Creek.\n\r\nThe creek drops steeply down the eastern front of the range through a spectacular canyon, from which it formerly flowed out into the desert where the city of Palm Springs now sits. As with any desert creek, its water was of paramount importance for wildlife and the local human population.\n\r\nNear the base of the range, where its grade flattens out, the creek flows over a picturesque waterfall some 60 feet high that can be reached by a footpath. The path runs about 1.8 miles through a scenic desert canyon with an altitude gain of 350 feet. The level is moderate and should be within the capabilities of most hikers. Some rock art is also visible. The creek and falls both lie within the Agua Caliente Cahuilla Reservation and the tribe sells hiking permits.\n\r\nTahquitz, in the local Native American lore, was a malevolent spirit that dwelled in the mountains.",

He ventured into the Alaskan bush in 1992 with minimal supplies, hoping to live off the land. Eventually, McCandless came across an abandoned bus near the Sushana River that he used as a makeshift shelter. It would also become his final resting place. \n\r\nIn 1996, Jon Krakauer published Into The Wild, a book following McCandless's journey that became an international bestseller. In 2007, the book was adapted into a movie directed by Sean Penn and starring Emile Hirsch as McCandless.

But after at least 15 people had to be rescued and two people died attempting to cross the Teklanika River, the bus was airlifted out in June 2020. It was moved to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where there are plans to put it on display at the Museum of the North.",

It was here on April 28, 1930, that the first night game was played in the history of organized baseball.\n\r\nIt’s important to define \"organized baseball,\" because night baseball had been taking place off and on since the sport's creation. The earliest known game of artificially illuminated baseball took place on September 2, 1880, at Nantasket Beach, Massachusetts. Exhibition games would regularly be played with artificial lighting, however, professional sports resisted the innovation–particularly all major and minor leagues covered by the National Agreement governed by Major League Baseball. \n\r\nThere were fears that night ball would lead to injury.

          "description": "In the early 20th century, the Soudan Iron Mine awarded employees of the mine lots on neighboring Stuntz Bay on Lake Vermilion to build boathouses. The employees were tasked with supplying their own materials and labor for the construction of their boathouses. Most were built with tamarack logs and reclaimed corrugated metal from the mine.\n\r\nOver 140 of these boathouses still stand today, albeit in various states of disrepair, with some renovated for continued use, and some crumbling into the bay. The boathouses now reside within the boundaries of Soudan Underground Mine State Park and have been listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\r\nThe owners of any boathouses not already surrendered to the park will be the last generation to own them, as current rules prohibit the transfer of ownership under any circumstances. Once the owner dies or surrenders ownership, the boathouse becomes the property of the park. This leaves the fate of the boathouses uncertain, as it's likely the park will not repair or restore them once they've taken ownership.",

          "description": "The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune has one of the largest collections of rare books and manuscripts in South Asia. Within the grounds of the institute, next to the main building, stands an impressive guest house. It was built in 1933 with funds granted by Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\r\nThe guest house was built to accommodate the researchers and scholars who used to visit the institute for study and research. According to historians, along with the funds of Rs. 50,000/- for the construction of the guest house, the Nizam had also granted Rs. 1,000/- per year for 11 years for the publication of the Mahabharata by the institute.\n\r\n On April 15, 1948, Dr. M. R. Jayakar was appointed as the first Vice Chancellor of the University of Poona (later the University of Pune and now Savitribai Phule Pune University). He was in search of a place to establish the office of the varsity and start working, since the current university building was then the seasonal retreat and monsoon residence of the Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) and was called the Governor House.\n\r\nDr. R. N. Dandekar, the then secretary of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute suggested Dr. Jayakar to set up the university office at the Nizam’s Guest House. Soon thereafter, the office of the university was started from here and was located here until June 1, 1949.\n\r\nIn 1949, the University was allocated land of over 411 acres, which is its current campus. The erstwhile Governor's House has become the main office building of the university since then. \n\r\nThe Nizam’s Guest House is a beautiful stately building with elegantly designed balconies, windows, corridors, and archways. It has been declared a Grade 1 Heritage Structure and is evocative of a bygone era, reminding passersby of the city’s fascinating history.",

This collection is not for sale in the store (it is actually a clothing and secondhand store), so their employees ended up adding signs to avoid the many daily inquiries about purchasing.\n\r\nThe collection has been composed by the owners and employees throughout their lives.

          "description": "In the 1950s, the town of Silverton, Colorado was in a troubled situation. The largest mine in the county had closed and the railroad that brought tourists from Durango was struggling. The idea for a large Christ statue in Silverton was first conceived at a Catholic men’s club in 1958. It was the hope that such a statue might revitalize the spirit of the town, and perhaps even the economy. \n\r\nThe slopes of Anvil Mountain were chosen as the site for the shrine since it overlooked the entire city. The statue itself was fashioned from 12 tons of Italian Carrara marble, the same source as Michelangelo’s \"David\". The alcove around the statue was made from stone local to the area. The catholic church provided financial support. The townspeople of Silverton also donated their money, supplies, and labor to the project. In 1959, the statue was complete, standing an impressive 16 feet on its pedestal.\n\r\nShortly after the construction of the shrine, the Sunnyside Mine was reopened providing new employment to the citizens of Silverton. It is unknown if the new shrine played any part in the decision to reopen the mines. However, when the mines flooded in 1978, many credited the shrine for protecting the miners. While all the mines in Silverton are now closed for good, the Christ of the Mines still endures as a monument to Silverton’s history and the resilience of its people.",

As a very small country in the center of Western Europe, Luxembourg has braved a tumultuous history of fighting and bartering for its independence from multiple invading and occupying forces. This motto speaks to the ambition of the Luxembourgish people to retain their independence, identity, and sovereignty.\n\r\nThe motto is pulled from Luxembourgish patriotic song, written in 1859 by De Feierwon. In Luxembourgish, the lyrics of the chorus read: \"Kommt hier aus Frankräich, Belgie, Preisen, / Mir wellen iech ons Hémecht weisen, / Frot dir no alle Säiten hin, / Mir welle bleiwe wat mir sin.\"\n\r\nIn English, this translates as: \"Come here from France, Belgium, Prussia, / we want to show you our fatherland / ask in all directions, / We want to stay what we are.\"\n\r\nAlthough this motto is posted in many places across Luxembourg, this version, which is painted on an ancient tower above Rue de la Loge is probably the most famous.",

However, it was bought by a businessman named Weill-Einstein at the turn of the 18th century. The only condition was that \"a beautiful building appropriate to the location of the building site be built on the building site within five years of the transfer of ownership.\" \n\r\nThis demand was fulfilled through the construction of a public observatory.\n\r\nThe observatory was completed in 1907 and was the first concrete building in the city, it was also fully separate from the surrounding building to minimize vibrations. Despite this technology, no science was ever done in the tower, instead, it has always been used to teach astronomy and explain how telescopes work. \n\r\nInside the building is a beautiful Zeiss refractor that was custom-built for this tower.

The title is wordy, but enticing: The Forager's Harvest Bible: The Ultimate Guide to Wild Food and Edible Plants Foraging, Identification and Harvesting. In his headshot, the author, Hector Lawson, smiles sternly but gently. His biography tells us that he was “raised amidst nature, on the outskirts of a bustling city,” though it doesn’t say where. Nor does it list Lawson’s other publications or his professional or educational background; there are just a few bland paragraphs about his “desire to reconnect with nature.” Googling “Hector Lawson” with “foraging,” or doing a reverse image search of the headshot, turns up nothing except the book.\n\r\nThis is because Hector Lawson, alleged foraging expert, l…",

Currently it sits on the desk of Floyd Shockley, the museum’s entomology collections manager. He’s spent his spare summer hours in 2023 meticulously working on the contents of this box—re-placing rhinestones and replica rubies. The box contains 28 maquech beetles: bedazzled bugs once meant to be worn as living jewelry.\n\r\n“I can’t say for sure, but I’d wager this is one of the best and most well-rounded collections in terms of different decorative styles of maquechs,” he says.\n\r\nMaquech, or makech, beetles are objects of legend, and also tourist trinkets and sources of concern for both border control and conservationists.

Penney,” and you’ll likely be met with a description of big box stores in dying shopping malls of various cities and suburbs. And yet, this retail giant actually got its start in the remote rural town of Kemmerer, Wyoming, where its “Mother Store” still exists today.\n\r\nJames Cash Penney, Jr. was born outside Hamilton, Missouri, in 1875. After moving west in hopes that the weather would be good for his health, he ended up working for Thomas Callahan and Guy Johnson, who owned the Golden Rule dry goods store chain operating throughout Colorado and Wyoming. In 1902, Callahan and Johnson gave Penney seed money to open a store in Ogden, Utah. Believing that market to be too large, Penney suggested Kemmerer as an a…",

          "description": "Otaru was known for its herring fisheries during the last half of the 19th century. Its golden year was 1897, when it scored a record total of a near-million ton of herrings—accounting for six-tenths of that year's national catch.\n\r\nLike a gold rush, the abundance of fish attracted opportunity-seekers and drove them out to sea. Collectively referred to as yan-shū in the north, these fishermen were known for their rough nature and their sea shanty called Sōran Bushi, which continues to be remembered as one of Japan's most iconic folk songs.\n\r\nIn Otaru, the yan-shū lodged in dormitories at massive mansions called Nishin-Goten. Built by the nouveau riche who had made their fortunes from huge catches of herrings, these wooden \"herring palaces\" typically stood on the hilltop by the seaside so that any shoal of herrings was not missed.\n\r\nFew herring palaces have survived over the years, but few of those standing today are herring palaces, technically speaking. A majority of them are either banya, smaller-scale lodges for the herring fishermen, or villas built by the fishery bosses for themselves.\n\r\nStanding on a hilltop along the Ishikari Bay coastline is the Otaru Herring Palace, the \"real\" Nishin-Goten completed in 1897. Initially built in Shakotan, it was moved to its current location in 1958 and is now managed by the Otaru Aquarium as a historic monument and museum.\n\r\nOn display are mainly fishermen’s equipment and old photographs, as well as scenes from Otaru’s fishery past re-enacted by dolls and in dioramas. Still, the main exhibit is the building itself. The lodging area, the spacious hall, and the wooden beams, all hearken back to the heyday of Otaru's herring era. Visitors can also feel the past in fishermen's clothes that can be worn for free.",

In the distance, a caravan of riders is traveling alongside you, driving cattle. These silhouetted figures are known as the \"Ghost Riders of the Chisholm Trail.\"\n\r\nThe Abilene stockyards opened in 1866, providing a new, safer, and shorter route for Texas ranchers to deliver their goods to the north and east. They began to use an old hunting and trading route through indigenous territory, that had been scouted by Jesse Chisholm, a Cherokee merchant, and his friend Black Beaver, a Lenape guide and trader. The trail, which became known as the Chisholm Trail, runs through what is now Highway 81. As the railroad grew, the trail changed shape, eventually ending at Caldwell, before being overtaken by newer, better routes.\n\r\nIn 1995, a group of volunteers worked together to memorialize this era in silhouetted steel. The trail is best viewed at dawn, as the sun breaks over the trail, or at dusk, as the trail figures seemingly come to life as they face the waning light.",

On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\n\nThe Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”",

          "description": "p. 93 2.7.6: You define the support of a section for sheaves of abelian groups, and then define the support of a sheaf for the more general scenario of sheaves of *sets*.  Then you observe that the support of a sheaf can be characterized in terms of the supports of its sections, but this doesn't really make sense for sheaves of sets, because the notion of support of a section doesn't really extend to sheaves of sets.  This characterization works for sheaves of abelian groups, but it's not until the next paragraph that you actually explain how to generalize the definition of support of a sheaf in terms of the initial object of the corresponding category.  So some rearrangement would probably help here.",

(pp. 264-265) you repeatedly write \\pi^{-1} instead of (presumably) \\pi^\\sharp when talking about pulling back functions.\r\n\r\n2) In the discussion immediately after Theorem 18.1.2. (cohomology of line bundles on projective space) you mention that its top cohomology group is generated by the homogeneous degree-m Laurent polynomials in (x_0 ... x_n)^{-1} k[x_0 ... x_n]. After following the calculations in section 18.3. I feel like it should be the module of homogeneous degree-m Laurent polynomials, in which every variable appears in negative degree, i.e. the degree-m part of (x_0 ... x_n)^{-1} k[x_0^{-1} ... x_n^{-1}].",

That is, maybe when we are analyzing ML methods we are looking in the wrong place, and we should be analyizing the data to which they are successfully applied? I made fun of interpretation in ML, and that led to interesting comments from both Bietti and the audience. Several audience members suggested taking something more like a  approach to interpretation: How does the method work under interventions or in conditional situations? That's interesting; it isn't what a physicist would consider interpetation, but it might be sufficient in many cases.datacausal",

As we all know, conservation laws are related to symmetries; each symmetry of the laws of physics creates a conservation law. Or does it? Well, it's a theorem! But it's a theorem when the laws of physics are lagrangian (or hamiltonian). That is, every symmetry of a hamiltonian system is associated with a conservation law in that system. So I asked: How do we know if or whether the world is lagrangian or hamiltonian? How could we know that? My best guess is that we know it because of these very conservation laws!

I spent the whole weekend thinking about it: If a few planets are forming in a proto-planetary disk, there are all sorts of interactions between the planets and the disk, and the planets and each other, and the disk with itself. You can think of this (at least) two different ways:\nYou can think of planets which are interacting not just directly with one another, but also with a disk, and with each other as mediated by that disk. This is the planet-centric view. In this view, the planets are what you are tracking, and the disk is a latent object that makes the planets interact and evolve.\nAlternatively, you can think of the disk, with planets in it. In this disk-centric view, the planets are latent objects that modify the disk, creating gaps and spiral waves.\nBoth views are legitimate, and both have interesting science questions. We will explore and see where to work. I am partial to the planet-centric view: I want to know where planetary systems come from!",

One interaction was in the Astronomical Data Meeting at Flatiron, where Vivi Acquaviva (CUNY) talked about the intersection between what you are good at, what is important, and what brings you joy. That's a hard intersection to find. Or way too easy; I am not sure. The other interaction was a conversation with Jiayin Dong (Flatiron), who is thinking about faculty job applications and the like.

I discussed these issues with Contardo (SISSA) today, in the context of our project to (confidently) find infrared excesses around boring old main-sequence stars. One option is to look at the performance on held-out data. But then you have to decide how to aggregate this information in a way that is relevant for each object in your sample: They probably don't all have the same uncertainty! Another option is to look at the variation of prediction across training sets. That's good! But it requires that you have lots of training data. In this case, we do, so that's where we are at right now.",
