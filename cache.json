Located in Louisville's Seelbach Hotel, it's the only surviving room in the world completely encrusted in Rookwood pottery, from stem to stern, and has a powerfully creepy vibe.\n\r\nThe Bavarian-style Rathskeller Room was constructed of Rookwood Pottery in 1907. A unique work of art and the only room of its kind in the world that’s still intact, this room is an ornate, preserved part of American history. The decorations of the room were drawn by hand on the clay before firing; the design was a part of the ware. After baking, various glazes were added in subsequent firings. A portion of the ceiling is made of leather and was painted with intricate designs (including the 12 signs of the zodiac).\n\r\nAl Capone is said to have used secret tunnels in and out of the place as part of his organized crime operation. When F. Scott Fitzgerald was a young soldier stationed at Camp Zachary Taylor, he came into Louisville and was a frequent visitor at the Seelbach Hotel's subterranean bar. The time Fitzgerald spent there allegedly inspired parts of The Great Gatsby.\n\r\nThe hotel is also chock-full of ghost stories. Its most infamous ghost is known as the \"Lady in Blue,\" said to be the spirit of a young woman who died in one of the hotel's elevator shafts.",

A section of this history is showcased in Geneva's Musée d'Histoire des Sciences (Museum of History of Science), where the developments made between the 17th and 19th centuries are showcased alongside additional more modern tools. \n\r\nIn the past, science was largely an occupation for the elite, meaning that those who practiced it were either rich enough to afford it or had patrons who could pay them to pursue it. This means that everything up to their equipment was often very well made, also in a way that made the instruments pleasing to the eye besides just functional. This makes them the ideal tool to explain science with, as important parts were often laid bare for show rather than covered to be protected.\n\r\nMany of those instruments are on display in the museum, tools that were used in the fields of astronomy, microscopy, gnomonics, electricity, meteorology, and measuring in general.",

You can still see this term in action today in dishes like pizza rustica, a rich egg-and-cheese-stuffed pie from central Italy, or pizza Ebraica, a blackened cookie made with nuts and dried fruit that originated in the Jewish quarter of Rome.\n\r\nBefore the 20th century, the cheese pizza that we know and love was a local street food little-known outside of Naples.

The team uses strong lines and circle hooks—harmless to the sharks—baited with striped bonito fish, thick rubber mats to protect the inflatable boat from sharp teeth, and something called tonic immobility: essentially, a shark’s Achilles’ heel.\n\r\n“Once you can get a shark upside down, they pretty much just fall asleep,” says Daly. “It's pretty incredible.”\n\r\nIt's still unclear why sharks are prone to this state, but it may have evolved around mating behavior, with the male shark grabbing the female shark by its pectoral fi…",

          "description": "In the town of Prrenjas, situated in eastern Albania, a once-dilapidated industrial relic has been transformed into a captivating landmark. Artist Eljan Tanini took a pair of abandoned nickel mining towers—vestiges of Albania's failed industrial aspirations under communist rule—and transformed them with an astonishing 1,380 ladybugs. Symbolizing femininity and good fortune, these ladybugs are a vibrant nod to the town's female mayor and its broader identity.\n\r\nDuring the rule of communist leader Enver Hoxha, Albania underwent a period of intense industrialization while being cut off from the rest of the world. This left a legacy of aging factories, bunkers, and mining facilities scattered across the country. Since the fall of communism, these structures have largely been abandoned, standing as solemn monuments to a repressive past. However, art projects like the one in Përrenjas demonstrate the potential for turning these sites into symbols of renewal and hope.\n\r\nThe project was completed in just 22 days and features eco-friendly paint.

          "description": "The volunteer-driven cultural association Bolsjefabrikken (The Candy Factory) has taken its name from an abandoned candy factory, the group’s very first location, and is behind Copenhagen’s (and possibly Denmark’s) largest street art hotspot. Artists and activists have been infusing new vitality into the current Bolsjefabrikken place since 2009. Once a smithy, the locale’s exterior walls now serve as ever-transforming canvases for street artists, resulting in a captivating display of colors, shapes, and messages.\n\r\nBolsjefabrikken has gained official recognition as a designated area for artistic expression, thanks to the endorsement of local authorities. This acknowledgment not only validates the art created on these walls but also nurtures a profound sense of belonging among the individuals who have rejuvenated its premises. Alongside its varied non-profit offerings, the venue hosts music performances, film screenings, and communal gatherings.\n\r\nWhether you’re a culture enthusiast or someone seeking an immersive urban adventure, Bolsjefabrikken offers an ever-shifting and thought-provoking experience. In this mural mecca, contemporary graffiti shines as brilliantly and boldly as the vibrant candies that were once manufactured in the factory that named the collective years ago.",

          "description": "The Halte Royal d'Ardennes (the Royal Train Stop of the Ardennes) was a private train stop built for King Leopold II of Belgium and linked to the royal family's summer residence, Château royal d'Ardenne. Court architect Alphonse Balat designed the opulent residence, which was completed in 1891. Guests and royalty would use the private train stop to visit the château, which also featured extensive gardens designed by the Paris-based landscape architect Elie Lainé.\n\r\nWithin a few years, Leopold II decided to repurpose the residence into a luxury hotel. Wealthy guests from Belgian, French, and English began to visit the hotel via the train. The hotel featured every luxury amenity of the time: running water, bathrooms, electrical lights, and even a telephone. \n\r\nBoth the train station and the hotel were shuttered during World War I after sustaining some damage. \n\r\nThe hotel and train stop briefly reopened after being restored and expanded after the war. But then, during World War II, both suffered further damage. Finally, in 1968, the hotel burned down and the train stop was abandoned. (It's not the only abandoned royal Belgian train station, either.)\n\r\nDespite this, the train stop is still an impressive ruin with its watch tower and stone walls. Surrounded by the River Lesse on one side and the woods and hills of the Belgian Ardennes on the other, the dilapidated station looks more like something out of a fairytale.\n\r\nA special architectural feature is the cobblestone driveway, spiraling out from the platform and around a central courtyard. You don't need much imagination to see the coaches lined up, waiting to pick up the VIPs of their time.",

          "description": "Soutra Aisle was a medieval hospital, a place of refuge for wayfarers and pilgrims, one that welcomed the needy or elderly as well as the sick and infirm. It also acted as a place of sanctuary for fugitives. It stands midway between Edinburgh and the rich Borders abbeys on the Via Regia or Royal Highway, the main Anglo-Scottish road for the medieval period. This spot was originally the place where five roads met, which ensured a regular flow of people in need.\n\r\nSoutra Aisle was first mentioned in 1164 after King Malcolm IV confirmed the foundation of the charter. The hospital was run by the Augustinian Order, funded by the income from the large hospital estate. Despite being located in a war zone up until 1320, Soutra Aisle continued to grow. It eventually covered an area of 700 square meters, and became one of the three most important hospitals in Scotland at the time.\n\r\nSoutra Aisle was of both national and international importance up until the 1460s, when it experienced a rapid decline. Soutra Aisle lost its lands, which caused an almost instant loss of funds that was devastating to the hospital. The estate was confiscated and handed to the Trinity College Hospital in Edinburgh because the Master of the Hospital, Stephen Fleming was accused of misconduct.\n\r\nIt only survived because it became the burial vault of the Pringle family. This new purpose saved the church from the same fate as the rest of the site, which saw its stone carted away and repurposed in nearby building projects.\n\r\nArchaeological excavations have turned up rare seeds, sourced from all over the world, that were used for their medicinal properties, including opium poppies, cloves, and hemlock.",

Within the act, there were around 300 pages of technical requirements included to satisfy landowners along the 36-mile route.\n\r\nOne of those requirements was for a \"ferry by night and by day whenever required\" to be maintained by the canal's owners to replace Hulmes Bridge, a low-lying bridge that connected the villages of Flixton and Irlam.\n\r\nOriginally serviced by rear-oared scull boats, the free Hulmes Ferry is still in operation today with the Peel Group now responsible for its maintenance. The boat is harbored on the Flixton side of the river, so those crossing from the Irlam side need to ring a bell to get the ferryman's attention.\n\r\nThe crossing takes just under a minute to complete, with a limit of four passengers onboard.\n\r\nSimilar rights of way across the canal can be found upriver, with the Thelwall Ferry providing a similar service for the small cost of 11p, and the Warburton Toll Bridge costing 12p to travel over. The original 1885 act didn't allow for inflation to be calculated into the ferry cost, hence some highly affordable ferries outside of Manchester.",

One of the best-known examples is found in Los Angeles, while Mexico City has a pair of its own.\n\r\nThe first of these was gifted in 2010 and can be found in the Parque Bicentenario (Bicentennial Park), on the city's northwest. The other, donated two years later, is located more centrally, right in front of the well-known Mothers' Monument. Both are smaller than the original, although still impressive in their dimensions. Weighing nearly one ton, the bronze bells are four feet (1.4 meters) tall and with a diameter of 80 centimeters.\n\r\nDespite the two-year difference between their giftings, these two bells were given by the South Korean government in order to celebrate the centennial of the start of the Mexican Revolution, and the bicentennial of the start of the War of Independence, both commemorated in 2010.\n\r\nThe 2012 date is also appropriate as it represented 50 years since diplomatic relations between South Korea and Mexico were established. Their respective plaques have text in both Spanish and Korean.",

          "description": "Nothing washes ashore here but seaweed and bones. The island is Inishtrahull, or Inis Trá Tholl in Irish, which roughly translates as \"island of the hollow beach,\" Ireland's most northerly island. Though uninhabited now, it once had a small resident community for many years. As rural a life you could live was the islanders who once called Inishtrahull home.\n\r\nA low plateau sits in the middle of the island, bookended by two rocky pinnacles. The southern of those high points is home to the Inishtrahull Lighthouse, first built in 1813. For a time, lighthouse keepers, fishermen, and their families made up a small community that mostly occupied the plateau in the central part of the island. At its peak in 1911, there were 80 residents living on the remote island.\n\r\nOver time, fishing by large trawlers depleted the stock in the waters around Inishtrahull. People started leaving the island, and the remaining residents evacuated in 1929. In the following decades, only a lighthouse keeper called the small island home. A new lighthouse was built in the 1950s, and when it was automated a few decades later the island was left without any residents at all.\n\r\nThere are no trees or hedges. But its abundance of nature flowers and fauna make it the perfect location for seabirds, and the tidal sound makes it an attractive stopping point for grey seals. The island has been designated as an area of special conservation interest.\n\r\nToday, the center of the island is scattered with ruins of old stone cottages and the school masters house and school. There is also a small graveyard. And the shell of the old lighthouse 1812 watches over its sister lighthouse, which claims the title of Ireland's most northernmost lighthouse. For many emigrating from Ireland, it was the last bit of home they saw on their journey to the United States. “Inishtrahull lighthouse off the coast of Donegal was the last glimpse emigrants would have of Ireland,\" according to the account of one of those emigrants. \"Everyone stayed on deck until it disappeared.”",

          "description": "\"La Via delle Pietre\" (\"The Path of Stones\") is located along a country road at the base of Monte Cereto, in the village of Albino. It is around 114 feet (35 meters) long and consists of more than 1,000 carved stones. This is the creation of a local artist named Remo Ponti, who can often be found on-site creating new artwork.\n\r\nPonti was a metalworker by training and profession, but his true calling was art. In 2014, he decided to turn a rural stone wall into a work of art, and it took him six years to complete.\n\r\nThe themes of these carved stones are as varied as they can be—animals, faces, everyday objects, geometric patterns, and abstract compositions. As Ponti unravels the symbolism behind each stone, it becomes clear that these stones are the repository of his life experience, emotions, and philosophy. \n\r\nA wide face on a stone may represent the executioner who lost his job following the invention of the guillotine, but he rejoices at the occasional chance of wielding his axe again. On another stone is the wing of a butterfly, with a minuscule stylized human figure on the side, representing the artist facing the beauty and complexity of the natural world, and ultimately, the universe. Contemplating the variety of themes on the wall is as gratifying as learning about their hidden meaning. Ponti manufactured all the different chisels and hammers that he used to create his art.",

However, there is one home that seems to stick out considerably from the rest. Although it may appear out of place, this house has long been here before the others and has the distinction of being the oldest continuously occupied home in the United States.\n\r\nThe house was owned by Deane Winthrop, the sixth son of John Winthrop who the town is named after. The house was originally built in 1637 by Captain William Pierce and acquired by Deane in 1647. It was remodeled and rebuilt several times with the current structure dating to around 1675 with an addition later added in 1696.\n\r\nToday, the home is owned by the Winthrop Improvement and Historical Association and houses a wide array of historical artifacts such as a 1641 Bible written in classical Greek, dishes from China ordered in 1775, a Springfield musket made in 1823, and an assortment of furniture hundreds of years old. But it still serves as a private residence the same as it did almost 350 years ago from Puritans, Minuteman, and homeowners today.\n\r\nIf you have an interest in early American history and would like to see the oldest still lived-in home in the country, the Deane Winthrop House is certainly worth a visit.",

Across India, these trees can be commonly seen planted next to temples.\n\r\nNanasaheb Peshwa built this temple complex in 1749.

          "description": "War can leave behind strange legacies. One such odd creation is the existence of Via Ferrata, or \"iron path,\" a system of steel rungs and cables built into the side of mountains.\n\r\nDuring World War I in the Dolomites mountains of Italy, the mountainous peaks became the heated site of battle between the Austro-Hungarians and Italians. Fixed lines of steel cable were installed to help transport goods so climbers could clip into the lines and be less afraid of falling to their deaths. It was a brutal, icy, battle on those mountains, with soldiers freezing, starving, and falling to their deaths when they weren't being shot at or blown up. However, after the fighting was done, the Via Ferrata remained, ready for adventurous climbers to clip in.\n\r\nDecades later, during World War II, and halfway around the world in West Virginia, the 10th Mountain Division was training to fight on very similar terrain in the Apennines of Italy. To do so, they used the closest analog they could find: Nelson Rocks.\n\r\nThe Nelson Rocks, situated in the Monongahela National Forest, are famous for their two fins, thin ridges of rock bursting up 800 feet above the streams running through the forest below. Built in 2002, by private owner Stu Hammett, the Via Ferrata is one of only three found on the east coast of the United States.\n\r\nClimbers go up over 1000 feet of elevation and cross a 200-foot-long suspension bridge on the trip. One of the real draws of Via Ferrata is that it allows non-climbers to take routes, and access heights that would otherwise be too dangerous or technical for them.",

In Newton, Kansas, a group of talented artists have created a majestic sculpture to harness and evoke this feeling of the expansive sky.\n\r\nCompleted in 2001, the Blue Sky Sculpture was created “to blend with the natural sky,” as a plaque at the viewing stand suggests, which “requires a patient and contemplative viewer.”\n\r\nPainter Phil Epp worked with ceramicists Terry Corbett and Conrad Snider to create an arced and undulating structure, where the cobalt blue glaze of the ceramic tiles and fluffy white painted clouds reflect the color of the sky throughout the day. Viewers are encouraged to stand in between the sculptures, in what is known as the “sky passageway.” To complete the motif, two giant abstract stoneware figures stand next to the sculpture, further encouraging interactivity.\n\r\nThe sculpture was donated by local philanthropist and inventor Lloyd E. Smith in memory of his wife, Jacqueline, and has since become a symbol of the community, inspiring further designs and being named one of the Eight Wonders of Kansas Art.",

Since 1948, Oklahoma City has displayed its beacon of dairy goodness to thirsty travelers making their way across the Mother Road. \n\r\nThe wedge-shaped red brick building was already an unusual sight on Classen Boulevard when it was built in 1930, as it was one of Oklahoma City’s few triangular lots. At the time, Classon Boulevard was part of Route 66 itself, and the grocery building would be a stop on the streetcar line that ran along the street. In 1948, the milk bottle was added, as a prime example of roadside mimetic architecture, where it has stood ever since. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.\n\r\nCuriously, the building and the milk bottle have always been separate establishments. The building itself, with its unusual size and foot traffic, has hosted several businesses, including a banh mi shop, a barbecue shack, a design studio, and a private nail salon. Likewise, the milk bottle has had a number of different dairy companies adorn it as an advertisement. Currently, the milk bottle bears the logo of Braum’s, the beloved Okie dairy farm, grocery, and fast food chain that has stores across the state.",

He chose Osby, the hometown of his mother-in-law, as the location for crafting his artwork, Apan och Kaninen (\"The Bunny and Monkey\"), and enlisted the help of local artist Sven-Ingvar Johansson, who is an expert in carving animal figures with chainsaws.\n\r\nTowering at 15 feet (4.5 meters) and constructed from cellular plastic and fiberglass cloth, the animal figures were modeled after two of Apelgren’s childhood toys. The artist wanted to make something \"kind and childlike\" as a nod to renowned toy manufacturer BRIO, which was based in Osby for over 100 years and runs a popular toy museum in town. \n\r\nWhile some locals found the colossal animal duo comical and jokingly called it Sweden's modern answer to the Easter Island statues, others thought the large sculptures ruined the scenic lakefront and that they should be moved to a playground instead. \n\r\nAfter being vandalized a few times, the artwork was eventually set on fire one summer night in 2013. As a result, the monkey figure was reduced to ashes and the rabbit figure was scorched. However, thanks to local businesses and the Municipality of Osby, the animal pair was restored and re-inaugurated two years later.",

Live complex, just steps from the arena where the Grammy Awards are most often held. The second, naturally, is located in the small town of Cleveland, Mississippi, two hours away from the nearest big city.\n\r\nSo… what are artifacts from the most famous pop music stars and a massive museum with interactive exhibits doing in a place like Cleveland? There are a few answers. The answer the Grammy Museum Mississippi offers is that Cleveland is located in the Mississippi Delta, as one of a string of music museums dotting the landscape of the cradle of American music along the Mississippi Blues Trail between Memphis and Jackson. Additionally, the proximity to Delta State University gives it an educational function. A more cynical answer may have to do with the flow of economic development funding to Mississippi in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and how much of it was used on major white elephant projects instead of direct aid to its residents.\n\r\nEither way, the GRAMMY Museum Mississippi is a striking 28,000-square-foot building that combines L.A. glitz with Delta architectural vernacular. Exhibits include outfits worn by popstars including Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Charli XCX, and more, alongside exhibits of blues greats such as Bobby Rush and local legend B.B. King. \n\r\nA special spotlight is placed on Mississippi music legends from Jimmie Rodgers through today, including Elvis Presley, who was born in Tupelo. Finally, the museum includes films, theatrical presentations, and a soundstage and studio, with interactive exhibits on the blues to help you hone your skills on your way to a Grammy nomination of your own.",

(Godric was never formally canonized, so the term \"saint\" is a bit of a misnomer.)\n\r\nFollowing a long illness, perhaps brought on by the hardship of his self-imposed ascetic lifestyle which included sleeping outdoors in all weather, Godric died in 1170. After his death, two monks were sent to occupy the hermitage. \n\r\nThe main buildings of the priory date to 1237, and the church was completed in 1277.

Ever since a colossal bone from the find has been on display within the historic church.  \n\r\nThis church is one of two churches in Warsaw dedicated to St. Anne. The church with the mammoth bone, St. Anne's Church or Kościół św. Anny, is in the city center: The second church, the Belfry at St. Anne, is in in the historic Wilanów district where King John III Sobieski of Poland's Wilanów Palace is located. The two churches mark the beginning and end of the Royal Route, which connects the Royal Castle with Wilanów Palace.\n\r\nInitially, the 14th-century Church of St. Leonard stood on this site. Later, in 1772, Prince August Adam Czartoryski commissioned architect Jan Kotelnicki to rebuild the church using bricks in a Neoclassical style. It was during this second phase of construction that the mammoth skeleton was discovered. The newly renovated church was renamed St. Anne's Church.\n\r\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the church was renovated in a Neo-Rennaisance style by Enrico Marconi, Leonardo Marconi, and Jan Huss. Sculptor Bolesław Syrewicz also made sculptures to dot the church's façades and the wall decorations were added by Antoni Kolberg.\n\r\nThe church survived both World Wars with minimal damage, and today is one of Warsaw's oldest buildings.",

          "description": "The 1968 Tlatelolco Massacre is almost certainly the best-known case of the country's government reacting with deadly force to student protests, but it was not the last one. Just three years later on June 10, the Feast of Corpus Christi, a paramilitary group known as Los Halcones (The Hawks) repressed another student protest in Mexico City, with around 120 victims. Due to the date and perpetrators, this would come to be known as both the Halconazo and Corpus Christi Massacre.\n\r\nAs had been the case in the entire country's modern democracy, and up to 2000, the ruling party was the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). At the time, the authorities maintained that the Halcones were an independent organization. In the following years however, direct connections were established between the group and the PRI, several institutions of the Mexico City government, and even the CIA, as there have been suspicions that they assisted in their training. This goes to show that, even as a paramilitary organization, the Halcones enacted the massacre under the auspices of the city and national authorities.\n\r\nForty years later, this sculpture was installed outside the city's Escuela Normal (Teaching School) as this was the alma mater of many of the victims of the massacre. Its sculptor, Enrique Carbajal (known as Sebastián), was actually arrested and held in a military prison in 1968, so his role as the artist behind this piece is symbolic. Additionally, he has often been commissioned for public artworks, usually in a signature monochrome, abstract style.\n\r\nThe 2011 sculpture, which might be officially titled Sangre Derramada (\"Spilled Blood\"), although this is unclear, represents several elements related to the massacre. At the bottom, a Christian cross ties the monument to the Corpus Christi date. Atop, glyphs similar to those used by the country's pre-Columbian cultures are piled up to form a 15-meter-tall structure. The monument is completed by a plaque listing the names of 40 of the victims of that day.",

Next to it, a comparatively tiny human struggles to keep up, swimming by the creature's side. While the tag-along may seem like an eager tourist, it’s actually a scientist imitating one.\n\r\nHis fellow researchers look on via boat and drone, taking aerial footage of how the largest fish in the sea—the whale shark—responds to “tourists” frantically trying to keep up with them in the hope of a once-in-a-lifetime wildlife experience. But for the sharks, this attention is a double-edged sword. People can be annoying, but their love—and tourist dollars—can help protect the massive, docile sharks.\n\r\n“It's definitely an example of where you could love an animal to death kind of thing,” says senior d…",

Vatnajökull Park covers approximately 14 percent of Iceland and consists of a stunning mixture of majestic mountains, active volcanoes, massive glaciers, and mesmerizing lagoons. \n\r\nHeinabergslón Lagoon is fed from the Heinabergsjokull glacier, which is part of the larger Vatnajökull ice cap. When the water melts, it pools in lagoons, such as Heinabergslón. Because of the tumultuous geology of this region, the melting water often carries volcanic dust, making the water in these basins quite murky. However, Heinabergslón is more than 330 feet deep, enabling the detritus to sit at the bottom of the lagoon, leaving the water at the surface crystal clear.\n\r\nHeinabergslón is a mere 23 miles from the much more famous Jökulsárlón…",

It holds great cultural and historical significance as one of the city's most iconic landmarks, holding nostalgic value for many people who remember its role as a luxurious meeting place in Yugoslavia. What's more, it was visited by a plethora of highly renowned international celebrities, politicians, athletes, and artists since its construction, including Queen Elizabeth II, Richard Nixon, Neil Armstrong, and Belgian and Dutch royals.\n\r\nAfter it was built in 1969, the hotel quickly became a symbol of the modernization and progress of Yugoslavia. It was designed by a team of prominent Yugoslav architects led by Lavoslav Horvat, and features a distinctive Brutalist architectural style on the banks of the Danube. Over the years, the hotel has undergone renovations to update its facilities and amenities while preserving its architectural character.\n\r\nIn its heyday, it was a five-star hotel, laced with chandeliers and lavish silver and gold elements, but today it is a more affordable three-star hotel that offers a range of comfortable accommodations. It is without a doubt that the hotel has faced challenges and changes over the years such as being severely damaged in the NATO bombing of the 90s. It will, however, eternally remain a recognizable symbol of Belgrade's history and architectural heritage. \n\r\nToday, Hotel Jugoslavija continues to welcome guests from around the world, offering a blend of modern comforts, historic charm, and beautiful riverfront views. It serves as a reminder of the city's past, with many solemn documentaries such as Hotel Yugoslavia (2017) having been filmed about the once full-of-life hotel in the quaint neighborhood of Zemun.",

The land was used by the Mescalero Apache nation and may have been a sanctuary for Geronimo, the legendary Apache leader. Later, it was purportedly used by Billy the Kid as a hideout. These facts are likely \"history-ish,\" but Billy the Kid did live along the trail that now bears his name, and famously escaped from the nearby Lincoln County Courthouse.\n\r\nIn the early 1950s, the store’s unique structure was built, and in 1954, it was sold to George Fuchs, along with his wife Mildred. Fuchs renamed Ice Cave the Fox Cave, pronounced like his last name. The store was a popular roadside stop along Highway 70 through the 1950s, but its legacy faded over time.\n\r\nThe site had been long abandoned when Arnold Duke, a gemologist and proprietor of the nearby Ruidoso River Museum, purchased it in 2010. Putting some care into its rehabilitation, the site has reopened as a mid-century style tourist trap, although one with an unusually strong gem collection. The place is replete with aliens, dinosaurs, relics of the Old West, and all sorts of curios to browse or purchase, all while standing within the cave’s walls.",

Its façade of glazed high-gloss ceramics stands in striking contrast to the gray brutalist concrete of the 1967 courthouse it sits on top of.\n\r\nThe new building appears perched on the courthouse’s roof, yet no physical contact exists between the two structures due to a discreetly positioned 26-foot by 26-foot base in the old building’s courtyard, creating a clever architectural composition reminiscent of a substantial mushroom with its stem securely anchored within the enclosed plaza.\n\r\nDesigned by acclaimed architect Gert Wingårdh, Ting1 boasts 11 floors and a façade featuring 78 glass balconies offering stunning views of the High Coast region’s landscape, including the iconic ski jumping hills. This design contributes to the building’s artistic vibrancy, drawing inspiration from a pixelated version of the late regional artist Bengt Lindström’s oil painting Women's Dance.\n\r\nTing1, called \"the LEGO house\" or \"the Coronavirus\" by some locals, stirs both acclaim and controversy. It was a finalist for the Swedish Building of the Year 2014 award and won the Great Tile Award that year. However, differing opinions emerged, labeling it as \"Ångermanland Province's ugliest building\" in a local 2016 poll, and it was critically spotlighted by the Arkitektupproret (Architectural Uprising) movement, which fights against modernism. This mix of accolades and critiques vividly shapes Ting1's unique standing in architectural discussions.",

YOU CAN SIGN UP HERE.\n\r\nRecently, my friend Rachel found a pile of 1980s cookbooks on a curb and gave them to me as a housewarming present. The one that caught my eye was The JCPenney Microwave Cookbook, with its colorful cover showing a rack of lamb, roast beef, and a ham, all presumably cooked in a microwave. \n  The whole book is a peek into the past, to a time when microwaves were the hot, new appliance. “Welcome to the most versatile system of food preparation ever devised by man,” boasts the inner cover. The cookbook sets out to prove that statement with recipes for dishes that people today would never, ever, cook in a microwave.\n\r\n\r\nLike many 20th-century cookbooks, there is a s…",

          "description": "Many cities have founding myths that explain some aspect of their history and sometimes their name. Kielce, a city in southern Poland, is no different, though their story certainly is quite unique. A statue on the town square depicts a large imposing boar, which is situated on top of a pedestal and surrounded by six brass plates that tell its story.  \n\r\nThe story centers around Prince  Mieszko Bolesławowic, son of the 11th-century Polish King Bolesław II. The prince was sent out into the woods with a large army escort on a hunting trip after the king got into an argument with the Bishop of Krakow and feared for his son's life in retaliation.  \n\r\nIn the woods, the prince and his men found and slayed many beasts, while living an otherwise unremarkable life. That is until one day, when Prince Mieszko saw a giant boar and decided to follow it on his own. This nearly ended in tragedy as he drove into a branch and was knocked out cold.\n\r\nWhile he was unconscious, the prince dreamt that someone had given him poison and that he was dying. However, just before the end Saint Wojciech appeared and healed the prince with cleansing water that appeared from a spot below his cane. The prince woke up to discover that he had been found and helped by his men. To his surprise, he also saw the river from his dreams, and also a pair of large boar tusks (Kły) on the place where he was knocked out. \n\r\nHe decided to build a city here on this holy spot, and called it after the boar's tusks: Kielce.",

Unfortunately, the first version of Otto was…an otter disaster. Steve Jaenisch, a metal artist who went on to create a number of sculptures around town, finished the job and made sure Otto would last for generations to come.\n\r\nToday, the 40-foot-long otter sculpture stands proudly in Adams Park, overlooking the lake.

It also inspired a piece of Stephen King's 1986 novel It: the standpipe in Derry, where Stan first encounters Pennywise.\n\r\nBangor’s most famous resident Stephen King once lived a few blocks away from the standpipe. According to him, he also wrote a significant portion of his book It in the shadow of the standpipe. In the early 1980s, he would walk down the street, sit on a park bench in the small park beneath the standpipe, and write the book. It is said that the tragic stairwell death of the boy in 1940 influenced the creation of the book’s character Pennywise the Clown.\n\r\nThere are no recorded drowning accidents in the standpipe, but for anyone who has read the book or seen either the film or the miniseries, this is an incredibly eerie place to be—even though you’re just staring at an old water tower. Which tells you everything you need to know about the power of King’s writing.\n\r\nIn the 2017 remake of the movie It, one of the characters bikes by a standpipe in the fictional town of Derry, which is King’s thinly disguised version of Bangor. The standpipe was CGI-generated and the movie was filmed in Toronto. There are also references to the standpipe in his other books Dreamcatcher and 11/22/63.",

There is no sign or even a path to get to the sculpture, but you can see it on the east side of the street. You’ll need to walk up a small hill and then through grasslands to get to the sculpture.\n\r\nThere is very little else around in Last Chance, Colorado, so there’s a part of this whole adventure that feels like one has come upon this hidden art creation that no one else knows about.",

          "description": "The San Jacinto Mountains, an upthrust fault block resulting from the San Andreas fault system, rise abruptly east of the Los Angeles basin. With a high point at San Jacinto Peak (10,804 feet/3,294 meters), the range is tall enough to intercept the moisture coming from the Pacific, such that the higher elevations support forests and even a winter snow cap. However, this also causes a rain-shadow desert on the eastern side of the range. The mountain precipitation feeds a number of perennial streams that drain to the east, of which one of the largest is Tahquitz (pronounced TAH-keets) Creek.\n\r\nThe creek drops steeply down the eastern front of the range through a spectacular canyon, from which it formerly flowed out into the desert where the city of Palm Springs now sits. As with any desert creek, its water was of paramount importance for wildlife and the local human population.\n\r\nNear the base of the range, where its grade flattens out, the creek flows over a picturesque waterfall some 60 feet high that can be reached by a footpath. The path runs about 1.8 miles through a scenic desert canyon with an altitude gain of 350 feet. The level is moderate and should be within the capabilities of most hikers. Some rock art is also visible. The creek and falls both lie within the Agua Caliente Cahuilla Reservation and the tribe sells hiking permits.\n\r\nTahquitz, in the local Native American lore, was a malevolent spirit that dwelled in the mountains.",

He ventured into the Alaskan bush in 1992 with minimal supplies, hoping to live off the land. Eventually, McCandless came across an abandoned bus near the Sushana River that he used as a makeshift shelter. It would also become his final resting place. \n\r\nIn 1996, Jon Krakauer published Into The Wild, a book following McCandless's journey that became an international bestseller. In 2007, the book was adapted into a movie directed by Sean Penn and starring Emile Hirsch as McCandless. A replica of the so-called \"Magic Bus\" was created for the movie, and after filming was done it found a permanent home at 49th State Brewing.\n\r\nAs for the real bus. it remained at its remote site for many years, and visiting it became a pilgrimage for people who had been inspired by McCandless's story. But after at least 15 people had to be rescued and two people died attempting to cross the Teklanika River, the bus was airlifted out in June 2020. It was moved to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, where there are plans to put it on display at the Museum of the North.",

The employees were tasked with supplying their own materials and labor for the construction of their boathouses. Most were built with tamarack logs and reclaimed corrugated metal from the mine.\n\r\nOver 140 of these boathouses still stand today, albeit in various states of disrepair, with some renovated for continued use, and some crumbling into the bay. The boathouses now reside within the boundaries of Soudan Underground Mine State Park and have been listed as a Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\r\nThe owners of any boathouses not already surrendered to the park will be the last generation to own them, as current rules prohibit the transfer of ownership under any circumstances. Once the owner dies or surrenders ownership, the boathouse becomes the property of the park. This leaves the fate of the boathouses uncertain, as it's likely the park will not repair or restore them once they've taken ownership.",

Within the grounds of the institute, next to the main building, stands an impressive guest house. It was built in 1933 with funds granted by Mir Osman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\r\nThe guest house was built to accommodate the researchers and scholars who used to visit the institute for study and research. According to historians, along with the funds of Rs. 50,000/- for the construction of the guest house, the Nizam had also granted Rs. 1,000/- per year for 11 years for the publication of the Mahabharata by the institute.\n\r\n On April 15, 1948, Dr. M. R. Jayakar was appointed as the first Vice Chancellor of the University of Poona (later the University of Pune and now Savitribai Phule Pune University). He was in search of a place to establish the office of the varsity and start working, since the current university building was then the seasonal retreat and monsoon residence of the Governor of Bombay (now Mumbai) and was called the Governor House.\n\r\nDr. R. N. Dandekar, the then secretary of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute suggested Dr. Jayakar to set up the university office at the Nizam’s Guest House. Soon thereafter, the office of the university was started from here and was located here until June 1, 1949.\n\r\nIn 1949, the University was allocated land of over 411 acres, which is its current campus. The erstwhile Governor's House has become the main office building of the university since then. \n\r\nThe Nizam’s Guest House is a beautiful stately building with elegantly designed balconies, windows, corridors, and archways. It has been declared a Grade 1 Heritage Structure and is evocative of a bygone era, reminding passersby of the city’s fascinating history.",

          "description": "In the 1950s, the town of Silverton, Colorado was in a troubled situation. The largest mine in the county had closed and the railroad that brought tourists from Durango was struggling. The idea for a large Christ statue in Silverton was first conceived at a Catholic men’s club in 1958. It was the hope that such a statue might revitalize the spirit of the town, and perhaps even the economy. \n\r\nThe slopes of Anvil Mountain were chosen as the site for the shrine since it overlooked the entire city. The statue itself was fashioned from 12 tons of Italian Carrara marble, the same source as Michelangelo’s \"David\". The alcove around the statue was made from stone local to the area. The catholic church provided financial support. The townspeople of Silverton also donated their money, supplies, and labor to the project. In 1959, the statue was complete, standing an impressive 16 feet on its pedestal.\n\r\nShortly after the construction of the shrine, the Sunnyside Mine was reopened providing new employment to the citizens of Silverton. It is unknown if the new shrine played any part in the decision to reopen the mines. However, when the mines flooded in 1978, many credited the shrine for protecting the miners. While all the mines in Silverton are now closed for good, the Christ of the Mines still endures as a monument to Silverton’s history and the resilience of its people.",

          "description": "\"Mir wëlle bleiwe wat mir sinnm,\" Luxembourgish for \"We want to stay what we are,\" is the national motto of Luxembourg. As a very small country in the center of Western Europe, Luxembourg has braved a tumultuous history of fighting and bartering for its independence from multiple invading and occupying forces. This motto speaks to the ambition of the Luxembourgish people to retain their independence, identity, and sovereignty.\n\r\nThe motto is pulled from Luxembourgish patriotic song, written in 1859 by De Feierwon. In Luxembourgish, the lyrics of the chorus read: \"Kommt hier aus Frankräich, Belgie, Preisen, / Mir wellen iech ons Hémecht weisen, / Frot dir no alle Säiten hin, / Mir welle bleiwe wat mir sin.\"\n\r\nIn English, this translates as: \"Come here from France, Belgium, Prussia, / we want to show you our fatherland / ask in all directions, / We want to stay what we are.\"\n\r\nAlthough this motto is posted in many places across Luxembourg, this version, which is painted on an ancient tower above Rue de la Loge is probably the most famous.",

However, it was bought by a businessman named Weill-Einstein at the turn of the 18th century. The only condition was that \"a beautiful building appropriate to the location of the building site be built on the building site within five years of the transfer of ownership.\" \n\r\nThis demand was fulfilled through the construction of a public observatory.\n\r\nThe observatory was completed in 1907 and was the first concrete building in the city, it was also fully separate from the surrounding building to minimize vibrations. Despite this technology, no science was ever done in the tower, instead, it has always been used to teach astronomy and explain how telescopes work. \n\r\nInside the building is a beautiful Zeiss refractor that was custom-built for this tower. The telescope has a length of 16 feet (five meters). It's described by Zeiss as a 'Urania Type.",

Its golden year was 1897, when it scored a record total of a near-million ton of herrings—accounting for six-tenths of that year's national catch.\n\r\nLike a gold rush, the abundance of fish attracted opportunity-seekers and drove them out to sea. Collectively referred to as yan-shū in the north, these fishermen were known for their rough nature and their sea shanty called Sōran Bushi, which continues to be remembered as one of Japan's most iconic folk songs.\n\r\nIn Otaru, the yan-shū lodged in dormitories at massive mansions called Nishin-Goten. Built by the nouveau riche who had made their fortunes from huge catches of herrings, these wooden \"herring palaces\" typically stood on the hilltop by the seaside so that any shoal of herrings was not missed.\n\r\nFew herring palaces have survived over the years, but few of those standing today are herring palaces, technically speaking. A majority of them are either banya, smaller-scale lodges for the herring fishermen, or villas built by the fishery bosses for themselves.\n\r\nStanding on a hilltop along the Ishikari Bay coastline is the Otaru Herring Palace, the \"real\" Nishin-Goten completed in 1897. Initially built in Shakotan, it was moved to its current location in 1958 and is now managed by the Otaru Aquarium as a historic monument and museum.\n\r\nOn display are mainly fishermen’s equipment and old photographs, as well as scenes from Otaru’s fishery past re-enacted by dolls and in dioramas.

In the distance, a caravan of riders is traveling alongside you, driving cattle. These silhouetted figures are known as the \"Ghost Riders of the Chisholm Trail.\"\n\r\nThe Abilene stockyards opened in 1866, providing a new, safer, and shorter route for Texas ranchers to deliver their goods to the north and east. They began to use an old hunting and trading route through indigenous territory, that had been scouted by Jesse Chisholm, a Cherokee merchant, and his friend Black Beaver, a Lenape guide and trader. The trail, which became known as the Chisholm Trail, runs through what is now Highway 81. As the railroad grew, the trail changed shape, eventually ending at Caldwell, before being overtaken by newer, better routes.\n\r\nIn 1995, a group of volunteers worked together to memorialize this era in silhouetted steel. The trail is best viewed at dawn, as the sun breaks over the trail, or at dusk, as the trail figures seemingly come to life as they face the waning light.",

          "description": "It’s no secret that Mississippi is currently America’s poorest state, but that doesn’t mean local residents are just sitting around waiting for their cities to crumble. As downtown Yazoo City struggled with rising vacancy rates and a difficult business environment, local business owners on Main Street banded together and began to fight back with a bold strategy: cans of brightly colored pastel paint.\n\r\nMost of the downtown buildings in Yazoo City date back to the same year: 1904. That was the year a fire ripped through Yazoo City, burning down most of the buildings and forcing it to rebuild. A local legend claims this was the work of “The Witch of Yazoo,” who cursed the town after drowning in quicksand. Others may claim poor fire codes.\n\r\nThese historic buildings fell into a general state of disrepair until the early 2000s, when members of the Yazoo County CVB convinced remaining business owners to paint downtown in various vibrant colors designed to give the town a Caribbean look, or maybe that of a gaudier version of Charleston’s Rainbow Row. \n\r\nThe block is anchored by the historic Main Street Hotel, and its event space, “The No Smoking Smoke House.” From November through early January, Christmas lights are hung on the buildings, lending the town an even more vibrant and colorful pageantry. Main Street still has its share of vacant storefronts, but the town has seen a revival both from the renewed vigor of town, and from tourists attracted by its photogenic exterior.",

          "description": "In the 1960s, Italy was crossed by an economic boom. The paper businessman Luigi Burgo wanted a new factory to host a new, huge, paper machine. The factory needed to be able to expand as business increased. This was a great problem, he needed a 250-meter-long room with a 160-meter-long wall without a pillar (to allow the possible expansion).\n\r\nBurgo called Pier Luigi Nervi to solve the problem. Nervi was an Italian architect who specialized in the Brutalist style. At that time he already built many stadiums, bridges, spot halls and the UNESCO headquarters in Italy. Nervi was in love with the architectural potential of enforced concrete and was already known as the \"poet\" or the \"tailor\" of enforced concrete.\n\r\nNervi decided to approach the challenge in a completely different way, building a bridge-like structure instead of a normal factory building. He built two sets of piers to hold up metal chains that allow the ceiling to \"float\" over the structure without pillars, but with walls made only of metal and glass.\n\r\nBurgo's new paper mill became an iconic structure. It was in use until 2013 when the all company shut down due to low newspaper sales. The factory was used again starting in 2015 after it was taken over by another company.",

          "description": "The Buddhist temple of Ryūkōin was once in possession of a peculiar statue called Kateki. Also honorifically referred to as Kateki-Sonja or Kateki-Sama, it was believed to represent an ancient Chinese polymath, the inventor of sailing vessels who had lived during the reign of the Yellow Emperor.\n\r\nThe wooden statue became a boogeyman at some point, used by mothers to scare their children into good behavior. According to local legend, Kateki was actually the Adzuki-Baba, an old hag characterized by an eerie bean-grinding noise. It was said that Kateki would transform into a badger at night and carry off naughty children into the dark, presumably to feast on them. Children were unimpressed by the stories, however; it is said that they would come barging into the temple and use the statue as a mere plaything.\n\r\nIt was not until 1924 that the true identity of the Kateki statue was finally revealed. It was photographed and introduced to the world at the Vatican expo, garnering attention from historians, who recognized its Erasmian attributes. It was, in fact, a statue of the Dutch theologian and philosopher Desiderius Erasmus—but its historic value was simply underestimated.\n\r\nAs it turned out, the Erasmus statue had once served as the stern figurehead of the De Liefde, originally named the Erasmus, an East Indiaman that set sail from Rotterdam in 1598. Winding up ashore in Bungo Province (today Oita Prefecture), the ship brought some of the first Europeans to reach Japan, including Jan Joosten and William Adams. She was wrecked and lost in time, leaving only the Erasmus statue to survive and somehow end up at Ryūkōin Temple.\n\r\nWhen news broke, the Netherlands offered to purchase the statue, but the Japanese government declined and designated it as a National Treasure. While the temple retains ownership over it, it has been loaned to the Tokyo National Museum, where it goes on display from time to time. A replica of it is permanently exhibited at the Sano City Museum, as well as at the Maritime Museum in Rotterdam.",

          "description": "When settlers first reached the Wyoming Territory, they would often use natural features as lines of demarcation. In what would one day become Campbell County, the first settlers used a rockpile to stake their claim on the land. This settlement became known as Rocky Pile, but when the Burlington & Missouri Railroad arrived in 1891, the town was renamed Gillette after one of their surveyors.\n\r\nThe rockpile continued to be a sedimentary symbol of the town’s fortunes, visible from Highway 16 as Gillette grew and became a mining mecca. Residents were torn between leveling the ground for its continued development and preserving it as part of the town’s legacy. Finally, in 1970, Ralph A. Kintz bought the land and donated it to Campbell County. Four years later, the Campbell County Rockpile Museum opened.\n\r\nIn addition to preserving the rockpile, the museum interprets the history of the Powder River Basin. It contains exhibits on paleontology and geology, as well as firearms, saddles, and spurs from the town’s ranching and cowboy days. Particular interest is paid to Gillette’s heritage of coal mining. At its peak, the Powder River basin provided more than 35 percent of the energy for the entire nation.",

Between 2007-2008, the Delaware Department of Transportation undertook a multimillion-dollar effort to restore the bridge. This included raising the roadway five feet and using highly durable Bongossi wood to better fortify the span.\n\r\nThe bridge was re-opened on December 15, 2008, and has been standing strong ever since.",

          "description": "In 1953, a shoe salesman named Albert J. King, still mourning the loss of his nephew, John Cooper, during World War II, had a proposal for the city of Emporia, Kansas. Why not adapt Armistice Day, a holiday established to honor World War I veterans, into a holiday for all veterans? Through that idea, Veterans Day came to Emporia, and soon after to the entire United States as well.\n\r\nEmporia first celebrated Veterans Day on November 11, 1953. The next year, U.S. Representative Ed Rees, also from Emporia, brought a bill to Congress changing Armistice Day to Veterans Day. U.S. President and fellow Kansan Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954, and the first national Veterans Day was celebrated later that year.\n\r\nAs with much history, this narrative is somewhat complicated by reality. In particular, Birmingham, Alabama, also has a strong claim on Veterans Day, due to the efforts of World War II veteran Raymond Weeks to establish a Veterans Day in 1947. To share credit, Birmingham was named the “first city of Veterans Day” by the Senate, while Emporia was proclaimed the “Founding City of Veterans Day” by the House. Veterans Day, much like success, has many fathers.\n\r\nOn May 26, 1991,  to cement Emporia’s legacy as the home of Veterans Day, a park was opened to honor U.S. veterans of all wars. Displays at the memorial include a World War II M-4A6 Sherman army tank, and a Huey helicopter from the Vietnam War. Tablets of Honor recognize individual veterans through donated plaques. Each year in November, the town observes All Veterans Tribute Week in recognition of all veterans and Emporia's history.",

While he strolled along his quiet, residential neighborhood at the edge of the city center, a green door of a Victorian building caught his eye.\n\r\nThe door was grubby, graffitied, and clearly very old, likely built sometime (like so much of Edinburgh) in the early 19th century. “But what was this door’s story?” Mogg wondered. What kind of lives might it have witnessed?\n\r\nRight there, in front of the eye-catching doorway, Mogg searched the address in the British Newspaper Archive on his phone. Within seconds, he was skimming through stories of past residents. In 1888, a window cleaner had fallen off the building and died. In 1896, a resident died of gangrene after a heavy…",

Some believe that it contains his spirit and that he is always watching the guests enjoy his masterpiece that will never be completed, an ever-growing kingdom of dreams.\n\r\nThough a variant of the legend claims that the lamp has never been turned off since the supernatural incident, it is not quite true, of course, and avid park-goers and Disney historians have noted that the current lamp, as well as the one before it, is a replacement and not the original Walt Disney lamp. Casual guests, on the other hand, may not even know how significant this fire department building is in the first place.\n\r\nThe legendary apartment is not open to the public, and you can only see the lamp from ground level. On special occasions, however, Disneyland Park offers guided tours which include a visit to the upper apartment, a rare opportunity to meet Walt Disney's ghost face to face.",

          "description": "The museum of Manuel is hard to miss from the outside because the plane that landed on its roof really sets the tone. Once you enter past the (slightly loud) buzzer, a happy and proud Manuel is there to give you a warm welcome.\n\r\n\"Three halls,\" he says in a modest way. Once inside you'll turn around and realize your head contains too few eyes to absorb the place in one look. It's beautifully stuffed, arranged by themes and one can see how many years of collecting have gone into this. Past these three halls, the museum expands outside when you go around the corner only to let your jaw drop once again by realizing the museum doubles or even triples size here, just as packed with finds and treasures by Manuel as all the other halls.\n\r\nOpen since 1977, the Musée chez Manuel displays all the finds of this tireless traveler-collector in over 2,000 square meters of exhibition space. Manuel Ribeiro, founder of the museum: “I crossed France as a traveling salesman. One day a farmer gave me a trolley lamp. And I caught the collecting virus.”\n\r\nOn the flyer of the museum (also called Musee d'Art Populaire) it says it shows automobiles, bicycles, motorcycles, pedal cars, old toys and unusual objects. That last term fits best, for this museum is filled with passion and dedication, leaning towards obsession in the best way possible.",

          "description": "In the Souto da Retorta, also known as the Chavín Eucalyptus Forest, near the town of Viveiro in Galicia, there are some of the tallest eucalyptus trees on the continent. The largest and most outstanding among them is O Avó (\"grandfather\" in Galician). A tree of the species Eucalyptus globulus was planted here in 1880 in order to drain the lowlands flooded by the streams of the river Landro.\n\r\nThe eucalyptus arrived in Europe in the 19th century, specifically in northwestern Spain, when a Galician priest brought its seeds from the distant Australian lands where he had been a missionary.  Optimally adapted to the conditions of the humid oceanic climate and spread massively throughout northern Spain where, due to its rapid growth, it has been cultivated to obtain wood and paper.\n\r\nThese eucalyptus plants were the first planted here, and O Avó is the oldest of them, being the biggest tree in Spain, standing more than 67 meters (220 feet) tall.  (There is controversy due to the height of one of the eucalyptus trees that surround it with which it has a close height of a few feet difference) Furthermore it would be the tallest eucalyptus in Europe. \n\r\nA perimeter fence has been installed to protect O Avó, since due to its age, it is affected by various diseases and also to avoid compaction of the ground in its surroundings that could affect its growth.\n\r\nIn 2010, O Avó was elected Tree of the Year by Bosques sin Fronteras (Forests Without Borders).",

As Otaru developed into a major tourist destination over the years, it shifted to producing tableware, ornaments, wind chimes, and the like, branching into a total of 17 locations within the city.\n\r\nOn the bustling Sakaimachi-Dori shopping street stands the Sangokan (\"Building No. 3\"), a historic building constructed in 1891 as a fishery warehouse where local herrings were processed and canned. Trolley tracks from those bygone days, which connected the warehouse to the harbor, are also well preserved, allowing visitors to walk over as an atmospheric corridor.\n\r\nToday, the former warehouse is home to an outlet of Kitaichi Glass, three floors full of stunning glassware, as well as a café called the Kitaichi Hall.\n\r\nSimply put, the Kitaichi Hall is nothing short of magnificence, with a lofty ceiling and wooden beams. Its only source of lighting is 167 petroleum lamps, a few on each table and some on the chandeliers above, giving a warm, nostalgic, dreamlike feel to the place. Along the wall sits a Steinway grand piano, where live performances are held daily from Tuesday to Friday (except national holidays) at 2:00, 3:00, and 4:00 PM.\n\r\nFull of local fare, the menu is well worth a mention, of course. The whipped ice cream and royal milk tea are made from the famous Hokkaido milk, and the parfait is made from haskap, the blue honeysuckle native to Hokkaido. During the lunch hours between 11:00 AM and 2:50 PM, you can also order rice bowls and noodles featuring Hokkaido's signature seafood: crab, salmon, and salmon roe. There's a nice selection of Otaru's craft beer, too.\n\r\nThe petroleum lamps are lit by human hands every morning at 8:45, allowing early visitors to watch the operation before opening for the day at 9:00.",

His father, Eloy Alfaro, who founded the factory in 1923 in Sarchí, Costa Rica, asked his son which craft he wanted to learn to help construct the carts. Out of woodworking, blacksmithing, and mechanics, the young Castro chose mechanics—and 70 years later, he is still diligently constructing oxcarts in the tiny town of Sarchí, masterfully crafting each part by hand with the help of his associates.\n\r\nOxcarts have been commonly used throughout Central America, but those sporting bright colors and intricate patterns are unique to Costa Rica.

          "description": "Deep in a wooded area near the University town of Lampeter, West Wales is an outdoor theatre. Around it, hidden in the woodland are figures of angels and wood spirits carved from the trees. In front of the stage are tiered seats that have been fashioned from the hilly natural slope of the wood.\n\r\nTo the right of the slowly decaying stage next to a poem written in the Welsh language is a poem by Dylan Thomas, Wales's most famous poet. His poem 'Do not go gentle into that good night' was written by Thomas in the knowledge of the death of his father. This is perhaps a fitting tribute to the theatre itself. Parts of the wooden stage have collapsed and other areas are beginning to rot away. It appears to have been some time since a performance was staged at this magical location.\n\r\nLongwood Woodland Theatre started out as part of a community initiative in 2003. An area of woodland was purchased and run as a social enterprise. It became Wales's first sustainable community woodland. Built as a zero-carbon project, it was constructed using timber from the local forest without cement or concrete. Two hundred volunteers took part in the enterprise from local rural communities where social exclusion can be a challenge to young people. One of the aims of the project was to restore non-native plantations to native broadleaf species. Since 2007, 10,000 trees have been planted.\n\r\nThere is limited information concerning how many plays or musicals were staged at the theatre, but it may have fallen into disuse during the Covid pandemic in 2020 where social distancing laws prevented any outdoor gatherings from taking place. Nature has now started to reclaim these spaces. Songs and performances are now only by birds such as Goldcrest and the rare Wood Warblers that nest here.",

The Miller family had been a prominent presence in the community for over a century, funding church repairs and the construction of a village school.\n\r\nMiller was a man of deep faith and often traveled to his villa in Venice, Italy. During his travels, he acquired an impressive collection of religious icons and saintly statues, which he brought back to Froyle and installed in the village's church. Over time, his collection grew larger, and he began placing these beautiful sculptures around the village too, adorning Upper Froyle with 19 unique and highly detailed figures.\n\r\nThanks to Miller's passion for collecting, Froyle was christened \"The Village of Saints.\" To this day, the thatched cottages and redbrick houses of Upper Froyle continue to display these fantastic figures. One of the most charming homes in Froyle is Post Office Cottage, which features a statue of Saint Hubert, the patron saint of hunting, for whom Sir Hubert is the namesake.\n\r\nWhether you're a history buff, a lover of art, or simply someone who appreciates the beauty of charming villages, Froyle and its fascinating collection of saints are sure to capture your heart.",

A 1975 Ford Econoline van named Ghost Dancing sits idle, decades after taking the journey recounted in the book Blue Highways: A Journey into America. \n\r\nThe van was named after the Ghost Dance, first practiced by the Nevada Northern Paiute tribe as a way to ward off American Western Expansion. Author William Trogden published Blue Highways under the name William Least-Heat Moon, harkening to his father's indigenous roots that he used as a guiding principle for his journey.\n\r\nWilliam Least-Heat Moon got divorced, lost his job as a professor at Stephen's College in Columbia, and in 1978 set off on a three-month journey in a circle around the United States to connect with people in small towns such as Why, Arizona, and Whynot, Mississippi. Decades before the #VanLife trend, Least-Heat Moon lived in Ghost Dancing, following the 'blue highways' on his Rand McNally atlas to direct him toward the paths less traveled. \n\r\n\"When you're traveling, you are what you are right there and then,\" he wrote. \"People don't have your past to hold against you. No yesterdays on the road.” \n\r\nIn the Museum Support Center's collections, you can also visit the Grayson Archery Collection—the world's most extensive collection of historical bows and arrows. From six continents, the Grayson collection catalogs the history of archery through indigenous history, various types of mechanical advancements through the ages, and world record-holding bows.",

The artists call this interactive art project the \"Fargo Mario Wall,\" while others may consider it Instagram bait for elder millennials.\n\r\nAlthough now a popular tourist attraction, the \"Fargo Mario Wall\" began life as a semi-guerrilla street art project by an artist couple who went by the handles “Dark Elvis” and “Icky Hiccup.” After an earlier mural project was covered up, the artists were convinced that they had to find a wall for their idea for a mural based upon World 1-1 in Super Mario Bros., and they connected with a Fargo-based community building organization, Folkways to complete the mural in 2018.\n\r\nThe mural consists of the beginning scene of World 1-1, where Mario encounters his first enemy, the Goomba, perhaps the single most-defeated enemy in video game history. Mario is missing from the work, to allow passersby to complete the image themselves. The interactive display allows visitors to choose to either stomp the Goomba, raise their fists to hit the power-up for a mushroom, or both.",

          "description": "Originally established in 598 CE, the Raiden Shrine in the Gunma town of Itakura is known as Japan’s main center of thunder worship, and for centuries, people have prayed to the gods of thunder here for protection from natural disasters.\n\r\nWhile the shrine itself is an impressive sight, with the current building dating back to 1835, it is also home to a hidden gem lying in an annex building just across the road.\n\r\nNamazu-San is a sleek brass sculpture of a catfish with a slight smile, comfortably placed on a long cushion. Guarding him is a group of red demons representing thunder. In Japanese folklore, the giant subterrestrial catfish is considered to be the cause of earthquakes, often subdued by another god of thunder. Since the Middle Ages, this association has been common knowledge and reflected everywhere in Japanese culture, from traffic signs to Pokémon.\n\r\nThe brazen catfish of Raiden Shrine is not only worshipped for protection against earthquakes, but also for his confidence-boosting mojo. The unattended shrine lets visitors take a handkerchief for a donation of 300 yen and wipe Namazu-San with it, rubbing off his charm so that they can take it home for good luck.\n\r\nThe unusual belief and practice derive from a simple wordplay, something Japanese culture traditionally appreciates. To put it simply, “earthquake” and “confidence” are homophonous in Japanese, written as 地震 and 自信 respectively but both read jishin.",

          "description": "Half a mile east of Rosehearty, a ruined castle sits on the slopes of a hill overlooking a sandy bay. Pitsligo Castle was originally designed as a keep dating to 1424. It was then modified in the 1570s by the Forbes of Druminnor. Despite not having a particularly strong or strategically important location, Pitsligo Castle overlooked the shipping route along the Moray Firth coast.\n\r\nScottish historian W. Douglas Simpson described Pitsligo Castle as one of the nine castles of the Knuckle, a term used to refer to the rocky headland of northeast Aberdeenshire.\n\r\nThe castle has an arched gateway in the outer courtyard's west wall, which is marked both with the date 1656 and the coats of arms of both the Forbes and the Eskine families. In the inner court, however, the date is shown as 1663. Several armorial plaques can be found on other inner walls, including the Pitsligo Arms of 1665 and the Royal Arms dated 1577 and 1603.\n\r\nThere is a tall flanking drum tower in the northeast corner of the courtyard. Pitsligo Castle's main tower had three vaulted stories, but since its abandonment nearly everything above the lowest level has disappeared.\n\r\nThe Forbes family made the mistake of supporting the Jacobite cause, and in 1745 their estate forfeited to the crown. Flemish troops led by William Lascelles, looted and destroyed Pitsligo Castle in 1845. Eventually, the roof was removed and the castle fell into ruin.\n\r\nAt some point, it appears that restoration work was begun on the castle. Some of the fallen masonry has been collected into large piles of rubble that litter the inner courtyard. Work currently appears halted.",

As a child, he would help his parents, Frank and Minnie, manage their 160-acre farm. However, by the time Walter was 13, his parents had to sell the farm due to ongoing drought, and Walter moved into Humboldt, where he attended school. \n\r\nWalter Johnson moved with his family to Southern California in 1902, where he began to pick up the game of baseball. An athletic child, he picked the game up quickly, becoming something of a phenom who began to garner attention, first from local and regional semipro teams, and eventually, by 1907, the Washington Senators.\n\r\nThe Senators were a notorious doormat when Johnson joined the franchise, but he so…",

          "description": "The “Mother Road” that helped define America’s love affair with the road trip is now decommissioned, but key parts of historic U.S. Highway 66 remain, and aficionados still trace the route from its origin near the shore of Lake Michigan in Chicago to its unofficial terminus in Santa Monica, California. And though it’s always been understood as a journey heading west, it does go both ways, both beginning and ending in Chicago on the Midwest Coast.\n\r\nU.S. Highway 66 was officially created by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads in 1926 as one of the highways that would make up the network of America’s first Federal highway interstate system. The new system redesignated existing roads in many areas to piece together a coordinated interstate system.\n\r\nAccording to the Route 66 Association of Illinois, Route 66 began in Chicago in 1926 at the intersection of Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue. This initial portion of the highway was renamed Illinois State 4, which ran from Chicago to East St. Louis. With this pre-existing state highway, the Illinois portion of Route 66 was the first to be completely paved and was also the first to replace the existing road with the U.S. highway. In the mid-1950s, the starting point of Route 66 was moved over a block due to a change in Chicago traffic patterns that made Jackson Drive a one-way street.\n\r\nToday, Historic Route 66 begins in front of the Art Institute of Chicago, with a sign on the south side of the street that is almost completely covered in stickers. It ends where it originally began at East Jackson Boulevard and Michigan Avenue with a sign on Jackson Boulevard that is less covered in stickers and much more easily identifiable.\n\r\nAs exemplified in John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath, the route is about more than transportation, it’s about people, their stories, and our collective history.",

          "description": "A broch is a uniquely Scottish Iron Age form of roundhouse fortification usually found in the northern part of the country. There are over 500 brochs in Scotland, mostly distributed between northern and western Scotland and the islands, with only a small handful in the Scottish Lowlands. Edin's Hall Broch sits as part of a very unusual complex.\n\r\nThe hill fort that surrounds the broch predates the broch by about 2,000 to 2,500 years. The broch itself is thought to date back to some time between 0-200 A.D. It has double ramparts which enclose an oval area measuring 135 meters by 75 meters. The ramparts are impressive, in places standing up to 4.5 meters in height.\n\r\nTowards the center of the fort are the remains of a large roundhouse, which would likely have been the most important building in the enclosure prior to the construction of the broch.\n\r\nThe broch stands tucked away in one corner of the hill fort, within an oval enclosure of 58 meters by 54 meters that separates it from the rest of the site. What remains of the thick stone wall hints at its impressive size. A narrow entrance passageway to the west side would have been guarded by two chambers set back in the wall on either side of the doorway.\n\r\nThe walls themselves also held chambers, three of them in almost dumbbell shape. They were sturdy enough to support staircases that rose up between the walls to provide access to the wallhead.\n\r\nWhat makes Edin's Hall so unusual is its massive size. At 28 meters in diameter to the outer wall, it stands much larger than most Highland broch. Some have suggested that it would not have stood as tall as other brochs because of its diameter, but there is evidence that the walls originally stood to twice their current height at around two meters.  There are also suggestions that it possibly was not covered in the same way as other brochs, making it more like a substantial Iron Age roundhouse than a traditional broch.",

          "description": "This area of the Insurgentes Mixcoac colonia (neighborhood) of Mexico City, could well be called \"Little Spain.\" Not necessarily because of a large migrant community from the European country, but rather just because of its street names. Málaga, Santander, Cádiz, and others can be found here, although Seville does not get a street and is instead the namesake of the Plaza Sevilla, a small roundabout with a peculiar monument at its center.\n\r\nThe Fuente de Sevilla (Seville Fountain) was built here in the 1920s, with a design from architect Leonardo Noriega and engineer Javier Stávoli. Noriega and Stávoli are probably best known for the Parque México, one of the city's main parks. Parque México is located in the Condesa colonia, noted for its Art Deco and Art Nouveau architecture, dating to the 1920s and 30s.\n\r\nPlaza Sevilla's fountain follows the same trends, with an almost pyramidal geometric design, decorated with undulating corners and stained glass on all four sides. Near the top, paintings of the Sun and Moon complete the design. The fountain basin is carved in stone, and the designers' names are found on a plaque here.\n\r\nBy the 1970s, the fountain stood forgotten, and for almost 50 years it was vandalized and deteriorated (even losing an original clock). Its renovation was finished in 2020, and since then, it has stood as a small yet significant century-old heritage.",

French in 2022. Originally built as a freight schooner and launched in April, 1871, the Lewis R. French was rebuilt for the passenger trade in the 1970s and has had a second life taking travelers on multi day adventures up and down the coast of Maine.\n\r\nWe’ll hear about Captain Becky’s background and how her father’s love of maritime fiction inspired her to pursue a career that seemed impossible until she learned about the windjammers in Maine. Her stories and experiences will illuminate why cruising on a windjammer is the ideal way to experience Maine...and we’ll find out why Maine is one of the only places in the world where visitors can still have these authentic nautical experiences.",

Cassimatis and his son George left their home on a Greek island to build a new life in Australia. After some time in Sydney, the father-son duo moved north and then west, finally landing in Muttaburra. A.A. and George built a general store in the town in 1918. The small store sold everything from groceries and hardware to automotive supplies. Eventually the Cassimatises expanded into other businesses: icemaking, soft drinks, agriculture, and more. \n\r\nThe store closed not long after A.A. Cassimatis died in 1942. The building became a bank for a time, but in the 1990s, the Cassimatis General Store was restored as a museum celebrating the business that it once was.",

          "description": "The strikingly gorgeous stations of the Tashkent Metro may rival those in Moscow, even considered by some to be the most beautiful in the world. But they remain largely obscure because photography inside the metro was not only strictly forbidden, but illegal until June 2018.\n\r\nEstablished in 1977, the Tashkent Metro is the oldest subway in Central Asia and seventh of the 13 metro systems in the former Soviet Union. It consists of four lines serving 48 stations, each of which is designed after a particular theme. The whole metro was originally planned to be a city-wide nuclear shelter, and the Uzbek government classified it as a military facility, which was the reason behind its decades-long ban on photography. \n\r\nThe metro is home to a hidden underground world of arches and chandeliers, marble columns, and mosque-like vaults. The styles range from classical to retro-futuristic, a legacy of Soviet architecture. Many of the stations are decorated with murals depicting scenes of historic interest, from a wall of blue and yellow mosaic tiles to ceramic reliefs inspired by the poetry of Ali-Shir Nava'i.\n\r\nOne of the most notable stations is Kosmonavtlar (\"Cosmonauts\"), which is themed after space exploration. The architectural designs are inspired by the Milky Way, with specks of glass \"stars\" sparkling through the colonnade. Throughout the station, there are blue ceramic murals of space-related figures such as Ulugh Beg, Valentina Tereshkova, Yuri Gagarin, and even Icarus. The Alisher Navoiy station, on the other hand, leans more towards Islamic architecture, looking like a cyberpunk mosque.\n\r\nThe fourth line of the Tashkent Metro, Circle Line, was only recently completed in 2020, along with the northern terminus of Yunusobod Line, Turkiston. It may not be as retro as the other stations, but it is meant to be a culmination of the metro's history—combining the distinct styles of Soviet and traditional Uzbek architecture, a modern masterpiece.",

Originally planned as part of an open-plan campus in the 1970s, it was later given to the Serbian Orthodox Church by the municipality, leading to tension and disputes.\n\r\nConstruction began in 1992, but was halted multiple times due to a lack of funds as well as a deteriorating security situation in Kosovo. At first, the church was not well-received by all due to being seen as a symbol of Serbian rule. After all, according to Spasoje Krunić's design, the church would have 1,389 golden crosses—a reference to the year of the Battle of Kosovo, which is particularly important to Serbian history, tradition, and national identity at large.\n\r\nAfter the war in 1999, the building survived attempts of destruction and was placed under protection. The future of the church remains uncertain, with ownership still being disputed between the University of Priština and the Serbian Orthodox Church. Calls for demolition have led to vandalism and desecration.\n\r\nThe Eparchy of Raška and Prizren conducted a religious ceremony on the grounds in 2021, sparking criticism and protests. The church, therefore, remains a contentious symbol in Pristina. Originally intended to be a prominent religious structure, it now stands as an urban semi-ruin, protected by a barbed wire fence set up by KFOR soldiers.",

          "description": "The design of the former College Life Insurance Company headquarters, or the Pyramids as they are commonly known, was the brainchild of the famed architect Kevin Roche. For Roche (who trained under Eero Saarinen and designed such celebrated buildings as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Ford Foundation Headquarters), the inspiration for the buildings was a piece of concrete he saw on the side of the road, which resembled a pyramid.\n\r\nAt the time, Roche was working on a design for the College Life Insurance Company in Indianapolis. He thought the pyramidal concrete was an appropriately functional shape for the then-thriving business, which wanted to incrementally add building capacity as the size of its personnel grew. Roche's initial vision was to add additional pyramids as more office space was needed, for a total of nine buildings. However, only three were built during the initial construction period in 1971.\n\r\nThe three buildings, collectively known as the Pyramids, are the most impressive structures on the 200-acre College Park development. Built in a slick brutalist style, each building is constructed of two gleaming blue exterior walls supported by reinforced concrete, which comprise the other two walls. Each pyramid is 11 stories tall, contains over 120,000 square footage, and is connected via a network of underground and aboveground passages. All three overlook a 25-acre lake.\n\r\nToday, the Pyramids are owned by Indiana-based real estate development firm KennMarr and are currently undergoing renovation. Sightseers need not worry, though: the exterior aesthetics that make the Pyramids so iconic will remain intact.",

Known as the Madonna of Peace, it's hidden in a tiny state park (the second smallest in California) right behind the Timber Cove Resort. \n\r\nThe sculpture (also called \"Peace Obelisk\" or \"The Expanding Universe\") is one of several in Northern California by Italian artist Beniamino \"Benny\" Bufano and is an example of his anti-war viewpoint. The sculpture is shaped roughly like a missile, and was created around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was the final of his \"projectiles of peace,\" completed just months before the artist died in 1970.\n\r\nHis first sculpture in the series was a 34-foot-tall monument simply titled Peace. It debuted at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco. Bufano wanted to build another, larger projectile of peace. In the 1950s, he traveled to the Soviet Union and proposed the idea to Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin, who declined the artist's offer.\n\r\nBut when Bufano was commissioned to create a sculpture in Timber Cove in the 1960s, he took the opportunity to create a towering monument to peace. The obelisk was built out of donated materials: redwood, steel, fiberglass, and mosaic tile. It took about a year to build the 68-foot body of the sculpture, but when it came time to place the head on top they found it was too heavy. For years, the head sat next to the base of the incomplete statue. In 1969, a special crane was brought in to lift the head into its rightful place, but it was accidentally placed backward. In February 1970, a second face was installed on the statue. Bufano died just a few months later in August.",

          "description": "Some believe that these ruins gave their name to the nearby pit village of Bearpark.  The belief is the name is a corruption of the French term \"Beau Repaire\" the name given to the Priory.\n\r\nBeaurepaire Priory was originally built by the Prior of Durham in charge of the Priory and Convent of Durham, Bertram de Middleton, in 1258 to be a country seat and his home in his retirement. It was visited by royalty on numerous occasions between 1296 and 1335, with visits by Kings Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III.\n\r\nOver the centuries the priory was expanded several times. It took on a role similar to that of nearby Finchale Priory and acted as a retreat for the monks of Durham. The retreat was popular because, at just three miles from Durham City, it allowed the monks to attend daily mass easily.\n\r\nThe priory was heavily damaged following the nearby Battle of Neville's Cross and subsequently rebuilt and repaired by Prior Fossour. It suffered further during the British Civil War when the Priory was largely destroyed by the attacking Scots, with large assaults in 1640 and again four years later.\n\r\nThe park surrounding the priory supplied it with wood, coal, and building materials. It was also used as a stud for the prior's horses.\n\r\nMost of what is left of Beaurepaire ranges from ankle-high to waist-high ruined walls.  However, there are a few sections that tower over visitors and with imagination it is possible to conceive that this was a once magnificent building.",

          "description": "In Buddhism, the Five Hundred Arhats are the most loyal of the Buddha’s disciples, who attended the religion's first council at Rājagṛha (modern Rajgir) right after the Buddha's final nirvana to compile his teachings into scriptures. Several Japanese and Chinese temples are home to statues of the Arhats, which are said to bring good luck to visitors.\n\r\nOne of Japan’s three most popular arhat temple is Kita-in in Kawagoe, a quaint city about an hour away from Tokyo. Its famed sculpture garden contains a total of 538 statues, including the Great Buddha, Amitabha, Ksitigarbha, and the Bodhisattvas.\n\r\nThey were sculpted in the late Edo period, from 1782 to 1825, at the suggestion of a local monk named Shijo. They have since stood in the temple garden, collecting layers of moss and lichen.\n\r\nInterestingly, the sculptures are not all serious and hard-faced. There is an endearing sense of humor to many of the arhats at Kita-in Temple, a touch of human nature, something even relatable to us living two centuries ahead of them.\n\r\nFor example, one arhat can be seen reclining and taking up his neighbor's space, who appears to be (understandably) annoyed but keeping it cool. Another arhat lies resting his cheeks on his hands, in a manner perhaps resembling that of a teenage girl gossiping at a sleepover. While some meditate solemnly, some are laughing, crying, sneezing, and there is even a monk who is definitely picking his nose.\n\r\nEach of the arhat statues is uniquely sculpted, making it a fun experience to explore the enclosure and enjoy the multi-faceted essence of Buddhist art.",

It had a 30-foot tower, walls nine feet and nine inches thick, and housed three large cannons and one smaller one. A few years later casemates were added, and by 1870, the fort got a major makeover, inspired by the threat of Napoleon III. A new battery was added, able to hold up to 175 soldiers and five officers.

          "description": "In the township of Itakura, Gunma, a bizarre sculpture lurks in the sleepy, poorly-lit lobby of a local community center. \n\r\nAn eldritch entity composed of countless coleopteran corpses in the style of Oogie Boogie, the Konchū Senju-Kannon is the stuff of entomophobic nightmares. Haloed by the iridescent sheen of jewel beetles’ carapaces and crowned with a longicorn cocoon, the goddess sits on a throne of creepy-crawlies with the mandibles of stag beetles jutting out in every direction. At her feet, a swarm of drone beetles make up the pedestal, giving a bronze-green luster to it.\n\r\nNeatly composed of over 20,000 insect specimens, the Konchū Senju-Kannon (\"thousand-armed insect goddess of mercy\") was created over a span of six years by one Mr. Inamura, an Itakura local who pursued the hobby of insect collecting. In Japan, the collector's typical game consists of different kinds of beetles, such as the rhinoceros, stag, and longicorn, quite common in the countryside.\n\r\nBright green with tints of rainbow, the jewel beetle has been highly valued for its rare beauty since antiquity, most notably used in the eighth century to make the Tamamushi Shrine of Hōryū-ji. No doubt inspired by this National Treasure, the goddess of Itakura is also modeled after the Kannon statue enshrined at Tōshōdai-ji Temple.\n\r\nPerhaps ironically, this particular statue is dedicated to all the lives of insects lost at the hands of mankind, be it a victim of pesticide or specimen-making. Known as mushi-kuyō, the practice of memorializing insects is not itself an uncommon tradition in Japanese Buddhism (as seen in Ueno and Kamakura) if not as elaborate as the Insect Goddess.\n\r\nDepending on the viewer, the goddess may be breathtaking or stomach-turning, exquisite or eccentric, a work of goodwill or hypocrisy. Regardless of your opinion, she continues to sit in the shadows in a perpetual state of prayer, full of mercy towards the little creatures.",

          "description": "The Jimbocho district of Tokyo is known for its decades-old cafés. Viennese coffee was first introduced to the Japanese public in 1953 at the Ladrio, one of the java joints situated in a narrow alley. The rich, potent concoction quickly became a favorite spot of countless authors, artists, publishers, bibliophiles, and college students, who liked it as it stayed hot underneath the thick layer of whipped cream as they sat discussing for hours on end.\n\r\nThat same year, the café opened a sister location right across the alley named “Milongo,” which advertised itself as an Argentine tango café. It may seem like a niche genre today, but post-war Japan was in the midst of a dance craze at the time. Its influences are also evident in some of the popular music of the later Shōwa era.\n\r\nMilonga has maintained its musical theme over the years, even after the fever all but died out elsewhere. To this day, it keeps on playing Argentine tango music on vinyl, filling the warmly lit room with comfortable Latin crooning and phonographic crackles. \n\r\nThe café underwent a major renovation in 1995 and renamed itself as Milonga Nueva: the new Milonga. It was now home to charcoal-roasted coffee and numerous brands of beer from around the world, even while the music remained. To this day, the interior is decorated with an impressive collection of vintage LP records, books, bottles and coasters.\n\r\nIn 2023, the Milonga Nueva had to relocate due to the original brick-walled building growing deteriorated from age. Fortunately, it did not stray much farther, spiritually or physically. Even though it's now housed in a newer building, the vibe hasn't changed drastically; Argentine tango still plays all day, and the menu boasts smoky coffee and a good selection of beer, along with its famous pizza, Japanese-style curry, and biscotti.",

The Krakow Arcade Museum brings all of that back to life with a massive collection of over 100 vintage machines.\n\r\nIn communist Poland, a single arcade machine could cost as much as a new car and would cost about .50 Euros to play a machine. Despite that, they were massively popular. Most machines paid themselves off within a month and went on the make a profit after that. \n\r\nA lot of arcade machines lasted well into the 2000s in dedicated arcades or on game trucks that drove to smaller towns and villages.\n\r\nToday, the Krakow Arcade Museum has collected over 100 games ranging from classics, such as Packman, to newer games, such as Dance Dance Revolution. At the arcade, you pay per hour of play. This way you do not have to worry about coins or credits, but can just play whatever you want.",

          "description": "During the 1950s, the new West Berlin government called many famous architects from all across the world to come and rebuild the destroyed city. One of these architects was Le Corbusier. The Swiss-French architect, writer, designer, urban planner, and painter was then at the height of his renown. Le Corbusier, who was born Charles-Edouard Jeanneret, had by then already designed several of these \"Unité d'Habitation\" apartment buildings. The first was in Marseille in 1952, followed by one in Nantes, France in 1955.\n\r\nWhen he presented his plans for the Unité d'Habitation of Berlin to the West Berlin government, the building was deemed too large to be built in the city's center. Eventually, construction began in 1956 in an outer Berlin suburb known as Flatowallee. \n\r\nLe Corbusier and local authorities had more disagreements, however. The original plan of the building called for many community amenities, including such as a kindergarten on the roof and shops on the seventh floor. But those amenities were never built, and instead, giving way to more housing. \n\r\nThe apartments were also altered from Le Corbusier's original plan. German building regulations required the carefully designed spaces to have taller ceilings--something that to Le Corbusier's mind disrupted the balance of the space. \n\r\nEventually, a children's playground was added on the grounds and a laundrette, bank, supermarket, and post office were all crammed into the first floor. But Le Corbusier was already fed up with the project by then and refused to have any association with it.",

          "description": "The Moche civilization, also known as the Mochica culture, was an ancient civilization that thrived along the northern coast of present-day Peru from around the years 100 to 800. Renowned for their impressive artistic achievements, advanced agricultural practices, erotic pottery, and complex social organization, the Moche people left a lasting impact on the region's history.\n\r\nReligion played a central role in Mochica society. They worshipped a pantheon of deities, with the \"Decapitator\" being one of the most prominent figures that was often depicted in their art. Ritual human sacrifices were performed to appease these gods and ensure agricultural prosperity and social order. \n\r\nMoche is also the name of a town located near the city of Trujillo on the northern coast of Peru. While this town is known for its renowned beaches along the Pacific Ocean, a hidden history awaits those who seek it. A pathway adorned with contemporary depictions of Mochica Gods, now winds its way towards these shores.\n\r\nEmbark on a unique journey where each deity comes to life through modern sculptures portraying eerie or awe-inspiring creatures. From the enigmatic half-man and half-crab, to the imposing humanoid evil-looking fish, a total of 10-20 statues bring their stories to life. Each statue is accompanied by informative details about the corresponding deity. (You can find a similar assemblage of statues in the town of Chiclayo, Peru, called the Paseo Yortuque.)\n\r\nAs you traverse this evocative pathway, you'll encounter illustrated arcs that add an extra layer of aesthetic detail. The route culminates close to the ocean's edge, offering a seamless segue for visiting the beaches of Acapulco or Playa de las Delicias.",

It's somewhat similar in spirit to the phrase \"God willing\" in monotheistic cultures, but more hopeful and associated with good luck in general. The word is also commonly used in romantic context, and many Shinto shrines are popular for their influence in en-musubi (\"tying the knot\").\n\r\nTakagi Shrine in Sumida City, Tokyo, is one of the few shrines in Japan dedicated to Takami-Musubi, an androgynous deity of creation and birth, who was born as the second entity in the universe's history according to Japanese mythology. Because of their name, the shrine is associated with the concept of en-musubi, as well as, well, rice balls.\n\r\nIn Japan, rice balls are known as onigiri and omusubi, meaning \"clasped\" and \"fastened,\" respectively. At Takagi Shrine, you can find them everywhere, piles of tiny pebbles with cute faces and seaweed wrappers drawn on them. Hidden like Easter eggs, even in the guardian lion-dog's mouth, the rounded triangles are easily distinguishable and can be also seen in the prayer boards, amulets, you name it. Visitors can also take a tiny \"musubi stone\" home upon purchasing a goshuin stamp.\n\r\nInterestingly, despite the extensive musubi-inspired theming, the shrine's main subject of worship was not Takami-Musubi when it was established in 1468 AD. Prior to the Shinto-Buddhism separation of 1868, the shrine was managed by the adjacent Buddhist temple and originally known as Dairokutensha, dedicated to Dairoku-Tenma-Ō, the \"Devil King of the Sixth Heaven.\"\n\r\nIdentified with the demon Mara, this Buddhist Devil is known as an evil tempter and deceiver of monks. In spite of that, there still are multiple Dairokutensha shrines across Japan. Some believe that they may have been influenced by Oda Nobunaga, the most infamous warlord of feudal Japan, who gave himself the moniker of the Devil King to instill fear into his enemies.",

Commonly known as Sisi, the Empress has long been quite the celebrity in Europe. Her rebellious nature has been depicted in films like Corsage and the chart-topping Netflix series The Empress. Yet, despite her popularity, Empress Sisi’s wedding dress has been veiled in secrecy for almost 200 years. Now, thanks to a series of clues, Austrian researcher Dr. Monica Kurzel-Runtscheiner may have solved the ancient sartorial puzzle.\n\r\nKnowledge of this dress has always been hidden. That’s because journalists, illustrators, or anyone who could chronicle the event were banned from the Imperial wedding.

Eating it is momentarily overwhelming, as it sticks to the roof of your mouth before melting away. Its dense, sticky texture even requires a cheese plane, a special spatula-shaped tool for shaving off long pieces.\n\r\nIt used to be nearly impossible to get brunost outside of Norway, but in recent years, it’s become a craze in an unlikely place—South Korea.

The Montgomerie family was among William the Conqueror's most powerful allies.

The tunnels are full of dining options and various shopping/service locations catered towards the employees of all the offices occupying the buildings above.\n\r\nThe tunnel system has been around for nearly a century. The earliest known tunnels date back to the 1930s. According to the Houston Chronicle, one of the first tunnels connected two buildings owned by former Texas Governor Ross Sterling: the Houston Post-Dispatch and the Sterling Building. The tunnel ran beneath Fannin Street. Around the same time, entertainment entrepreneur Will Horwitz had a tunnel connecting his three theaters, the Travis, the Texan, and the Uptown.\n\r\nAccording to architectural historian Stephen Fox, the idea of a system of shared tunnels came about in 1956, when the Bank of the Southwest was linked to the 1010 Garage and the Mellie Esperson Building. As the city grew in the 60s and 70s, so did the underground tunnels.\n\r\nEach section of the tunnels has its own aesthetic, often an extension of the buildings directly above, which vary wildly from haphazard and dingy to spacious and modern. The tunnels are only open during the weekday business hours.",

And boy, does it do its job well - with the ability to deliver a whopping 250,000 gallons of water per minute.\n\r\nBut let's talk about the real star of the show here: the cake itself. Standing at a staggering 146 feet tall, this tower is like the world's biggest, baddest, most delicious birthday cake. And let's not forget the candles—10 in total, each representing five years of Publix history. And that eleventh candle in the middle? That's for the years to come.\n\r\nThis tower is made up of a whopping 2.25 million pounds of steel, secured by two tons of welding rods, and resting on a foundation of 170 cubic yards of concrete. It's like the Hulk of water towers—strong, sturdy, and built to last. And those candles are no slouches either. Each one stands at a towering eight feet tall and weighs in at a solid 250 pounds. That's like having 10 Shaquille O'Neals perched on top of your water tower.\n\r\nBut perhaps the best part of the Publix Birthday Cake water tower is the way it lights up the night sky. Every evening, the lights at the top of the tower turn on, and that center candle serves as an aerial blinker, like a delicious lighthouse guiding ships to safety. It's a sight to behold, and one that has served as an iconic beacon in the Lakeland community for years.\n\r\nThe tower has become a symbol of the community and a beacon of hope for those who call Lakeland their home. It's a structure that represents the strength and resilience of the people of Lakeland.",

          "description": "It might be a stretch to call this place a botanical garden. Bone menagerie. Pseudo-science workshop. Psychedelic trip through a macabre, outdoor fantasy world would all be more appropriate. But it’s well worth the €10 entrance fee, if only for the bizarre photos.\n\r\nThe island of Bonaire has long been a mecca for scuba divers, especially those who enjoy shore dives. With 63 official dive sites on the main island—marked with distinctive, yellow-painted rocks—and another 26 easily accessed from a boat on the adjacent island of Klein Bonaire, most people choose to spend their time diving and snorkeling along the southern and western coasts and enjoying the excellent seafood restaurants found in the capital of Kralendijk.\n\r\nBut the northern and eastern coasts of this boomerang-shaped island are known as the “wild side”. Windward and rocky, the wild side boasts a national park, blow holes, petroglyphs, and the Bonaire Botanical Garden. This is a privately-owned garden, so don’t expect a national park-caliber tour. Instead, you should expect the unexpected and take most of it with a grain of salt.\n\r\nIf you’re lucky, Manuel, the owner of the garden, will be there to take you on the tour. He will detail his inspiration for many of the art exhibits built from found materials and animal bones, share his beliefs on the healing properties of various plants, and extol the supposed virtues of drinking quantities of seawater daily.",

Variations of this coin would continue to be issued for years after this, up until 1884.\n\r\nA small section in the Bank of Korea’s currency museum, dubbed the Sangpyeongtongbo Gallery, focuses on the history and many varieties of the Joseon dynasty’s most widely circulated coinage.\n\r\nReportedly, the Bank of Korea’s collection once possessed 3,137 different varieties, but it’s estimated that Sangpyeong Tongbo boasted over 5,000 varieties throughout its history, many now lost and undocumented. Originally minted at the Stabilization Office, the coins were later issued by other government offices as well, each variety bearing a different mint mark.\n\r\nIn the mid-18th century, other marks were also introduced, indicating the number of the furnace the coin was cast in. They were represented by a single Chinese character, such as those standing for the Chinese zodiac, the five elements, and the Thousand Character Classic.\n\r\nThe Bank of Korea also boasts a collection of cash-shaped amulets, including the so-called open-work charms. One is even shaped after a pair of fish (or maybe a fish cut open), a fanciful amulet you might not realize it’s even coin-shaped at first glance.",

Sa Huỳnh is one of the few cultures that made ling-ling-o, a type of ancient ring-shaped amulet in the ancient Philippines, using jade imported from Taiwan.\n\r\nFounded in 1994, the Museum of Sa Huỳnh Culture is home to nearly 1,000 locally sourced artifacts, the largest of its kind.

          "description": "Old Colony Tap has all the trappings of a nautical, nostalgia-inducing dive bar, and that's because it is one. Exactly as grungy and historic as it looks, Old Colony has been called a “true surviving vestige of hardscrabble Provincetown.” In an episode of Parts Unknown, Anthony Bourdain popped in for some Wellfleet oysters, describing the haunt as a place “where fishermen eat.”\n\r\nPrior to its tenure as the diviest of dives, the building itself was home to a restaurant called the Ocean Breeze. Manuel G. Cook established Old Colony Tap in 1937, which was bought by the Enos family in 1954. Over the decades, local artists added their own aesthetic touches to the space, often practically on top of one another. James Wingate Parr “painted the walls that weren’t covered with driftwood” claimed one account in 2002, while an artist named Ernesto left his mark with a blowtorch.\n\r\nThe bar's collection of decorative oddities on the walls continued to grow, courtesy of donations by local fisherman. Today, the deliberately weird blend of bric-a-brac, which ranges from tchotchkes to old life preservers salvaged from a World War II merchant ship, is very much part of the charm. \n\r\nOld Colony Tap remains in the Enos family to this day. Whether it's Tuesday at 11 a.m. or Saturday at midnight, you can find a stragglers sidled up to the bar. Admittedly, it's pretty easy to lose track of time once you've spent an hour inside this maximalist time warp of a drinking hole.",

          "description": "Believed to have germinated in 1540, the mighty Wye Oak stood tall and proud in the small town of Wye Mills, Maryland. In 1919, it earned the distinction of being the first tree ever listed in the American Forestry Association's \"Tree Hall of Fame.\"\n\r\nThe Wye Oak inspired the American Forestry Association's Big Tree Champion program in 1925 and was named one of the first National Champion Trees in 1940.\n\r\nWith a circumference of 31 feet a height of 96 feet, and a 119-foot crown spread, it was the largest white oak in the United States and the State Tree of Maryland from 1941 until it was destroyed in a massive thunderstorm on June 6, 2002. It was still producing maturing acorns when it fell.\n\r\nThousands of seedlings cloned from the Wye Oak have been planted across the United States. Locally, there are two at Mount Vernon near Alexandria, Virginia, and another that was planted within the remains of the trunk of the original tree in a ceremony on June 6, 2006. A marker stands near the site of the cloned tree.\n\r\nWye Oak State Park was founded in 1939 and has grown from a single acre to 29 acres, and a small schoolhouse—the second oldest in Talbot County—still stands on the site.\n\r\nAlso on display is a segment of a huge branch that weighed 35 tons and reached almost 50 feet in length. The branch segment is preserved within a gazebo near the back of the main park area.",

          "description": "Long Ya Men, or Dragon’s Teeth Gate, was a craggy granite outcrop that once stood at the gateway to Keppel Harbour in Singapore, near the present site of Labrador Park. Known locally by the Malays as Batu Berlayer (\"sailing rock\"), it served as navigational aids to ancient mariners sailing around this narrow channel, along with another rock on the opposite side.\n\r\nIn the 14th century, the outcrops were recorded by the traveler Wang Dayuan in his travelogue Daoyi Zhilüe. During that time, there was a large settlement in the area that was prone to pirate attacks. It is also said that the rocks assisted Zheng He, a Chinese explorer who navigated around Singapore during his seven voyages to the west. \n\r\nThe more prominent of the two outcrops was known as \"Lot's Wife\" to the British sailors, referring to the Biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Unfortunately, both were blown up in 1848 by Straits Settlements surveyor John Thomson in order to widen the entrance to the new harbor.\n\r\nIn 2005, a 19-foot (6-meter tall) stone replica of Long Ya Men was built near its original site to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's maiden voyage. It was originally designed to replace the nearby Berlayer Beacon, but in the end, the replica was placed a few feet away from it instead, due to the Singapore Heritage Society's objection that the beacon itself was a heritage site.",

          "description": "If a trip through Route 66 involves looking at roadside attractions and “world’s largest” objects, then you could say the town of Vega, Texas is “on brand.” The Milburn-Price Culture Museum has been home to the World’s Largest Branding Iron since 2018\n\r\nEven before the creation of Route 66, Vega had a long ranching history. The XIT Ranch was at one point the largest in the world, with three million acres of fenced-in land across the Texas Panhandle and 150,000 heads of cattle. The brand was designed by Abner “Ab” Blocker, who drew the brand with his boot in the dust when challenged to come up with a design that couldn’t be easily burned over.\n\r\nIn 2018, the Milburn-Price Culture Museum commissioned a 22-foot-long, 3,000-pound branding iron, emblazoned with the XIT brand, created by Greg Conn, the museum’s director. The goal of the iron is to tell the story of the Panhandle’s ranching heritage, while also convincing tourists traveling Route 66 to veer a block off course and spend some time in Vega. The rest of the museum has its own share of treasures, such as a Model T Ford, a working printing press from 1896, and a climbable ankylosaurus sculpture named Hank.",

          "description": "In the town of Shoshone, California, is a unique ghost town of carved-out cave dwellings called Dublin Gulch. In the late 1800s, miners and railroad workers created hillside living quarters in the cliffs. These cave dwellings kept the residents cool during the scorching summer heat and provided insulation from the freezing Mojave Desert winters.\n\r\nMost of these cave dwellings have just one room. However, a few of the homes have multiple rooms, wall niches, and fireplaces with stove pipes protruding from the top of the bluff. One of the dwellings even has a large garage carved out.\n\r\nThe exact dates of habitation aren't known, but \"1870\" is carved largely near one dwelling, and it's believed that people lived in these caves on and off up until the mid-1970s. There are rumors that several Manson family members lived in these caves after Charles Manson kicked them out of Barker Ranch. A well-known Death Valley prospector by the name of Frank “Shorty” Harris also lived in the Dublin Gulch.\n\r\nTo visit Dublin Gulch, it's easily accessible by car (park just off of  Highway 127 near the Shoshone Cemetery) or on foot (walk over from the Shoshone Museum). Most of the dwellings are a quarter-mile up a rough dirt road. They are easy to find and some dwellings are open for exploration. Some of the cave homes are locked or only visible through windows.",

This small museum within the hospital where the procedure took place tells the story of this event and the doctor behind it.\n\r\nThe procedure was performed by Professor Christiaan Neethling Barnard on December 3, 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Barnard and his team transplanted the heart of a 25-year-old woman, Denise Darvall, who had been hit by a car while crossing the street to buy a cake. Her heart went to Louis Washkansky, a 53-year-old man who was dying from chronic heart disease. Washkansky survived the procedure, but died from a lung infection and pneumonia just 18 days after the surgery.\n\r\nFortunately, Barnard did not give up. He and his team found more success over the years, as they refined their technique, making major contributions to the field of organ transplantation. Today, thousands of heart transplants are done every year around the world.\n\r\nThe Heart of Cape Town Museum is a sectioned-off part of the hospital. The rooms have been kept in the original state with wax dummies posing as the operation crew. There are many photos and letters exposed in the museum, as well as a pair of Bernard's boots.",

Rather than wheat, the mill was used to grind tree bark that could be used in the leather tanning process. Van Eyndhoven also bought the house next to the mill, and for the next several centuries, it would house the people who owned and maintained the mill.\n\r\nIn the 1920s, Rijn en Lek was purchased by De Vereniging de Hollandsche Molen (the Dutch Mill Society). With the rise of industrialization, the need for the mill's grinding abilities had faded. But the society wanted to preserve the history that came along with the building.\n\r\nRijn en Lek is often confused with the windmill depicted in a 17th-century painting by Jacob van Ruisdael, titled Windmill of Wijk bij Duurstede. The structure seen in the painting was torn down around 1820, though some of its foundations remain.",

Previously utilized as commercial offices and later as a funeral home in the early 1900s, the house underwent a remarkable transformation in early 2023 when the Mystic Side Opera Company took up residence.\n\r\nAs the company began converting the mansion into an opera house and venue for intimate concerts, an unexpected presence made itself known. The opera's General Director captured a ghostly figure on video, and soon after, the spirit began revealing its presence within the house. From ghostly footsteps to mysteriously illuminated lights (prompting the staff to implement the tradition of leaving a \"ghost light\" on), the enigmatic presence of the house's resident phantom has become an integral part of the opera experience, both for guests and performers alike.\n\r\nMystic Side Opera House in the heart of Malden offers a unique backdrop for an evening of artistic brilliance with an unexpected touch of mystery. The beauty of opera intertwined with the captivating history of the mansion, creates an extraordinary experience not to be missed.",

It quickly became a celebrity enclave when actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks built their legendary home, Pickfair, in 1919. \n\r\nIn 1926 entertainer Will Rogers was appointed the first “Honorary Mayor” of Beverly Hills, and in 1952 the city renamed it Will Rogers Memorial Park in his honor.\n\r\nSmart, tidy, and lush—as befits the local area—it has lawns, rose gardens featuring the celebratory Beverly Hills Centennial Roses, palm trees, a dragon tree, decomposed granite walkways, energy-efficient security lights, an irrigation system, and several signs and plaques.\n\r\nThere are restrooms too, and the men’s one became infamous in April 1998 when singer George Michael was arrested for committing a “lewd act” there—a moment that he parlayed into the video for his song \"Outside.\"\n\r\nIn 2015 the fountain was renamed the Margaret J. Anderson Fountain in honor of the first manager of the Beverly Hills Hotel, which you can clearly see at the top end of the park.",

But as the wee hours approach, almost every restaurant shutters. That is, every restaurant except for Spiritus Pizza.\n\r\nIn 1970, this pie-slinging emporium was but a twinkle in young John “Jingles” Yingling's eye. After visiting his sister in Provincetown, John clocked a comprehensive lack of pizza in town. He'd been running a successful pizza truck in Wildwood, New Jersey, but P-town had more permanent plans for his skills. \n\r\nThe following year, John and his new business partner opened a spot on the now-bustling Commercial Street, where slices served on napkins sold for 25 cents. In 1976, the establishment added an ice cream arm. They coined the slogan “there’s no business like dough business.” John started a family in the 1980s, paving the way for a family business. The shop remains owned and operated by the Yinglings today.\n\r\nWith a local monopoly on the late-night feeding frenzy, Spiritus doesn't need to be delicious to be dominant. And yet, they crank out an undeniably tasty slice. The basic components are simple and satisfying: thin crust with a toasty crunch gives way to oregano-heavy sauce topped in a delicate layer of cheese. Those who prefer an over-the-top chaotic slice can get their fix, too, as there's no limit to the custom pies that Spiritus lets inspired patrons build.\n\r\nUnlike many a midnight munchies spot, Spiritus isn't simply a weekend privilege—they're open until 2 a.m. every single night of the week. Not a pizza person? Firstly, what? Secondly, fret not. Ice cream is also available in abundance. Lactose intolerant? There's coffee, too!",

Two of the groupings lie in a field, while a third is a small distance away in the coppice beyond a dyke. These carved stones probably date to the Neolithic or early Bronze Age, between 3500 and 1000 B.C.\n\r\nThe carved stones at Drumtroddan are among some of the most visible remains of the ancient inhabitants' culture. Cup and ring marks were carefully executed using hard stone tools.\n\r\nThere are at least 84 cup and ring marks, possibly more, at Drumtroddan. This includes over 64 cup marks, some with rings and some without. Cup marks are small depressions, sometimes accompanied by surrounding rings. How many you are able to find entirely depends on the lighting conditions when you visit and how long you are willing to stare at the rock faces.\n\r\nThey are usually found densely covering large expanses of rock. The variety of the carvings at Drumtroddan is striking, with some ring marks forming complete circles, while others are incomplete. Some show a radial groove running from the center of the circle and consist of as many as six rings.  \n\r\nIt is not known for certain why these markings were made, but one possible explanation is that they were territory markers, this is made plausible by the fact they are frequently found in locations with good views of the surrounding land. Other theories about their possible purposes include prehistoric belief systems, mapping, and metal prospecting.  \n\r\nIt is thought that there may be a link to the Drumtroddan Standing Stones found 400 meters to the northeast.",

Lionel Lukin, an inventor from Great Dunmow, is credited with creating the world's first \"lifeboat,\" a self-righting and ever-buoyant vessel that “will neither overset in violent gales or sudden bursts of wind, nor sink if by any accident filled with water.\"\n\r\nDoctor’s Pond served Lukin as the testing ground for his lifeboat models, which, though unrecognized in his time, went on to revolutionize water rescue operations.",

Created by the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum, which carved out the whole canyon that surrounds the strange stone outcroppings, these two stones are called \"Karl og Kerling.\" The name translates to \"husband and wife.\" The pair of stones stands near the mouth of the biggest cave in the canyon. The canyon is known as Jökulsárgljúfur.\n\r\nAccording to Icelandic folklore, the married trolls started to argue as they made their way home one evening. But the pair soon lost track of time and night turned to early dawn. The trolls, still in the heat of the argument, didn't notice the rising sun. When the sun finally crested the nearby hill, the sunlight turned the trolls to stone. Trolls, of course, are nocturnal creatures.\n\r\nThe trolls weren't far from the cave they called home when the sunlight petrified the beasts. Still today, on the opposite side of the river, you can see the entrance of the cave called Trollahellir, the \"troll cave,\" where the pair slept.",

Eventually, they smelled food cooking in the village, but no one ever brought any to share with the mother and daughter.\n\r\nDesperate, Fonueau and Salofa left their home and went to the ocean. Together, they jumped off a cliff and into the water, where their bodies were transformed into those of a turtle and a shark. They swam and swam, and eventually arrived at the village of Vaitogi, where they emerged from the water and resumed their human forms. The villagers welcomed Fonueau and Salofa warmly, offering food and clothing. They returned to the ocean but lived just beyond the cliffs, and returned to the village often.\n\r\nAs the story goes, the pair gave the villagers a song that could be used to call them from these rocks.",

          "description": "Provincetown, or P-town, is perched on the tip of northern Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Sure, the Mayflower arrived here in 1620, but this seaside haven is full of less-expected, more colorful surprises. Today, it's a vibrant getaway for gay men and artists.\n\r\nIn between P-town’s iconic eras as a pilgrim dock and an LGBTQ+ party destination, a steady stream of Portuguese seafarers arrived. In the late 1800s, they introduced the Cape to linguiça sausage, pastel de natas, kale soup, and other culinary delights from the western boundary of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\r\nIn 1936, one of these Portuguese families took over an existing bakery at 299 Commercial Street. Their expansive repertoire of breads, flaky pastries, buns, and malassadas have beckoned passersby inside ever since.\n\r\nWhat’s a malassada, you ask? The phrase mal assada means “undercooked” in Portuguese, which refers to the fried sweet’s golden-brown exterior that gives way to a soft, doughy inside. At Provincetown Portuguese Bakery, they arrive still hot, with a generous coating of cinnamon sugar. Immigrants from Portugal have debuted this treat around the world to hyper-enthusiastic results (case in point: in Hawaii, the holiday that most anglophone Catholics call “Fat Tuesday” is known as “Malasada Day”.)\n\r\nAs the institution has changed Portuguese hands over nearly nine decades in service, family recipes have continued to join the canon of carbs on offer. According to the current owners, a few of the baked goods are the product of recipes from the original bakery’s founders, circa 1901.\n\r\nWhile the linguiça-stuffed croissant and lemon-scented pastel de nata are worth penning home about, Provincetown's finest and only Portuguese bakery knows that the way to hook customers, no matter where they're from, is to proudly fry dough in the front window of the bakery. You can’t (and won’t want to) miss it.",

The mechanism inside was made by Franz Morawetz, the court clockmaker of the time. The clock is designed as a linear clock, where figures move along a scale covering an hour period of time, to be replaced by the next figure for the next hour. The figures are moved by a chain drive. The hour is marked in Roman numerals above each figure's head, while the minutes are read along the scale.\n\r\nThere is a chart to the side that identifies each character which includes Marcus Aurelius, Charlemagne, and various Austrian figures of historical importance including Empress Maria Theresa.\n\r\nThe clock marks each hour with organ music, each hour has a different piece associated with the figure; For example, Joseph Haydn is represented by his own \"The Creation.\" Then at 12 p.m., all of the figures are presented in a parade with music.",

His work can be found in the most important galleries around the world in cities such as London, Paris, and New York. One location that doesn't quite fit here: King City, Ontario. However, this small town is inextricably connected to Serra's art: The town even has a street named after him.\n\r\nKing City is the home of a potato farm that Serra visited in 1970. A friend of his owned the land and paid him to complete a sculpture on the property. The completed sculpture, entitled Shift, is one of only two works that Serra ever created in concrete.\n\r\nIn the over 50 years since Serra created Shift, it has been forgotten and then subsequently rediscovered. Today the work is protected by the Ontario Heritage Act. Nonetheless, the work has been reclaimed by nature. The concrete is beginning to show cracks and tall grasses obscure the work. In the spring or summer, the sculpture is surrounded by flowers and wild raspberries. \n\r\nThrough a fluke of fate, King City is home to one of the rarest works from one of the 20th and 21st century's most important artists.",

          "description": "Looking for a remote destination in central China? Look no further than the grottoes at Bingling Temple in the country's north-central Gansu Province. Massive crowds are a common feature of many attractions throughout China: This is a good spot to escape the crowds. The temple is tucked away in a little-traveled, remote corner of the country. \n\r\nThe temple complex is massive, featuring 183 caves and niches, 82 clay sculptures, almost 1,000 square yards of frescoes, and 694 carved stone statues. The temple was built in 420 during the Western Qin Dynasty. Over the centuries, more and more cave temples were excavated and others were added to. Some of the painted frescoes in the caves date back to the Ming Dynasty, which lasted from 1368 to 1644. The site also features a giant Buddha carved into the rock face.\n\r\nNo roads are available to get to Bingling Temple, so you need to take a boat to reach the site. Large tourist boats leave from the outskirts of Liuxiajia in Yongjing County. Smaller motorboats are also available. These boats transport you from the Liujiaxia Reservoir toward the Yellow River and finally to the secluded cove of Bingling Temple. \n\r\nIf you are lucky, you may have the entire place to yourself. But, as with most places in China, you are never truly alone: CCTV cameras guard against looting and vandalism. Some of the more delicate frescoes have been put behind glass enclosures. A walkway will guide you to the main attraction, the colossal Great Maitreya Buddha.",

Back in the Upper Palaeolithic era, it was once occupied by man. Prehistoric artifacts such as flint tools and woolly mammoth bones have been unearthed within and around the caves, in addition to several animal bones.\n\r\nIt is not known how it got its name, but the Herefordshire area is well-known for its association with Arthurian legend, and the cave has some folklore related to King Arthur. According to a popular legend, the cave was fortified by King Vortigern in his battle against the Anglo-Saxon invaders, only to be besieged and taken by Aurelius and Uther Pendragon (Arthur's father).\n\r\nIn 1695, a skeleton of a \"giant human\" was reportedly discovered in the cave by a local goatherder. Unfortunately, however, it was lost when a Bristollian surgeon named Mr. Pye took it with him on a voyage to Jamaica, and his ships sank at sea.\n\r\nToday, the nearby area is occupied by willow and birch trees. The cave is now home to bats and spiders, among other small animals, and probably no more giants or mammoths.",

One of the best-known inhabitants is Johannes Vermeer, the 17th-century painter behind paintings like Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Milkmaid.\n\r\nWhile many may expect a grandiose tomb, in fact, Vermeer's burial place is simply marked by a small tombstone on the ground. Though some have guessed that the tombstone is so small because Vermeer was buried upright, in actuality, the stone was placed long after his death in 1675. \n\r\nVermeer had been buried in a family crypt in the church. When he died, there was not enough money to pay for a separate tombstone. But as Vermeer became more well-known, many people visited his grave, and the stone was put there to satisfy visitors.\n\r\nIn 1975, on the 300th anniversary of the painter's death, a new marker was installed around the location of the former family grave. A larger one was put in place near the church's western entrance in 2007.",

Erected by Southside Granite Co.\"\n\r\nSo what's the deal with this bite-sized block? In 1964, it was given the title by the \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\" Once it held the title, the Camellia Garden Club of Dothan honored the site with a small marker. The block originally measured about 20 feet by 20 feet by 9 feet, It even had a building on it at one point. Now the block is even smaller than it once was. The change wasn't officially made to defend the title, but it would certainly be hard to find a smaller block than this.\n\r\nDothan might be better known as the “Peanut Capital of the World.”",

As the name suggests, the memorial was built in honor of the civilians killed during the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War II.\n\r\nDuring the short period of occupation (1942-1945) thousands of ethnic Chinese were killed in the Sook Ching Massacre. The massacre was a bloody effort to remove anti-Japanese elements from occupied Singapore. As part of this \"removal,\" Chinese men between 18 and 50 years old were forced to report to the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military police. The Japanese reported a death toll of around 6,000, but the official estimates put the number of dead much higher, with a range between 25,000 and 50,000.\n\r\nPrime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, set aside a plot of land in March 1963 at Beach Road for a memorial dedicated to the civilians killed by the Japanese forces during the occupation of Singapore. A competition was organized to find a suitable design for the memorial, with the winning design coming from a representative of Swan and Maclaren Architects.  \n\r\nThe four identical pillars stand 70 meters tall, they represent the shared experiences and unity of the four major races that make up Singapore's population: Chinese, Eurasian, Indian, and Malay. The four towers of the memorial have been described by some as resembling four giant chopsticks giving it its local nickname.\n\r\nBefore the completion of the memorial, a ceremony was held during which 606 urns containing the remains of thousands of unknown civilian victims from mass graves were reinterred on either side of the memorial podium.",

Rita the Rock Planter, a benevolent creature made entirely of recycled wood, is his 119th troll sculpture. Currently, his mythical creations reside in 17 different countries around the world. \n\r\nRita the Rock Planter, who was unveiled on August 4, 2023, can be found near an old 19th-century gold mine. According to the sculptor, the kindly troll noticed all of the holes in the ground and worried about humans or small creatures falling into them. She can be seen patching up the Earth, presumably as a symbolic representation of the damage humans have caused to their natural environment. \n\r\nWhile Rita the Rock Planter may be an unusual sight, she's not alone in Colorado. Isak Heartstone, also known as the Breckenridge Troll, is another such fantastical being in the state.

Alongside this animal kingdom exist spirits, beings, and entire worlds out of sight and out of reach to humankind. The Indigenous Tikuna elders who inherited these forests and rivers tell tales of seductive shapeshifting dolphins and large hairy human-like creatures that stalk the forest. There are legends of entire cities built under the river's surface, where pink dolphins and turtles live.\n\r\nThe Natütama Foundation is a non-profit organization that works with the community of Puerto Nariño to develop research, education, and conservation initiatives combining cultural and scientific knowledge and practices.\n\r\nAs part of this mission, they built the Centro de Interpetación (Environmental Interpretation Center). An education center and museum consisting of two permanent installations depicting different phases or aspects of the Amazon rivers environment that are difficult to witness in the wild. One exhibition is based on the flooded rainforest, which depicts, using wood carvings by local artisans, scenes of wildlife beneath the water's surface and among the trees. Here you can see life-sized carvings of pink river dolphins, river otters, and various fish species. These include the iconic pirañas and the pirarucu, which is the largest fish in the Amazon and a staple of the local diet.\n\r\nAnother building holds a pitch-black room. Barefoot, you step in and are guided through a recreation of an Amazon beach scene at night. A guide uses a flashlight to illuminate the room while recounting a local legend about a fisherman’s encounter with a river dolphin in the dead of night.",

What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? \n\nOne is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. \n\nSimilarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.",

(pp. 264-265) you repeatedly write \\pi^{-1} instead of (presumably) \\pi^\\sharp when talking about pulling back functions.\r\n\r\n2) In the discussion immediately after Theorem 18.1.2. (cohomology of line bundles on projective space) you mention that its top cohomology group is generated by the homogeneous degree-m Laurent polynomials in (x_0 ... x_n)^{-1} k[x_0 ... x_n]. After following the calculations in section 18.3. I feel like it should be the module of homogeneous degree-m Laurent polynomials, in which every variable appears in negative degree, i.e. the degree-m part of (x_0 ... x_n)^{-1} k[x_0^{-1} ... x_n^{-1}].",

Is this also a sufficient condition for flatness over DVR? My only confusion is what if the closed fibre has torsion/nilpotent elements! the \"limit statement somehow does not say anything about nilpotent elements. Please let me know what I am missing.",

In particular a periodic signal. It's an old, unsolved problem, with a lot of literature. And various hacks that are popular in the exoplanet community (and binary-star community!). My position is very simple: Since all methods for determining significance are flawed, and since when you fit a signal you have to estimate also an uncertainty on that signal's parameters, the simplest and most basic test of significance is the significance with which you measure the  of the proposed signal. That is, if the amplitude is well measured, the signal is real. Of course there are adversarial data sets I can make where this isn't true! But that's just a restatement of the point that this is an unsolved problem. For deep reasons!amplitude",

But O−C has this terrible property, which is that the C part depends on the period or frequency you assume. You can completely change the appearance or morphology of an O−C plot just by slightly tweaking the period. And there is no true period of course! There is just whatever estimates you can make. Which are, in turn, affected by what you use to model the O−C. So it is absolutely awful in every way. Not a stable observable, people! Not even .identifiable",

Just create a function that evaluates A.x for any input x. That should be way faster, because of less memory allocation, and because you don't have to make the parts of the matrix that are all zeros (for example).

          "description": "Following some experiments and rants over the last few days with Nora Eisner (Flatiron), I wrote down today an algorithm for a hacky replacement of the Lomb–Scargle periodogram. This periodogram method has various bad pathologies, the worst of which is that it presumes that there is exactly one frequency that fully generates the data. If there are two, the assumptions are broken and the good properties are lost.\nNot that my alternative has any good properties! It is like the radio interferometry method called : It involves iteratively identifying frequencies and fitting them out. It's terrible. But it might be better than some of the wacky hacks that people do right now in the asteroseismology community.CLEAN",

The deal is: Citizen scientists find candidate planets and (currently) a human (Eisner) has to vet them, to remove contamination by various sources of false positives. This turns out to be a hard problem! When problems are hard, it becomes critical to very precisely specify what you are trying to achieve. So we spent time discussing what, exactly, it is that Eisner needs from a classifier. Is it to find good planets? Is it to remove obvious contaminants? Are some contaminants more problematic than others? Is it to save her hours of wall-clock time? PlanetFindersEtc.",
