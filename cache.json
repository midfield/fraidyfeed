          "description": "Driving down a gravel road in rural Missouri, the last thing you would expect to see are several pair of shoes dangling above your windshield, but this is exactly what you will encounter while driving down this rural Perry County road. \n\r\nThe tree is just on the north side of the roadside ditch on County Road 324.  The origins stem from a trip taken in the early 2000s by the landowners to the state of Nevada where they encountered a similar tree with many pair of shoes dangling from the branches.\n\r\nThe man chose a tree close to the road on his property and flung a pair of shoes in it. At family gatherings, he encouraged his descendants to do the same. Now it has become a point of curiosity.\n\r\nThere are so many shoes in the tree it would be difficult to count. Some people make a wish before throwing their shoes, others write messages on their shoes like \"self-doubt,\" \"weight troubles,\" or a bible verse. The various types of shoes in the tree show a variety of footwear worn by the throwers. There are football cleats, running shoes, work boots, and basically anything that can catch itself on a branch in the tree.  Then there is the act of throwing, which is the best for getting the shoes attached without spending all day throwing them up in the air only to see them fall back down.",

          "description": "For at least a decade, a giant Buddha statue has watched over a stretch of U.S. 101 in Redwood City, California. The statue is not part of a temple complex or a garden. Instead, it is perched on top of a concrete shelter filled with dumpsters, in an office parking lot.\n\r\nIts origins are a mystery, but it must have been quite the feat to transport and situate the massive statue on top of the concrete shelter. It faces away from the parking lot and gazes out over the freeway.\n\r\nDespite the unusual location, the statue has become a site of worship. Visitors leave gifts along the statue's base, ranging from bottles of water to sticks of incense. Most drivers rushing through their commutes below likely have no idea that the watchful Buddha is sitting in such a humble spot.",

          "description": "Walking through the bustling Cape Town waterfront, you will see many old and new buildings, many of which have a maritime history. Perhaps one of the most important of these buildings is a tiny unsuspecting tower with a large ball on top of it. \n\r\nThis tower, aptly called the Time Ball Tower, is an 1894 time device similar to the one in the Greenwich Observatory in the United Kingdom, which was used to give a visual signal of the time to ships in the bay, as this was much more accurate than an auditory signal like those of the noon gun, simply because sound travels much slower than light. This was a vital task, as a ship's clock (or chronometer) was needed for navigation, and any drifts could blow a ship off course or worse.  \n\r\nThe tower was initially built on the former Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, but an 1860s expansion of the harbor obscured the old tower, which created the need for a new one. Initially this was a wooden tower, which was later replaced by the current model in 1894, which remained in use for another 40 years. \n\r\nSince then the need for time balls dwindled, and so did their maintenance. The tower was used for a while as a signal repeater for the area, until it was declared a monument and restored in 1997. Since then the time ball has been operational again, and used on occasion.",

The San Ginés Book Shop is actually one of the oldest bookshops in Spain. It is situated in the scenic Pasadizo de San Ginés, between Calle Arenal and Calle Mayor, near the parish of the same name and Chocolatería de San Ginés\n\r\nIts beginnings can be traced to the 17th century when Diego Logroño, the first known bookseller, started his business in 1650.\n\r\nOld and used books are the store's expertise. Unique and exceptional copies are blended with city guides and political references on the tables set up at a street level, which—combined with the fantastic opportunities at reasonable prices—make this book sanctuary a haven for both collectors and curious shoppers.",

Such creatures didn’t typically visit her region in central India—they were known to stay further north in more forested habitats—and so, out of curiosity, Duru and her neighbors walked down to see them.\n\r\nThe elephants rested in the water as people jostled at the shore, trying to get a closer look. Others climbed trees for a better view. After an hour of savoring the thrill of seeing such large animals, Duru headed back home. She was not sure when she would see them again.\n\r\nInstead, that same day, a herd rampaged through the village’s farms. “They tore our boundary wall and tore up…",

The monument was built in 1970 as a replacement for the original, much smaller, monument that was placed in 1930.\n\r\nThis piercing, brutalist piece commemorates the Battle of Bergendal which took place in  August 1900. Thousands of British and Boer forces battled in what was the last set-piece battle of the Second Boer War. The battle resulted in the retreat of the Boer forces, more than 400 casualties, and Lord Roberts declaring the entire South African Republic as British territory. \n\r\nThe site is difficult to miss when passing from either direction on the N4. An additional monument sitting behind the main one also commemorates the lives of the British forces that were lost. There is some signage giving background on the events of the battle, but due to sun damage, it's difficult to read. The names of the lives lost on both sides remain forged on granite plaques around the memorial.",

          "description": "Cine Doré, inaugurated in 1912, is a modernist building that holds 1,250 spectators. The building underwent its first of many renovations in 1923 by architect Críspulo Moro Cabeza.\n\r\nThe building lost part of its original glamor during the late 1930s and became a rather unattractive place, and for some time it was even known as the Sunflower Palace. \n\r\nThe façade is in a modernist style with six Ionic columns and a medallion surrounded by flowers. The Municipal Corporation acquired the cinema in 1982 and the Ministry of Culture used it as a stable location for projections for the Spanish Film Library.\n\r\nThe restoration by architect Javier Feduchi began in 1982 and ended in 1989, with the cinema inaugurated on February 28 of the same year. There are two theories about the origins of the name, one attributing it to a tribute to Gustave Doré and the other to the first two musical notes.\n\r\nIts most recent restoration was led by the architect Javier Feduchi, who preserved the decorative and architectural elements of the old building adding a second room at the bottom.\n\r\nSince 1989, the Doré Cinema has served as the Spanish Film Library's projection space. It is used for both its programming and a variety of outreach initiatives that promote Spanish cinematography and cinema in general.",

          "description": "Not a lot of historic landmarks in Vientiane remain in their original forms, having been numerous wars and invasions—particularly the Siamese onslaught of 1827 and the Indochina Wars that lasted for 55 years. A few exceptions are Wat Si Saket, a Buddhist temple built in 1818, and That Dam, an ancient stupa steeped in legend.\n\r\nStanding in the center of a roundabout near the Talat Sao morning market, the stupa is believed to be around 500 years old, though the exact date of construction remains uncertain. The name That Dam (not that dam) means “black tower” in Lao, based on its current status. However, it was not always darkened and overrun with weeds; local legends claim that it was once gilded over and that the gold was all stripped away by the Siamese invaders.\n\r\nGenerally, stupas are built to enshrine Buddhist relics, most often the ashes of monks and nuns, sometimes of kings. In the case of That Dam, it is unknown what is buried inside, but locals whisper of an intriguing legend. According to them, lying dormant underneath the stupa is the Naga, a seven-headed serpent that will awaken whenever Vientiane faces a crisis. Many of them believe that it has protected the city from the 1827 invasion, as well as on other historical occasions.\n\r\nThe stupa has fallen into disrepair since the Naga last showed itself, weather-worn and all but neglected, but there are still believers in the powerful serpent. In fact, some locals seem to continue to visit the ancient monument to dedicate flowers to the forgotten guardian of Vientiane, in hopes that its peaceful slumber will never again be disturbed.",

          "description": "Between Nashville’s iconic Music Row and Vanderbilt University, Sarabha's Creamery, the city's first homemade Indian-style ice cream shop, quietly works sweet, frozen magic from the second story of a nondescript strip mall. It’s the passion project of husband-and-wife duo Gursharan Singh and Manpreet Gill, who opened the parlor in 2022 after leaving jobs in tech. As Gill explained in an interview with Nashville Scene, the pair saw the empty storefront and decided to make the switch almost immediately. \n\r\nThe mango kulfi—reminiscent of a tropical creamsicle—is the perfect starter to a multi-course ice cream feast, and comes in flavors like malai (with cardamom and milk solids) and kesar pista (saffron with pistachios). It melts quickly, so it’s both logistically sound and extremely satisfying to lick it off the stick as quickly as possible. \n\r\nThe rest of the ice creams are equally stellar. Sarabhas’s incorporates less air into its Indian-style ice cream than a typical American scoop, giving it a texture more akin to gelato. Pair flavors such as rose tutti frutti, cardamom-scented Indian coffee, and paan nawabi (made with rose petals and cashews) in a crispy waffle cone or bowl, then wash it all down with a steaming masala chai.\n\r\nVisually, the star of the show is Sarabhas' vibrant falooda, which arrives brimming with malai ice cream, sweet basil seeds, vermicelli noodles, and jellied fruit bobbing a cup of ice-cold milk, all finished with a cherry and a swirl of fuchsia rose syrup. Originally invented in Persia more than 2,500 years ago, faloodeh is a dessert made from frozen vermicelli soaked in a rose syrup. Persians began arriving in India during the 8th century, so faloodeh had plenty of time to catch on, attain royal status, and then morph into a popular milkshake-like dessert, all while retaining almost exactly the same name—falooda.",

Customers now have the option to dine on a covered patio area next to the old trolley, but the interior of the diner remains a time warp. \n\r\nThe concise menu sticks to the classics—Frito chili pies, wings, fried chicken plates—and does them well. But the cheeseburger, Brown's claim to fame, is what an old-school fast food burger aspires to be: a slender patty with a hint of char on the outside and a pink interior, blanketed in American cheese and Duke’s mayo. It costs less than $10, tastes like a million bucks, and can (and should) be ordered alongside a basket of ultra-crispy Tater Tots.\n\r\nThe diner also bears the unusual distinction of having Nashville’s oldest beer license. Throughout its lifetime, generations of recording artists—from John Prine to Vince Gill—have played on its small stage and knocked back a cold one at the bar.",

          "description": "During the final years of World War II, the Nazis forced thousands of prisoners to carve out an elaborate system of tunnels under Silesia's Owl Mountains. Almost all documentation related to the project was destroyed before the German surrender, meaning that the purpose and the true extent of these tunnels, codenamed Project \"Riese\" (or \"Giant\"), remain shrouded in mystery to this day.\n\r\nThe secret tunnels under Silesia have attracted numerous treasure hunters over the years, convinced that somewhere under this low mountain range lies a trove of Nazi loot. Theories about the true purpose of the Silesian tunnels range from a secret underground train system to transport stolen gold and other treasures, to the final hiding place of the Amber Room, to a covert weapons lab working on the \"Wunderwaffe,\" a top-secret new weapon under development by the Nazis.\n\r\nMost historians now believe that the tunnels were probably an attempt to move key factories underground and away from Allied bombing raids, but this hasn't stopped others from searching further. The full extent of the Nazi tunnel system under Silesia has yet to be uncovered, and the region continues to attract treasure hunters from all over the world, looking for new stores of Nazi gold.\n\r\nThe tunnels were abandoned after the war, and for several decades, only experienced cavers and treasure hunters dared to explore the many underground complexes dug out during Project Riese. Beginning in the 2000s, however, many known sections of the tunnels have been secured and opened to the public. The most famous of the Silesian tunnels are the ones under Ksiaz castle, but more than a dozen other self-contained tunnel systems have been discovered throughout the Owl Mountains, notably in the modern Polish towns of Osówka, Rzeczka/Walim, Soboń, Jawornik, and Włodarz.",

From the fried chicken and waffles to the shrimp and grits, there’s no dead weight on the short, sharp menu at Yay Yay’s, but if you only have stomach capacity for one item, a biscuit needs to be a part of it.  \n\r\nChef Charlotte Miller, who built up a reputation through catering for years, opened her first brick-and-mortar along with her business partner Jason Luntz in 2022. From its location on Jefferson Street, a historic commerce hub, to the wall murals, to the thoughtfully curated selection of books by Michael Twitty, Toni Tipton-Martin, and others, every facet of her café is a celebration of Black history and culture in Nashville. The airy, welcoming interior is ideal for a leisurely brunch or afternoon tea.\n\r\nThe “Can You Say Yay Yay?” with fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, and pimiento cheese on a biscuit is absolutely as much of a triple-threat as it sounds like. The whole concoction is structurally unsound in the right way, with a biscuit crumb so ethereal that it begins to disintegrate almost as soon as it hits your fingers.

          "description": "Tinside Lido is a famous outdoor swimming pool complex located on the waterfront in Plymouth. It holds historical significance as a Grade II listed building, adorning the city's edge to the English Channel. \n\r\nThe lido was opened in 1935 having been designed by the architect John Wibberley. It features an iconic Art-Deco style, with sleek lines, curved edges, and a stunning white façade. The design was influenced by the \"ocean liner aesthetic\" renowned during that era, with many of the U.K.'s seaside towns building lidos in the 1930s as an ode to the rise of popularity in sport and fitness. What makes this lido a must-visit is its heritage and beautiful curves, telling of history in its peeling paint and quaint 30s signage.\n\r\nOver the years, Tinside Lido has undergone periods of closure and renovation to maintain its historic charm and functionality. Like other lidos, it has had periods when it was abandoned and out of use. Fortunately, Plymouth's Tinside Lido is one of the lucky lidos that has not been subject to demolition.\n\r\nIn 2003, the Tinside Lido underwent a major restoration, preserving its original features while incorporating modern facilities and amenities. Since then, it is functional in the summer months as a full-blown swimming pool that can be entered with a small fee.",

          "description": "In 1944, the Jewish people in Budapest, much like those before them in major cities across Europe, were forced to live in a small 20-block area of the 7th district. Many tourists today will learn about the plight of Hungary's Jewish citizens through the history of the Dohány Street Synagogue (The Great Synagogue), the Holocaust Memorial, and the Hungarian Jewish Museum. There are also some more subtle remnants of the impact of the Nazi pogrom on the people of Budapest, if you know where to look.\n\r\nOne of the more hidden memorials isn't entirely authentic, but its location is. The wall surrounding the Jewish ghetto was erected in November 1944 and destroyed in 2006. However, the 30-meter section that sits at the back of the courtyard at 15 Király Utca was reconstructed in 2010 (minus the original barbed wire) to serve as a permanent reminder of the tens of thousands who were forced to live in the area. You can find carefully placed stones and votive lamps along the wall in memory of the people who were interred there.\n\r\nA small plaque on the street describes the memorial wall in Hungarian, English, and Hebrew. Getting to the wall itself requires entering the courtyard of the private apartments currently occupying the location. Pass through the courtyard and continue out through the short tunnel to a second courtyard to find the remains of the wall and a small plaque showing a map of the original ghetto.",

This former international border is today overgrown with thick forests that conceal many old, fortified border crossings and bunkers which have become popular landmarks for local hikers.\n\r\nOnly one of the original border markers from the Versailles era has survived to the present day, and it stands in a public park in the Polish village of Wierzbno. It's engraved with the date of the Versailles Treaty—June 28, 1919—as well as a \"P\" for Poland and a \"D\" for Deutschland (Germany). The actual border crossing was located about one kilometer further east along Poland's national road 24 where the Lubusz Voivodeship meets the Wielkopolska Voivodeship, and is commemorated with a small monument, an information board, and some crumbling ruins of the customs buildings that used to stand there.",

Dragons adorn businesses throughout the city center and comprise some of the city's most prominent statues. Depending on the time of year, you may even be lucky enough to see one hoisted from city hall.\n\r\nAccording to local legend, in 1006, shortly after Trutnov was founded, two stonecutters stumbled upon a dragon's den while searching the woods for building materials. They rushed back to town and informed a local knight, Lord Albrecht von Trautenberg. Although he was skeptical of their story, he went to investigate it for himself, bringing with him several men from the town armed with rope nooses to capture the beast. Using a lamb as bait, they lured the dragon from its lair and were able to subdue it before suffocating it to death with smoke. The dragon was then skinned, stuffed, and hung in the town square.\n\r\nIn thanks to Lord Albrecht, the new city was supposedly named in his honor (Trautenau), and was later adapted into Czech as 'Trutnov'. Legend also has it that the stuffed dragon was gifted to Brno, and continues to hang in its city hall.\n\r\nEvery year in the first weekend of May, the residents of Trutnov commemorate the slaying of the dragon in a ceremony called Už ho nesou (\"They are already carrying him\"), in which a tin dragon is symbolically hoisted up onto the facade of the city hall in the main square, where it remains until September or October. The ceremony itself is accompanied by a large public festival with food, drinks, and medieval costumes. Outsiders are rare, but are more than welcome.",

          "description": "In the 1950s, the site now known as Riker Hill Art Park was used as a United States Army Nike Missile Tracking Base. Its location, the highest elevation in the county, offered the perfect clear line defense against anyone attempting to target the New York Metro area.\n\r\nBy the 1970s, due to advancements in weapons systems, these measures became obsolete, and in 1974, the base, known as Riker Hill Nike Battery Control Area NY-80, was sold to the county for $1. For a short time, the site was used to showcase dinosaur fossils that had been found nearby, in a quarry. But there was little interest from the public, and this was also closed down.\n\r\nShortly after, the former army barracks were transformed into 38 artist studios, with the spaces now being used for various disciplines, such as sculpture, painting, photography, glass blowing, pottery, printmaking, ceramics, and more.\n\r\nEach of the buildings is painted a different color. Whilst taking a stroll around the 42-acre complex you can enjoy the scenic overlooks, check out the large metal sculptures, and also see if you can spot any military remnants.",

Up on the green slopes, there is also a historic monument dating back to the Middle Ages: the Hunger Wall of Prague.\n\r\nBuilt by the order of Charles IV, the first King of Bohemia to become the Holy Roman Emperor, the defensive wall was completed in 1362, built out of marlstone quarried from Petřín Hill. Originally up to 4.5 meters (14 feet) tall, the wall is believed to have been constructed to strengthen Prague Castle's defenses. It has been renovated multiple times throughout history, particularly in 1624 and recently in 1975.\n\r\nAs suggested by its evocative name, the wall comes with a story. It was originally referred to as Zubatá (\"toothed\") after its bastioned appearance, but soon people started calling it Chlebová (\"for bread\") or Hladová (\"hungry\") following the famine in 1361. The construction provided a great deal of labor for the people of Prague, giving them a job and, thus, bread to live on.\n\r\nAccording to local folklore, this was the very purpose of the wall's construction in the first place, rather than the city's defense. Later historians, in the 15th and 16th centuries, also claimed that King Charles IV himself visited the construction site every day and even worked with his people, whom he called his dear family, for several hours a day.",

          "description": "Alongside an old Roman and Celtic road in Luxembourg stands a marker honoring a mysterious figure known as \"the Dead Woman.\" Also known as Doudeg Fra or La Femme Morte, the origins of this marker aren't entirely clear.\n\r\nOne theory is that the site was a location for an ancient sanctuary dedicated to the Roman goddess Diana or to the Alma Mater, a religious symbol of fertility.\n\r\nAnother interpretation of the “Dead Woman” is that it represents Elisabeth of Görlitz (1391–1451). In 1388, King Wencelaus pledged the territory of Luxembourg for his debts against his cousin Jobst of Moravia. After his death in 1409, his widow Elisabeth of Görlitz had been the only Pawnee of Luxembourg. To pay off the debts of her deceased husband, Elisabeth had to sell Luxembourg to the Duke Philippe of Burgundy in 1441.\n\r\nAccording to ancient records from the Heiliggeist Monastery, the sale took place at the exact location of the Dead Woman monument using a traditional sales ritual called \"hand hitting,\" where the seller holds a branch and a handful of soil in their hand and a buyer must hit the seller’s hand until they drop the branch and soil. Legend says that immediately after the sale was completed, Elisabeth of Görlitz said “Now I am a dead woman.” It's unclear what Elisabeth meant by this and whether her use of the word \"dead\" should be understood to mean she was “done,” “ineffectual,” or “worthless.” According to tradition, it's custom to leave offerings of branches at this location and place them with the words “This is for the dead woman.”\n\r\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, Doudeg Fra was marked by a crucifix perched on several stone blocks. However, in 1982 this was replaced by the current marker, which features a carved crucifix scene.",

After initial designs in the 1990s, it appeared in Belgrade in the early 2000s.\n\r\nKnown as \"the building with sails\", the YUBC, known earlier as the NBG Centar, had once been considered one of the most luxurious residential buildings for social housing. Designed by the Serbian architect Mario Jobst with GP Energoprojekt as the investor and contractor, the settlement was built in a supposedly Mediterranean style and served as an artistic expression of the architect who is known to emphasize red in his constructions. Having been inspired by the Danube as well as the sails of ships, Jobst sought to display ornamentation in a part of the city predominantly defined by grey Brutalism.  \n\r\nOn the ground, it is unmissable to the foreign eye. Being quite a big complex, you will be able to observe a plethora of \"futuristic\" glass, concrete, red, and green elements.",

These sinkholes come in several shapes and sizes, and their importance was recognized by the indigenous Maya peoples, not only as freshwater sources but also for their belief systems. A certain cenote has even gained the name of \"Pet Cemetery\" due to the large number of animal bones found at its bottom. Many other cenotes are known for their wealth of religious offerings such as jewelry.\n\r\nZiiz Ha (\"cold waterwell\" in Yucatec Mayan) currently stands on the grounds of the Catholic convent of San Bernardino de Siena, built in the mid-16th century, and is covered by a colonial stone structure that appears to be a well. Even with this construction, which obstructs access to the cenote's waters even more than the natural cave above it already did, Ziiz Ha has been explored by diving archaeologists for decades.\n\r\nRather than pre-Columbian jewelry or prehistoric animal bones, what they have found here dates to the Colonial era that defines its architectural surroundings. Weapons, most of them artillery, dating from the 18th and 19th centuries were a bulk of the findings. The origins of these firearms, cannonballs, and similar objects represent the Colonial history of the region, as they include not only Spanish examples but also several British ones. This is due to the production of weapons in the British Empire, as well as their arming of troops and civilians in colonies.\n\r\nThe weapons were discarded either to keep them away from enemy hands or just to get rid of them. The huge haul of colonial war artifacts found in the cenote represents an important archaeological heritage.",

Then comes the familiar golden glow Berliners have lived by for nearly two centuries.\n\r\nBut these scenes are fading fast in the city home to more than half the world’s working gas streetlamps. Since 2011, the German city has been working on converting them to LED alternatives—a process brought back into sharp focus by climate change and Russia’s war against Ukraine—leaving conservationists feeling that Berlin is losing something with…",

It runs along the eastern side of the Cascades and is a major north-south route that has become more important with the burgeoning development in eastern Oregon and Washington. Indeed, it has become an alternate trucking route to Interstate-5. Traditionally called The Dalles-California highway in Oregon, it goes directly through Bend, now the largest population center in Oregon east of the Cascades.\n\r\nAbout 2.5 miles north of Terrebonne, Oregon US-97 crosses the Crooked River on a high bridge over the Crooked River Gorge. The current span, the Rex T. Barber Veteran Memorial Bridge, was completed in 2000. It is a concrete arch with a span of 410 feet (125 meters) some 300 feet (91 meters) above the river, which places it 22nd in height among U.S. bridges. It replaced the Crooked River High Bridge, which had become inadequate with the increasing traffic on the highway. The High Bridge was built in 1926 and consists of a steel arch with a main span 330 feet (100 meters) long. About 350 feet downstream of the current bridge, it has been preserved for foot traffic, and is the second-highest span to be converted to pedestrian use after Navajo Bridge in Arizona.\n\r\nA railroad bridge crosses the gorge about 850 feet downstream of the High Bridge. Built in 1911, it consists of a two-hinge arch with a span of 460 feet (140 meters). Both highway bridges mimicked the arch design of the original railroad bridge for aesthetic reasons. This bridge, now part of the BNSF Railway system, is still in use.",

Like a 19th-century graffiti, local legend has it that the \"M\"—that stands out on a straight road that could have continued straight towards the mountain—was created by an Austro-Hungarian engineer Josip Slade-Šilović who was in love with a Montenegrin princess called Milena.\n\r\nTasked with designing a modern road for cars from Kotor to Cetinje following the Berlin Congress in 1878, this designer from Trogir was later a palace builder and created a rut in the road with an \"M\" symbol. Montenegrin writer Jovan J. Martinović has since passed on the joke of the people of Cetinje, which was created at the expense of this letter M: \"And imagine if he accidentally fell in love with Princess Olga—the road wouldn't end without the song of gusles (a Montenegrin fiddle)!\"\n\r\nAustro-Hungarian influence can be seen all over Montenegro. Generally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire improved the Montenegrin infrastructure greatly as compared to the Ottoman Empire which is largely revered and documented by song and poem in how much sorrow it caused to the entire region. A lot of Montenegro's oldest and sturdiest roads were built by Austro-Hungarian engineers, such as this one by the secret crush of Milena, which has been preserved almost entirely in its original form.",

Leave comfort behind, depart on a physical journey, and find peace away from the big city. There are many of these little chapels located worldwide. However, the Schönstatt Catholic movement originated in Germany. \n\r\nThe chapel sits sensitively in the beautiful and quiet landscape. The scenery is idyllic, the brisk winds are reassuring, and the valley beyond creates an atmosphere of tranquillity. Despite the chapel’s unassuming size, it certainly has a way of drawing visitors in closer. When you first catch a glimpse of the structure, the stained glass windows glisten in the sun like gemstones, and the crowning bell perched atop the pitched roof adds a quiet touch of dignity. \n\r\nIt’s almost as if this humble yet charming little church takes on a personality of its own, beckoning visitors closer, whispering, “Look at me, look at me.”\n\r\nInside the chapel, sheltered from the elements, the structure cocoons you. The walls are washed with sunlight entering thru the windows, creating a symphony of color. Along the central aisle, the rows of pews at either side lead you toward the altar. There, directly ahead of you, an image of the Virgin Mary is enshrined, beautifully constructed in an ornate dark wood, aka el Santuario de Schönstatt. The daylight streams down upon the shrine of Mary and intensifies the atmosphere of peace and stillness.\n\r\nMary’s Road to Heaven, aka María, Camino al Cielo, is a pilgrimage dedicated to the Virgin Mary that is open to everyone. It’s a journey that leaves the everyday behind. An upward climb of 1,200 feet. A trail of discovery in the quiet of the mountains. And a pathway to peace away from the bustling city.",

So much so that she became one of America's first Black female millionaires, along with Madam C.J. Walker.\n\r\nIn addition to hiring formerly enslaved people to work in her many enterprises, Pleasant also donated large sums of money to support the Underground Railroad. This was a vast network of people who would offer aid and shelter to enslaved people. She also campaigned for the end of slavery in the state of California and fought to desegregate the city's street cars.\n\r\nThe city of San Francisco designated the six trees Pleasant planted herself, along with the plaque, as a Structure of Merit in 1974. The area of Octavia and Bush Streets is in the vicinity of where the \"Mother of Civil Rights in California\" once owned a mansion. It's common for ghost tours to start at the small park, where some say that Pleasant's spirit remains among the trees.",

It was the collegiate church of Saints Cassius and Florentius, third-century Roman legionaries of the legendary all-Christian Theban Legion.\n\r\nAccording to the legend, the Legion's garrison was ordered by Roman Emperor Maxentius Herculius to march to Gaul. While on their way, the Emperor either ordered the Legion to massacre fellow Christians or worship him as a god. The soldiers refused, resulting in their martyrdom. Cassius and Florentius were beheaded on the site where Bonn Minster stands today.\n\r\nIn 2002, German-Turkish sculptor Iskender Yediler created a pair of giant granite sculptures, replicating the heads of the two saints portrayed at the church. They have been placed in front of Bonn Minster, lying mid-roll in a somewhat surreal manner.\n\r\nInside the church, a pair of 18th-century hardwood busts depicting Cassius and Florentius were discovered in its storehouse in 2006. Restored, they are put on display during the festive times in October above the entrance to the crypt.",

Before the modern planting, the site held Australia’s first zoo which operated from 1862-1883. The zoo was started by the NSW acclimatization society, an organization whose objective was to introduce exotic flora and fauna to Australia. Its first residents included an anteater and Chinese deer. In 1883, the zoo was relocated to Moore Park south of the gardens.\n\r\nIn 1936, the first iteration of the cacti and succulent rockery was built and a larger garden was completed in 1983. The rockery also features a rustic sculpture garden by Jamie Durie which was added in 2007.",

Situated on the Eyre Peninsula, the lake sits on the Nullarbor Plain, a large arid desert that is one of the country's most unique landscapes. Visitors to Lake Macdonnell have to drive along a dirt track before being rewarded with magnificent views of the water.\n\r\nWhen the conditions are right, the lake appears salmon pink in color and the high salt concentration gives a unique reflection effect. This special coloring is caused by dunaliella salina, an algae species that thrives in hypersaline conditions, and halobacteria that secrete a red pigment called carotenoid.\n\r\nThe lake also has an interesting industrial history and for many years was a booming salt mine. Gypsum, a soft sulfate mineral, has also been mined at the site since 1919, and this location is Australia's largest mine of this type and is thought to be one of the largest gypsum deposits in the southern hemisphere.",

          "description": "Few airlines capture the romance of air travel's golden age more than Pan American World Airways, commonly known as Pan Am. Founded by Juan T. Trippe in 1927 and originally connecting the U.S. with Latin America, Pan Am grew to serve a worldwide network of destinations, first with large flying boats and later with jets.\n\r\nIn the late 1960s, Pan Am worked closely with Boeing on the design of the 747, the original Jumbo Jet and one of the world's most recognizable aircraft. but after Trippe's retirement in 1968, Pan Am began to fall on hard times. The oil crisis of the 1970s lowered demand for travel, and airline deregulation brought increased competition. Pan Am sold off most of its assets before finally declaring bankruptcy and ceasing operations in December 1991. \n\r\nWhile Pan Am airplanes no longer crisscross the skies, its iconic brand and legacy live on. Movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Catch Me If You Can prominently feature the airline. The airline also lives on in subtler ways: the reason why the pilot in command of an airliner is referred to as \"captain,\" for example, traces its roots to Pan Am and its magnificent flying boats. \n\r\nThe third floor of the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Garden City, Long Island, is known as Pan Am Museum, operated by the Pan Am Museum Foundation. It tells the story of the airline's 64-year history with original artifacts and scale models, as well as artwork. Those who never got the chance to fly aboard a Pan Am Clipper can be transported back in time to the heart of the jet age at the Pan Am Museum.",

          "description": "Originally named Wat Kok Khwai, the Buddhist temple now known as Wat Yannawa or the “Boat Temple” was built during the Ayutthaya era, before the founding of Bangkok. It was merely a local place of worship until King Rama I granted it royal status and made the ordination hall known as subosot in Thai.\n\r\nDuring the reign of Rama III (1824-1851), a defining feature was added to the temple complex: a viharn (monastery) in the shape of a Chinese junk. At the time, the junk ship was becoming obsolete and starting to be replaced by newer, more modern vessels. It is believed that King Rama III wished to preserve the image of the Chinese junk in the mind of his people.\n\r\nThanks to this unique feature, it was not long before the locals started to coin its nickname, Wat Yannawa (literally “boat temple”), which would stick and become its official name. With the two chedis designed to resemble masts, it also gained the nickname Sampao Chedi, the “Chinese junk with chedis,” as it looked more like a ship than a temple.\n\r\nToday, besides the junk-shaped viharn, the temple complex contains multiple buildings enshrining images and a relic of the Buddha, effigies of Kuan Im, the goddess of mercy, and large paintings of the Loy Krathong lantern festival. In front of the “boat” stands a bronze statue of Rama III, looking proud that his image of the Chinese junk has lived on beyond his life.",

While legends persist, the establishment’s age is undeniable. St. Peter Stiftskulinarium, mentioned in documents dating back to 803, claims to be the oldest known operating restaurant in Europe.\n\r\nThe restaurant’s grandeur extends across 11 dining rooms, each with its own elaborate design and tapestry of captivating anecdotes. From the opulent Baroque Hall to the intimate “citizens’ room” Prälatenstube, the establishment is certainly a feast for the eyes. With an 850-person capacity, it also offers ample opportunity for people-watching.\n\r\nThe Stiftskulinarium’s kitchen prides itself on serving upscale regional specialties, including the Viennese classic tafelspitz (slow-simmered beef in broth and vegetables) and Salzburger Nockerl a sweet dessert soufflé made with egg yolk, flour, sugar and vanilla. With changing seasons, the menu embraces diverse local flavors, showcasing fresh fish, game dishes, and often imaginative influences from Mediterranean cuisine.\n\r\nAs twilight descends, the restaurant’s renowned Mozart Dinner Concert takes place. Every night, the Baroque Hall’s high stuccoed ceilings are illuminated by candlelight across white gala tables. In collaboration with the Salzburg Concert Society, the dining experience features a three-course menu of authentic 17th- and 18th-century recipes accompanied by live musical performances featuring the work of Salzsburg’s most famous native, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Performers and stewards in fanciful period attire add to the time-warp flair.",

The University of Michigan botanist, Elzada Clover, intended to make the first-ever botanical survey of the river and its environs.

Regis College in Weston, Massachusettes has one located on the southern edge of its campus. However, this location is quite distinctive as it's one of the few museums in the United States dedicated to the study and collecting of postage stamps, also known as Philately.\n\r\nFounded in 1961, the Spellman Museum of Stamps & Postal History, or the Cardinal Spellman Philatelic Museum is the oldest museum of its kind in the United States. It is also the second largest collection of philatelic material after the National Postal Museum operated by the Smithsonian. Its founder was Cardinal Francis Spellman, who served as the sixth Archbishop of New York from 1939 to 1967 and previously as the auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston from 1932 to 1939. He was also an avid philatelic.\n\r\nToday, the museum contains over two million items including Spellman's personal collection, pieces from the former National Philatelic Museum in Philadelphia as well as donations from the general public.\n\r\nIts principal mission is to preserve and promote knowledge of history, geography, art, culture, architecture, science, and nature through the story of stamps and postage.",

It was also used as a guest house, offering a 180-degree view from Torrey Pines State Park to La Jolla.\n\r\nThe house is currently abandoned, and its cliffside tram hasn't run in years.

          "description": "You know the feeling. The door opens onto a white expanse. The light is overwhelming; you can feel it in your head and instinctively raise a hand to cover your eyes. Then the white fades out to the edges. You might see green on the trees, or the blue of water, or the gray of a motel parking lot. It’s summer. There’s a breeze. And you have a whole day and night ahead of you.\n\r\nThis is how we at Atlas Obscura think of the beginning of summer—blinding, then full of opportunity and the potential for adventure. To celebrate that feeling and the potential it carries, this year we’re presenting our first-ever season-long special section: Summer of Wonder.\n\r\nFor the next three months, we’re going to be exploring three themes that capture some of the magic of being outside in the summertime:\n\r\n\r\nOn the Road: Road tripping and roadside attractions, modern and historical\n\r\nSummer Nights: Starry skies, fireflies, and nostalgia\n\r\nGo Wild: Encounters with the natural world (with a preview of one of Atlas Obscura’s big new projects)\n\r\n\r\nSummer of Wonder will include stories that explore overlooked corners of history, food, and the natural world, as well as recommendations that can help you make the most of your escapades—from itineraries and roadside geology, to stargazing and recognizing some of the creatures you might meet (or dream of) along the way.\n\r\nCharge your battery or fill up your tank. We’ve got miles ahead of us.",

          "description": "This site was once a secret private property that was kept a close secret by locals. It was a place to sneak away to with friends in spring to play in the flowers until the early 2000s. The property is now called Parson Reserve and is a part of the DNRT Trust. The first daffodils were planted on the property during World War II and now there are thousands of them throughout the woods.\n\r\nThe trails are open year-round but the best time to see the flowers is in the spring (April). The daffodil field is up a steep wooded trail and hidden from view of the road. The trails DNRT keeps up the trails and they are lightly marked so it's easy to find the way. People aren't allowed to walk or pick the flowers anymore, but there are narrow walking paths through them.",

So they made it their mission to seek out what lay beyond these limited search results. And what they found was a world brimming with everything from Pakistani hot chicken and Uzbek dumplings to Turkish flatbreads and roast brisket on rye.\n\r\n“There's this multiculturalism of different kinds of restaurants and people just wanting to try other people's food,” says Azad, one-third of the team of food bloggers known collectively as Muslim Foodies.

It was Gibeau Orange Julep, a towering dome run by a family that’s slung their orange juleps—a creamier take on squeezed citrus, thanks to the addition of powdered egg—since the 1930s.\n\r\n\"Most people spend, like, a year planning that,\" he laughs. \"I just go.\"\nThis is a typical weekend for Pujol, who spends his free time traveling the country and chronicling the history of roadside Americana (\"well, Canadiana\" in the case of the giant orange, he points out) for his online alter-ego, The Retrologist.

In 1903, Horatio Jackson and Sewall Crocker became the first people ever to drive a car from one side of the United States all the way to the other.\n\r\nCars were an exciting novelty at the time, and their numbers were exploding—from 8,000 in 1900 to 32,920 in 1903—but many still considered the “horseless carriage” a passing fad. There were few suitable roads, let alone a nationwide road network. So theirs was an adventure like none before. And it all started with a $50 bet.\n\r\nThis map is from the 1907 edition of the Automobile Association of America’s Blue Book. It shows the routes of all the cross-country car trips completed until then: no more than 11 in total—and strangely, all duos. (The Jackson-Crocker trip is …",

Despite their headless state, these victims are easy to identify. They are Narceus americanus, the American giant millipede.

          "description": "My last post said that the low ratings of current economic conditions weren't the result of increased partisanship--it's not just Republicans who rate them as poor, but people of all parties.  Of course, \"economic conditions\" can cover a lot of things, so let's look at some of the alternative measures.  Gallup has a question going back to 2001:  \"Thinking about the job situation in America today, would you say that it is now a good time or a bad time to find a quality job?\"  The last time it was asked (January 2023), 64% said it was a good time and 33% said it was a bad time.  That's good by historical standards--higher than it ever was before August 2017.  So people are quite positive about one important aspect of the economy.  Gallup also has this question:  \"Next, we are interested in h…",

          "description": "The news that Arif Ahmed is to be appointed the UK’s first ‘Free Speech Tsar’ — a position that apparently comes with “the power to investigate universities and student unions in England and Wales that wrongly restrict debate” and to “advise the sector regulator on imposing fines for free speech breaches” — is disappointing for various reasons. One of them (not the most important one) is that it suggests Britain’s capacity to name things continues to decline. To see this once-great country reach for a foreign title that not only originates with one second-rate empire trying to recall the glory of the Romans but that was first popularized as a job-title within the administrative apparatus of another is really quite sad, given that England has so many equally preposterous but largely home-grown (or at least Norman French) titles available right on its own doorstep. It’s a scandal, really. A kind of Tsargate, if you will.\nHere I present a few alternatives of my own, along with some excellent suggestions from others following up with me about this on social media. As an alternative to “Free Speech Tsar”, consider one or more of the following: The Duke of Discourse. Warden of All Chit-Chat. Equerry of Arguments. Gold Stick To The Point. The Earl of Axiom. The Keeper of the King’s Premises. The Wheedle Beadle. Chief Constable Counterexample. The Postillion of Positing. The Justiciar of Just One More Thing. The Marquess of My Question is More of a Comment. The Archbishop of Banterbury. The Lord Privy Sealion. Groom of the Discourse. Chancellor of the Factchequer. Red Herring Pursuivant. Master of the Eyerolls.\nAs should be clear, the capacity exists within the UK to develop an entire peerage system of Free Speech aristocrats of all ranks. I strongly encourage Rishi Sunak to implement just such a scheme as soon as is practicable.",

While we saw immense progress toward discovering the basic laws governing matter, space, and time, this has slowed to a crawl since 1980, despite an immense amount of work.

          "description": "I like the graphical lay out of Jordan-Holder. I've drawn pictures like this, but I hadn't worked out the axiomatization of all possible pictures, which is really clarifying. It's also good preparation for Schubert calculus: If you consider the case where your ground ring is a field, this is the recipe to assign a permutation to a pair of complete flags.\r\n\r\nCould I make a notational suggestion? You call your modules M_i, M'_j and M_{i,j}. If you called them X_i, Y_j and Z_{i,j}, not only would they be more visually distinctive, but you could make it mnemonic -- X_i on the x-axis and Y_j on the y-axis. This would be particularly nice because you use the variables i, i', j and j' later, and it surprised me that i and i' went with M while j and j' go with M'.",

My position (contrary to others) is that this is  because there are two dominant kinds of supernovae! It is because the disk mixes gas quickly in the azimuthal direction, such that a star's properties are mainly set by the (cosmic) time at which it was born, and the radius at which it was born. If I'm right, then you can't really use disk stars to understand process yields, since they are always an ugly mixture of processes. If I am wrong, there's lots more to do!realAPOGEEnot",

Various take-homes include that we need to mitigate lots of stellar noise, and that we care deeply about the covariance (as a function of separation in time) of adjacent measurements. I advocated that we split our ten-year survey into two or three surveys, of varying length. In the first, we learn about the stars, and in the last, we go to town on the very most promising targets. There was general agreement that this is a good idea. But now we need a very specific plan for what this means. As my loyal reader knows, in my view, the decisions must be based on repeatable operations, so that we have some hope of learning statistical things about populations in the end.",

          "description": "The goal of this post is to present a simple formula for fairly pricing options, called the binomial options pricing model (Cox et al., 1979; Rendleman, 1979). This is sometimes called the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model (CRR) after the authors’ surnames in (Cox et al., 1979). I like this model because it is a simple, discrete-time model that captures much of the intuition behind how to price options, while avoiding much of the mathematical machinery needed for a continuous-time treatment or Black–Scholes (Black &amp; Scholes, 1973). Learning the binomial model is like climbing a smaller, easier mountain that gives views that are almost as good as its larger, more intimidating neighbor. As we will see, despite its simplicity this model introduces many important concepts from the options-pricing literature such as the no-arbitrage condition, pricing via replication, and the risk-neutral measure. And it does so without any advanced mathematics.",
