          "description": "The ancient ruins of Orikum, at the south end of the Bay of Vlorë in Albania, is an important historical landmark boasting a rich history, well-preserved ruins, and a unique blend of Illyrian, Greek and Roman influences. \n\r\nFounded by Euboeans and originally situated on an island, Orikum was well-positioned for communication with Corfu and Greece. The city was only 40 miles across the sea from Otranto, making it a convenient stopover between Greece and Italy. Ancient sources described it as a harbor, but it eventually attained the status of a polis and issued its own coins from around 230 to 168 B.C.\n\r\nOrikum's military importance continued under Roman rule, as it served as a base during Rome's wars with the Illyrians and Macedonia, which occupied it for a time. Julius Caesar captured the city during the civil war in 48 B.C.\nUnder Ottoman rule, the city was renamed Orikum Pashaliman, \"the Pasha's harbor,\" and the lagoon and nearby Albanian navy base still bears this name today.\n\r\nThe city's past is not only marked by ancient history; in 1950, Pashaliman was the only Soviet base in the Mediterranean. The base became a hot spot of conflict between the Russians and Albanians in 1961. The base is still in operation today, hosting a small fleet of ships.\nVisitors to Orikum can marvel at the ancient ruins, which, although not as extensive or well-preserved as other sites, are impressive nonetheless. The picturesque surroundings of the Bay of Vlorë and the verdant hillsides create a stunning backdrop, adding to the allure of this historical landmark.",

But like most kids growing up in suburbia, my first exposure to iceberg lettuce involved a few wan hothouse tomatoes and a bottle of dressing with Paul Newman’s face on it.\nBy the time I was learning to cook as a teen, wedge salads and iceberg were hopelessly passé. I aspired to the salads spotted in the dog-eared pages of old Gourmets—turrets of microgreens and edible flowers à la Alice Waters, who famously snubbed iceberg—made in far-off places like San Francisco.\n\r\nI've since seen the error of my snobby ways, and I’m not alone.

          "description": "The City of Gas got its unique name from the natural gas deposits found in what was then known as Elm Township. The cheap fuel boom caused a local farmer, E.K. Taylor, to divide his farm into lots in 1898, leading to the creation of “Gas City.” The plentiful natural gas caused the town to reach a population of over 1,200 residents at its peak in 1910, however, by 1920, 70 percent of the population had left.\n\r\nGas remains on the map, with a current population of 475 residents, as measured by the 2020 census. In the 1970s, the local water tower was built, and the city council wanted to celebrate it with something fun and eye-catching. The tower was painted red to resemble a gas can, and the words “GAS KAN” were written across it, creating a play on words, and thus, the World’s Largest Gas Kan was born.\n\r\nThe water tower continues to serve the community, holding 100,000 gallons of water. The tower isn’t immediately visible from Highway 54, so it requires a brief, but intentional drive into town. However, a miniature replica of the Gas Kan is visible in the southwest corner of Fees Park, located at 2000th Street and West 1st Street.",

          "description": "In early Japanese archaeology and history, the Yayoi period is one of the major time periods that is believed to have lasted from the 10th century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. Bridging the prehistoric Jōmon period and the pre-dynastic Kofun period, it saw the proto-Japanese people's shift from a hunter-gatherer society to an agricultural civilization, which led to the dawn of the Iron Age in Japan.\n\r\nThe historical period is named after the Yayoi district in today's Bunkyo City, then called Mukaigaoka-Yayoi, where a number of terracotta vessels were unearthed in 1884. As research advanced, archaeologists concluded that the Yayoi-type pottery was a successor to the Jōmon pottery and of a separate period.

          "description": "The Grave of the Godstone Pirate can be found in an otherwise innocuous-looking church in Godstone.\n\r\nJohn Edward Trenchman was born in London in the 17th century. At the age of 12, he left the city's docks and joined the crew of the notorious pirate Henry Morgan. After years at sea, Trenchman returned to England but did not leave his pirate ways behind. He smuggled goods along the country's southeast coast. But when a member of his crew was arrested and gave up the secret smuggling routes, customs officers put a stop to his piracy. \n\r\nTrenchman was wounded in the ambush. He escaped and made his way to the Fox and Hounds Inn in Godstone, but eventually succumbed to his wounds and died at the pub. Villagers buried him in an unmarked grave at the south end of the churchyard at St. Nicholas.\n\r\nThe church was the subject of several episodes of haunting after the pirate was initially buried in an unmarked grave at the back of the church until the priest and churchwardens removed the pirate’s body and reburied him with a full Christian service, opposite the church doors. From then on nothing more was seen or heard of Godstone’s pirate ghost.\n\r\nMore can be found about the pirate at the Fox and Hounds pub, where he died. The pub is a few minutes' drive from the church on the other side of Godstone. It can be found by heading into Godstone from the church and heading towards Godstone Farm (follow the signs). The pub is a little way past the Godstone Farm.",

          "description": "This incredible canyon features the Popo Agie River (pronounced \"puh-POE-zha\"), which descends through the canyon in gentle cascades. What's particularly unique about The Sinks is that the river disappears underground for about a quarter-mile, then reemerges further downstream.\n\r\nIt takes several hours for the water to reappear on the surface, though this same volume of water, traveling aboveground, would only take a few minutes. For years, geologists were stumped about how the river could take so long to travel such a short distance. While they still cannot confirm the passage, the theory is that there are a myriad of winding passages for the water to work through, drastically lengthening its travel time. Cracks, fissures, dead ends, and side traps create a world of obstacles for the water to overcome before reemerging and continuing its path down the canyon.\n\r\nTake a night to camp in the park's beautiful campground that rests right on the river and be sure to keep an eye on the cliffs nearby when it is dark. If you spotlights bobbing along the cliff's face, it's merely local mountaineers out for a night climb.",

          "description": "Since antiquity, frogs have been a lucky symbol in Japanese culture. For one thing, they are associated with the rain—needed to grow rice—and are considered a messenger of several deities. Additionally, the Japanese word for \"frog\" is homophonous with the word meaning \"to return:\" kaeru. Thanks to this wordplay, frogs are believed to grant safety to travelers until they return home and bring back health and money that one has spent.\n\r\nAt Hakata Station, one of the major transport hubs in Fukuoka, there is a small golden frog hiding in plain sight, and it is said that good luck will come to whoever finds it.\n\r\nDesigned by sculptor Satoshi Yabuuchi, widely known as the creator of Nara Prefecture's mascot character Sento-Kun, the Golden Frog was humbly unveiled when the JR Hakata City station mall was completed in 2011. It has since been climbing the wall of the building, unnoticed by most passengers. The idea behind its conception was that one should walk with their head up, or they would miss nice things in life.",

          "description": "This rural museum and water utility office honors the life of the town of Piqua’s most famous non-resident, Buster Keaton. Despite his limited relationship with the town during his lifetime, Piqua has become the truest home of the comic genius of the silent screen.\n\r\nKeaton was born October 4, 1895, in Piqua, Kansas, but he never lived there. His parents, a moderately famous vaudevillian couple who performed together as “The Two Keatons,” had no connection to Piqua. However, they were in town supporting Harry Houdini’s act on the day Buster was born. Buster would grow up on the road, first performing onstage with his parents before making the jump to film. \n\r\nKeaton starred in some of the greatest comedies of the era, many of which he directed himself, revolutionizing the language of comedy filmmaking. He weathered career setbacks including the switch to sound and personal struggles, and lived to see interest in his work and career revived in the 1950s.\n\r\nThe famed actor visited Piqua only once in his lifetime. In 1957, Keaton and his wife, Eleanor, were driving back from the Kansas State Fair, when Eleanor saw a sign for Piqua. According to Eleanor, In shock, she stopped short, waking Buster, who was surprised to discover that his hometown even existed. In a hurry, they briefly walked through town, and pledged to come back one day.\n\r\nWhile Keaton never returned before passing away in 1966, Eleanor would come back frequently, as Piqua and the nearby town of Iola began planning an annual festival to honor their native son. People, including Eleanor, began donating memorabilia to the festival, which was held annually from 1993 until 2023. Without the level of attendance needed to build a permanent museum, Piqua opened up the Buster Keaton Museum as a room within the water department, where it still stands today.",

          "description": "Among our crosswords and other puzzles, we're featuring logic challenges from Puzzle Communication Nikoli, a cult-favorite puzzle publication from Japan. A PDF of the puzzle, as well as the solution, can be downloaded below.\n\r\n\r\nMany of the challenges in Puzzle Communication Nikoli, Japan’s influential publication of logic puzzles, have been around for a while. But readers and puzzle enthusiasts are always submitting new ideas. Some get published, and among those some pick up enough fans that they earn a place in the regular puzzle lineup. Double Choco is the most recent addition to that lineup that we’ve featured in Atlas Obscura. It was created in 2018 by a reader with the pseudonym Airplane, who was a new Nikoli reader at the time.\n\r\n\r\nAirplane was interested in grid puzzles that involve shapes and resolve to recognizable images, according to Nikoli president and puzzle creator Yoshinao Anpuku. He was also inspired by fractal art, or art involving geometric structures that repeat at small and large sizes. The resulting puzzle, Double Choco, isn’t quite fractal art, but the idea of repeated, connected shapes and patterns runs through it.\n\r\nAirplane named the puzzle Double Chocolate, which was shortened slightly by the editors, in reference to dark and white chocolate. The two-color arrangement distinguishes puzzle grids from others in Nikoli’s pages, and often creates pleasing symmetries (as seen in Puzzle #3 below).\n\r\n\r\nSolving a Double Choco involves reasoning at several levels. The goal is to divide the grid into blocks by drawing solid lines over the dotted lines. Each block must contain an equal number of white and gray cells, and those areas of white and gray must have the same form/shape. They can be rotated or mirrored to match one another. The numbers in the grid indicate the number of cells of that color in its block—or half the total cells in the block. A block can contain any number of cells with the number, or no number at all.\n\r\n\r\nStumped? Download the solutions!",

And if you’re at all interested in planes, military history, or the history of Myrtle Beach, it’s a must-see on any trip to the beach. \n\r\nAvailable to view here are three former Air Force planes: an A-7D Corsair, an A-10 Warthog, and an F-100 Super Sabre. All three are on “static display”, meaning you unfortunately can’t watch them get airborne, but you can walk around them in all their glory, admiring every wing and panel from close proximity. All three were fighter aircraft used by the Air Force when it had a base here, which closed in 1993. The park also includes a Wall of Service, which lists the names of military and civilian personnel who were stationed at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base until it closed in 1993. \n\r\nWhile you can’t watch these jets in action, Warbird park is an excellent place to watch commercial planes take off at the nearby airport once you’ve snapped a few photos of the Warthog (a type of jet flown since 1976) and the Super Sabre (designed in the 1940s). While the park is small, it offers some shade in the form of trees, as well as picnic tables where you can enjoy lunch as you catch a few landings. There are also some walking paths leading from the park.",

Soon, one office pinball game turned into two, and eventually he had so many that he began taking them home. Eventually, Pinkas learned how to repair these mazes of moving parts, from their plungers (those spring-loaded knobs that send the balls flying) to their switches, spinners, and stoppers.

After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1957, Duke immediately became a 2nd Lieutenant in the Air Force and later earned a master’s in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT. In 1966 he applied to the Apollo program, and eventually became a part of NASA’s fifth group of astronauts. \n\r\nOn April 20, 1972, Charles Duke took his first steps on the moon as part of the Apollo 16 mission. He was only 36-years-old, making him the youngest moon walker on earth. It’s a record that he still holds. Less than a year later, Duke also became the first inductee into the newly established South Carolina Hall of Fame, leaving his own moon boot footprints in cement in front of the Myrtle Beach Convention Center. \n\r\n“Moonprints” are easily recognizable by their wide soles and straight, thick ribs, and Duke’s look much like they did 50 years ago, thanks to mild weather and that they’re a bit off the beaten path. Along with the prints, there’s a plaque just beneath them reads: “These are the footprints of Astronaut Colonel Charles M. Duke, Jr., a native of South Carolina, who walked on the moon April 20, 1972, and the first inductee to the South Carolina Hall of Fame at its dedication on February 14, 1973.” \n\r\nDuke was the 10th out of 12 men to walk on the moon during the Apollo program’s six missions (which took place between July 1969 and December 1972), and spent 71 hours on its surface as a lunar module pilot of Apollo 16. While there, he collected a record 210 pounds of lunar rock samplings. \n\r\nAnother fun fact: During that same mission, Duke left a photo of himself, his wife, and his two sons on the moon’s surface, and it’s still there today.",

          "description": "On the night of January 29, 1893, in what is now downtown Curitiba, a young woman named Maria da Conceição Bueno was brutally murdered by her possessive lover, Ignácio José Diniz, a low-ranking soldier. Diniz slashed Bueno’s throat and stabbed her several times. News of the shocking crime spread throughout the city.\n\r\nA cross was allegedly placed at the murder site. Soon after, legend has it that red roses sprung from the cross, nurtured by the blood of the murder’s victim. With this Maria Bueno’s reputation as a miracle worker was born. \n\r\nMaria Bueno didn’t become notorious until after her death. Little is known about her for a fact, but there is no shortage of narratives on who she was and how she lived. Most versions state that she worked as a laundress. By some accounts, she was a sex worker. By others, she was a formerly enslaved Black woman whose image has been whitened along the decades—depictions of her, including the life-size statue at her grave, usually show her as a white woman.\n\r\nTo her devotees, Bueno’s life story is not as important as the miracles she reputedly performs. Her grave is surrounded by a myriad of stone signs and metal plates brought by believers to thank the local martyr for her help in matters like getting a job or beating an illness. Flowers, ribbons, and figurines are among other tokens of devotion that can be found in the little chapel by the grave. \n\r\nFor many locals, Maria Bueno holds the status of a saint. She is often referred to as Santinha de Curitiba (Curitiba’s Little Saint, or Dear Saint). So far, the Catholic Church hasn’t acknowledged her as such. In any case, the cult of Bueno is not exclusive to Catholics. She is also popular with followers of other faiths, especially Spiritualism and Umbanda, an Afro-Brazilian religion. Regardless of religious affiliations, though, Maria Bueno lives on in the collective imagination of the city as one of its most intriguing figures.",

But an avid fan of Disney World may notice its similarity to PeopleMover, an attraction in Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland, which the Subway shares much of its mechanical technology with.\n\r\nThe Subway first opened in 1969 along with the airport, but was replaced by a new underground train system that utilizes the WEDWay system, developed by what was then known as WED Transportation Systems, a division within the Walt Disney Company responsible for the design and construction of the rides at Disney parks.

The assault began without a proper declaration of war—the Soviet Union seemingly hoped their invasion of Finland would be as easy as those in the nearby Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This was the start of the Winter War.\n\r\nAlthough the Soviet Union forces greatly outnumbered them, the Finns actually successfully managed to repel the Soviet Union forces and then retained most of its territory when the Moscow Peace Treaty was signed in 1940.\n\r\nThis sculpture stands in front of the army headquarters in Helsinki as a national memorial to the Winter War. It is the creation of Pekka Kauhanen, and has stood at Kasarmitori in Kaartinkaupunki since November 2017.  President Martti Ahtisaari unveiled the sculpture on the 78th anniversary of the Winter War.\nThe spherical base of the sculpture contains 105 photographs that highlight the events of the Winter War.  The visibility of the images, however, is not always what was initially imagined. Since the unveiling, it has been plagued by moisture, which condenses on the inside of the circular windows and impairs the visibility of the photographs inside.\n\r\nThe memorial is an expression of appreciation for the valuable input of veterans and everyone else who participated in the war efforts from the Finnish people. The memorial was designed to commemorate the more than 25,000 Finns who gave their lives for their country during the Winter War.",

          "description": "As of 2023, Iceland is one of the few countries that still allows whaling—the hunting of whales (mainly) for food or oil. Fin whales and minke whales are the prime targets, the former for export and the latter for domestic consumption. In Iceland, public opinion on this practice is divided. The juxtaposition of commercial vs environmental motivations is further complicated by at least two other factors. On the one hand, the whale-watching industry is thriving, which obviously benefits from protecting whales. However, on the other hand, many Icelanders make a living in the herring fishing industry, which is adversely affected by large numbers of whales.\n\r\nIf opinion is divided in Iceland, there is no shortage of international organizations advocating a wholesale ban on whaling. Among them is the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which in 1986 orchestrated the sabotage of the whaling station in Hvalfjörður and sank two whaling vessels in the process, Hvalur 6 RE-376 and Hvalur 7 RE-377. Built in 1946, these two twin vessels had been in the Icelandic whaling fleet since 1961. A few days after the sinking, these vessels were recovered and towed to shore in Hvalfjörður, where they still are to this day.\n\r\nHvalfjörður translates as “whale fjord.” Traditional folklore maintains that early settlers spotted a pod of whales in these waters and named the fjord after it. A rival explanation is that the name originates from the presence of a large whale station (or more) in the fjord. To this day, Hvalfjörður is home to the only active whale station in Iceland.\n\r\nThe vessels, commonly referred to as the Beached Whalers, are safely anchored to the shore—side by side, as if they were the mirror image of each other. They are connected to heating and electricity, but damages caused by salt water and years of exposure to the elements were never repaired. Needless to say, they never went whale hunting again. Climbing on board is forbidden.",

There have been a few structures built on the top, but they are mostly now in ruins.

Garlick was not well-liked by the townspeople, and soon after the accusation was made, the people would gather and speak of other evils potentially caused by the “witch.” \n\r\nElizabeth’s father, Lion Gardiner, who was the first settler of the town and respected by all, determined Goody would be tried in Connecticut.

          "description": "For years, the only way to try Maria Piedad Cano’s famed arepas was to roam along Roosevelt Avenue well after dark and hope for good fortune. Cano was a lawyer and a judge in her homeland of Colombia, but after she fled to the United States, she turned to wielding a mobile griddle. In 1993, The New York Press dubbed her the “Saintly Arepa Lady” and the name stuck. \n\r\nLike many of New York City’s street vendors, Cano lived a precarious existence for decades. From 1983 through 2021, the city enforced a strict cap on the number of street vendor permits, leaving vendors struggling to either dodge the police or pay as much as $20,000 for permits on the black market. Cano was finally able to set up a brick-and-mortar location in Elmhurst in 2014, only to be forced to move once again when a developer demolished her building to make way for apartments. \n\r\nAt long last, Cano was able to reopen in 2018, along with her son Alejandro Osorio, who runs the current iteration of the restaurant. Arepa Lady currently has three branches, but the Jackson Heights outpost feels closest to Cano’s roots. \n\r\nThe arepas are as good as ever, particularly when crowned with a tangle of carne desmechada, slow-braised beef, or fat slices of chorizo. Order an arepa de queso, a plump corn cake oozing cheese from the interior, of an arepa de choclo, which comes folded over fillings like a diner-style omelet. Although carnivorous toppings dominate the menu, don’t sleep on the vegetarian offering—the trifecta of black beans, avocado, and sticky sweet plantains showered with grated cheese is outstanding.",

The consistency is somewhere between a tomato soup and a curry gravy, with a pleasant, slow-building burn. It’s the perfect foil for the rich, slightly filling of goat meat—although these dumplings also come stuffed with paneer, potatoes, beef, and all manner of other fillings. \n\r\nWith large Tibetan and Nepalese communities, Jackson Heights is the place to go for all sorts of regional styles of momos. By the time sibling duo Yamuna Shrestha and Shree Shrestha opened up their small restaurant in the shadow of the 7 train, the neighborhood already had a wealth of excellent options. Yet the Shresthas, who hail from just west of Kathmandu, still made a name for themselves, scoring the winning spot multiple years in a row on the informal neighborhood Momo Crawl. \n\r\nWhile an order of jhol momo belongs on every table, there are plenty of other heavy-hitters on the menu of Nepalese specialties. Both the thali and the samay baji sets offer solo diners the chance to try a range of dishes, all accompanied by chutney and brightly acidic pickles. Order one or two sel roti, chewy, crushed-rice doughnuts meant for dunking in a tangy, fiery dipping sauce, for the table. Head to the back of the restaurant to refill your cup with warmly spiced masala chai from the insulated container.",

The low, beamed ceilings, dark wooden furniture and stone hearth fireplace are cozy and inviting. At the same time, you can almost sense the ghosts of patrons past seated next to you as you sip ale out of a metal cup.  \n\r\nLike so many pubs, The Lamb Inn offers the traditional Sunday roast of roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, roasted veggies, and potatoes. But, Sunday Roast at The Lamb Inn is next level. This particular rendition of the classic is next-level, with generous portions and a heap of cheesy cauliflower included.",

Like many great pirates, Jean Lafitte's exact origins are shrouded in mystery, but he is believed to be born either in France or one of its Caribbean colony Saint-Domingue (now called Haiti) and he had a spectacular reputation for drinking, womanizing, and debauchery.\n\r\nAn equal-opportunity spy and smuggler, Lafitte lent his skills in military endeavors from the War of 1812 to the Mexican War of Independence. At various points, he worked for the British, U.S., and Spanish armies. He supposedly died in 1823—an event many scholars later believed to be a ruse. \n\r\nIn fact, according to local researchers in Lincolnton, North Carolina, believe that the buccaneer staged his own death, changed his name to Lorenzo Ferrer, then enjoyed a quiet life free from the prying eyes of law enforcement until his actual death in 1875. He is believed to be resting peacefully in the cemetery at St. Luke’s Episcopal Church.",

The Dena’ina were the original inhabitants of this south-central part of Alaska, and the only coastal Athabascan tribe. \n\r\nSmall in stature, but highly influential, Olga Nicolai was born in 1875 in the Tyone Lake, Copper Center regions, where her father was a noted medicine man. In 1896, Olga married Simeon Ezi, one of the last chiefs of the upper Cook Inlet. \n\r\nCredited with much of the tribal lineage, the couple and their five children lived in the Native Village of Eklutna and took pride in the Indigenous customs—fishing in summer and hunting and trapping in the fall and winter. The family also operated a small boating business, shipping supplies from Anchorage to nearby villages. \n\r\nDena’ina artist and University of Alaska Fairbanks graduate Joel Isaak sculpted the installation, called One’s Spirit, over roughly two and a half years. The artist spent months talking with Alaska Natives about their unique features and customs, which shows in his detailed metal work. Olga’s shoes, for example, would have been made of fish scales. The artist mimicked that unique texture in his work. The statue was officially unveiled in January 2019.\n\r\nIn all, the Grandma Olga section of the installation includes the elder, a fish trap and rack, and bronze salmon lying on the concrete. Plaques nearby detail her contributions and those of the Dena’ina people. The surrounding area’s stunning coastal views and scenery make it worth a visit, too.",

Vibrant wooden posts, moose-hide boots, bark baskets, seal-skin tunics, intricate beadwork, and other Native art fill the exhibit rooms. \n\r\nThe Gathering Place serves as center stage for Native song and dance demonstrations, plus traditional games and storytelling. Outside, duck in and out of replica log cabins and underground cave-like structures that resemble ancient Native dwellings, and soak in the ways and customs of these close-knit, resilient communities. Culture bearers share stories and historic artifacts to help paint a picture of what life is and was like for Eyak, Yup’ik, and Athabascan peoples, among others. \n\r\nIn April 2022, the center received over 1,700 additional artifacts, including baskets, ivory figurines, carvings, a qayaq, the coat of an Athabascan chief, and more from the Wells Fargo Alaska Heritage Library and Museum, a gift that nearly doubled the center’s existing collection.\n\r\nOne notable relic, a full-scale whale skeleton outside, illustrates the importance of the whaling industry to provide clothing, oil, tools, and sustenance to the northernmost coastal peoples.",

More than half a century after Diet for a Small Planet—Frances Moore Lappé’s influential work on the need to reduce animal consumption—Kennedy makes a case for radically rethinking the place of meat in our warming world.\n\r\nShe has no intention of convincing all of her readers to go vegan or to adhere to the kind of moral puritanism with which the movement has often been wrongly associated. Instead, she takes an incisive look at the good, the bad, and the bizarre across the history of abstaining from meat, from religious sects to raw vegans, from toxic wellness culture to Silicon Valley–backed lab-grown meats.\n\r\nWhile she d…",

Most unusually the battens are recessed into the planks so that the door is flush on both sides.  In 2005, the door was dated using a process known as dendrochronology. A study showed that the wood was felled after 1032 and the door itself was constructed sometime in the 1050s, during the reign of King Edward the Confessor.\n\r\nFor its age, this door inspires us to look as good as we grow on in years. Don’t be among those who come for the famous crypts and then miss the door.",

On the bronze plaque at the rear of the statue is a curious circle of bees, all facing the queen in the center: the bees represent the state of Florence as an industrious community ruled by the grand duke. \n\r\nThe plaque has acquired a local legend. Some say that it is impossible to count the number of bees using only your eyes. Because of the irregular concentric arrangement, those who try will always lose count—said to be a deliberate trick on the part of the grand duke and the sculptor, Pietro Tacca, who finished the statue started by his teacher, Giambologna. (There are a total of 91 bees depicted on the plaque.)",

(\"Tahquamenon\" rhymes with \"phenomenon.\") The falls are actually a series—the largest of which, called the Upper Falls, stretches 200 feet wide and 48 feet high. Downriver of the Upper Falls you can find the Lower Falls, a series of five waterfalls cascading around a rowboat-accessible island.\n\r\nThe falls were first made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Song of Hiawatha,\" in which the main character Hiawatha builds his canoe \"by the rushing Tahquamenaw.\" Long before white men like Longfellow set eyes on the falls, however, it was long-used as a hunting and fishing site by the Ojibwa natives. Then, in the 1800s the river was used by loggers who used its current like a highway to transport timber harvested from deep in Michigan's upper peninsula to mills along the riverbank. \n\r\nThe trademark brown, cola-like color of the river is due to tannic acid absorbed from the surrounding cedar trees. Because of the color fo the water, this feature is known to some as \"Root Beer Falls.\"\n\r\nMore recently, the falls made an appearance on Sufjan Steven's 2003 album Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State in the form of a song title.",

Over 250 dinosaur footprints await you, along with crocodile scratches, and other trace fossils belying the ancient ecosystem.\n\r\nDinosaur Ridge offers visitors the chance to view and touch actual dinosaur tracks and dinosaur bones dating back to the Jurassic period. These tracks were first discovered in 1937 during the construction of the West Alameda Parkway.\n\r\nClues to unlock the past come in all sorts of shapes and sizes along the 2-mile round-trip trail, culminating in one of the most significant dinosaur bone quarries in North America, where Stegosaurus was first identified, and important research is still ongoing. Interpretive tours are available (and recommended!) with expert guides. Dig into the prehistory of this geologic and paleontologic wonder. The park offers full guided walking and bus tours, as well as a self-guided audio tour.",

My expectations were low as I drove back to the rental house and started looking at the sample through my microscope. Then I screamed.\n\r\nThe pieces of grass were coated with slimy brown film, and within it I saw a tiny, teardrop-shaped scaly cell wall with curved blue-green structures inside.

          "description": "Inaugurated in 2019, the eye-catching artwork 'Listen' in the center of Umeå depicts a roaring muscular feline sitting atop an almost cage-like steel structure 10 feet (3 meters) above the ground. The animal sculpture, which has an open gap filled with golden bronze, is made of polyester composite with Mazda red lacquer on the surface.\n\r\nThis permanent public installation symbolizes the Municipality of Umeå's official stance against sexual harassment. It's also the first monument in Sweden entirely dedicated to the social MeToo movement. While the formal name of the artwork is 'Listen,' locals call it \"the MeToo cougar.\"\n\r\nThe sculpture was created by Swedish artist Camilla Akraka (who is the sister to former Olympic athletics star Maria Akraka). She has described her installation as \"conservative aesthetics of power that meets a story of liberation,\" referring not only to the MeToo awareness campaign but also to the monument's contrasts between the free organic feline and the traditional powerful material qualities such as steel, car paint, and gold.\n\r\nWhen the €50,000 artwork was erected, it faced opposition from some local politicians who argued that allocating funds for what they perceived as \"political art\" was wasteful, particularly in light of recent education budget cuts. Even some feminists expressed concerns over the monument, viewing the representation of a cougar as \"objectifying\" towards women. However, the artist defended her work, emphasizing that the animal sculpture was never intended to be species-specific.",

But that’s the result of the last hundred years or so of vampire stories. In post-medieval Poland, undead evil was far more banal and less elegant; it was believed to possess the souls of those who had the misfortune to die early in epidemics, by suicide, or simply before being baptized. So when it came time to bury these poor souls, care was taken to ensure they would not provide an easy vessel for a malicious, supernatural force.\n\r\nIn late July 2023, archaeologists working on a 17th-century cemetery outside the southeastern Polish village of Pień excavated the remains of a child who appeared to have been interred in the period's \"a…",

          "description": "Nevada and the rest of the West were generally crisscrossed by stagecoach lines during the latter 19th century and even into the early 20th. It was a dusty, difficult, time-consuming, and an uncomfortable way to travel—but if there was no railroad, there were few alternatives.\n\r\nMany of these old lines were ephemeral, with little trace left today. Other routes are now followed by modern highways. In a surprising number of cases, however, the line persisted for a decade or more, but the route is still about as remote as it was back when the stages were thundering. Sometimes the original destinations became ghost towns. Sometimes the modern highway takes a route that was impractical in the old days, through being too steep for horse-drawn vehicles, or simply being too expensive for the resources at the time, as by requiring prohibitive amounts of excavation, or bridges that were beyond the state of engineering.\n\r\nPritchard's station lies on one of these abandoned routes. It was on the Belmont-Tybo-Eureka stage line from the 1870s into the 1880s. It even had a post office briefly in 1874. The ruin consists of a sturdy building with stone block walls on the outside, the remnants of a wooden roof, and some dilapidated interior wooden walls. Although a few foundations, probably from stables and pens, also occur just north of the station, it now appears as an incongruous lone building out in the desert.",

Typically, it depicts bookshelves full of “books and things” (chaekgeori), a pleasant eye candy to bibliophiles of all ages.\n\r\nIt was also a thematic inspiration behind the Gyeongui Line Book Street project in the Mapo district, intended to be a multipurpose cultural hub utilizing books to enrich people’s lives. Another inspiration was the Hongdae neighborhood surrounding it, an area with a high concentration of publishers in the past.\n\r\nThe vibrant Book Street runs for nearly four miles along Gyeongui Line, on the disused railroad tracks converted into a scenic promenade. It’s home to fourteen bookshops specializing in different themes and genres, all housed in train-shaped booths.\n\r\nThe promenade, a popular haunt among locals, also boasts a collection of book-themed public artworks, such as the statue of a girl standing on a library ladder and picking a book from the shelf.\n\r\nHip, refined, and relatively peaceful, Book Street is an intellectual oasis in the metropolitan hubbub of Seoul, perfect for solo walks, cute dates, or simple biblio-shopping.",

          "description": "The Kiyotsu Gorge has been appreciated as a site of natural beauty for many decades, but its popularity is only a recent development, thanks to an art installation that turned its panorama into a fantastical vista into another world.\n\r\nThe pedestrian tunnel was constructed in 1996 to respond to the demand of locals and tourists who wished to see the Gorge better, as the hiking route had been closed off due to a lethal rockfall accident in 1988. The tunnel stretches on for about half a mile, with three observation points midway and the \"panorama station\" at the end.\n\r\nDescribed by some as \"nothing but a boring tourist trap,\" the tunnel's popularity kept going downhill, the number of visitors steadily decreasing over the years. In 2018, however, it was chosen as one of the hundred-odd locations hosting the triennial Echigo-Tsumari art festival, with Chinese architect Ma Yansong of MAD Architects fame in charge of its artistic makeover.\n\r\nThe permanent art installation, \"Tunnel of Light,\" is nothing excessive that gets in the way of the panorama, but compliments the outstanding nature. Consisting of stainless steel walls and a thinly flooded floor, it creates a dreamlike reflection of the mountains beyond. Thanks to this Instagram-perfect feature, the number of visitors to the Kiyotsu Gorge more than quadrupled after the tunnel was revamped. Though not as widely known internationally yet, it may be just a matter of time until it becomes one of the top tourist attractions in Japan.",

They are distinctive, the white quartz typically standing out prominently from the background of ordinary rock, and bull quartz also sometimes hosts valuable mineral deposits. The gold in the hard-rock mines of the Mother Lode on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, for example, typically occurs in quartz.\n\r\nSo, when this large quartz deposit was discovered not long after the Gold Rush, the prospectors thought they'd discovered a bonanza, and the town of Crystal was laid out in 1864. However, the quartz proved to be barren. For a couple of years, a sawmill in Crystal cut timber for the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad a few miles south, but after the railroad bypassed the settlement, Crystal rapidly withered. Most people and businesses relocated to the new railroad town of Verdi, in Nevada, just east of the California state line.\n\r\nDuring World War II, some quartz for high-performance electronics was quarried, but the quarry has since reverted to public land now administered by the US Forest Service.",

Over the centuries, Butrint was also influenced by the Byzantines, Venetians, and Ottomans. This mix of civilizations and diverse types of architecture makes Butrint an exceptional archaeological site, recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1992.\n\r\nWhat's truly special about Butrint is its well-preserved state, allowing visitors to witness the layers of history that have shaped the city. From temples, basilicas, and theaters to defensive walls and castles, there is a rich array of structures to explore. The ancient theater, which dates back to the 3rd century BCE, stands out particularly showcasing the fusion of Greek and Roman architectural styles.\n\r\nMoreover, Butrint is not just a historical marvel, but also an ecological treasure. The hilly landscape within a protected area on the edge of Lake Butrint and the Vivari Channel makes it a significant habitat for various bird species and other wildlife. Visitors who want to combine archaeological exploration with nature walks can find great opportunities in this national park, which covers almost 9,500 hectares.",

Located close to its pier is the customs headquarters, an unusual historic building one might expect to find in Morocco rather than in Japan.\n\r\nConstructed in 1934, the Yokohama Customs headquarters is nicknamed “the Queen’s Tower” for its turquoise-domed minaret, and the rest of the building matches its style, with Moorish battlements and arched windows, partially inspired by ancient Indian architecture. There are also elements of Romanesque architecture here and there, creating an exotic vibe fit for a hub of international relations.\n\r\nThe construction plan was conceived as part of the Reconstruction of the Imperial Capital project, which sought to restore disaster-damaged cities in eastern Japan, as the original customs office was lost in the cataclysmic earthquake of 1923.\n\r\nInitially planned to be 154 feet (47 meters) tall, another 13 feet (4 meters ) were added to its height at the suggestion of the customs director. As a result, the Yokohama Customs building became the tallest structure in Yokohama at the time of its completion.\n\r\nIncidentally, the \"queen\" does not refer to any historical figure, but simply to the playing card, with the Kanagawa Prefectural Government office standing in for the King and the Yokohama Archives of History's clock tower for the Jack. Located close to each other, the three towers of Yokohama are a somewhat popular spot, best viewed from Ōsanbashi Pier.",

          "description": "Sometime during or just after the Civil War, a black rat in Williamsburg, Virginia, came into possession of a rare trophy: a solid silver fork. The rodent—a member of the ubiquitous species Rattus rattus, which arrived in North America with the Jamestown colonists—was living between the walls in a building that had variously been a home, a shop, a school, and a popular tavern. The rat’s family had likely been there for generations, gradually adding scraps of paper, fabric, crockery, bones, and miscellaneous debris to its massive nest. Pilfering the fork, however, was an unusual accomplishment for a creature that weighed about half a pound.\n\r\n“This was not a little tiny dessert fork—it was a dinner fork,” marvels Dani Jaworski, manager of architectural collections at the Colonial Williamsbu…",

          "description": "Just southwest of Charlotte, North Carolina, the ruins of a colonial open-pit iron ore mine are located on the hillsides of Nanny's Mountain. The mine was operational from approximately 1760 to 1820. Prior to the Revolutionary War, the iron mine fueled early industry in the area and was used to make pots, kettles, and other household items. During the war, the mine supplied ore for cannonballs, round shot, swords, cannons, and other weaponry.\n\r\nThe area around the mine saw several important Revolutionary War battles, including the pivotal battle of King’s Mountain, where American colonists soundly defeated British forces on October 7, 1780. It's possible that iron from this mine was used to make necessary supplies for the battle and may have made an important contribution to early American history. After the Revolution, some historians believe that this site was a stop on the Underground Railroad. \n\r\nThe mine pits can be viewed and explored along the short trail within the Nanny’s Mountain Historic Site Park. Pictures do not do justice to the size or depth of the pits. Keep in mind that these pits can be a safety hazard, so explore carefully.",

          "description": "As the Del Valle colonia (neighborhood) in Mexico City expanded in the 1960s, the small Catholic chapel that served this area became too small, so the local residents financed the construction of a larger building. Designed by architects Amaury Pérez de la Huerta García and Honorato Carrasco, work on the Parish of Divine Providence started in 1968, and was completed in 1974. In the midst of the Mexico City Summer Olympics, the city was caught up in a Modernist fervor, so many buildings designed at the time followed this architectural current.\n\r\nThis Parish's floorplan and appearance are somewhat like that of an open-hand fan, semicircular and defined by its 12 triangular panels that represent the 12 apostles of Christianity. Each of these features stained glass windows with geometric motifs in warm colors, a departure from the multicolored, figurative windows of many other places of worship. Another departure from traditional Catholic architecture, especially in Baroque-heavy Mexico, is its rather minimalistic interior.\n\r\nThe altar, located in the center of the semicircle, features a textured golden curved wall below a circular skylight which causes it to shine most of the day, with a cross hanging in front. The wall is framed by a pair of triangular structures featuring a wooden texture, making the interior relatively sober. The stadium-like seating surrounding the altar was designed as a result of a recent Vatican Council, which had determined that churches should strive to create a closer physical connection between altar and congregation.",

At first glance, it's nothing out of the ordinary, just an unassuming pavilion complimenting the garden, but it once stood on top of Qutub Minar.\n\r\nBuilt-in the early 13th century, the tower originally stood well over 300 feet tall and underwent several repairs throughout the ages. In 1803, its cupola was severely damaged in an earthquake, and Major Robert Smith of the British Indian Army sought to repair it. His pillared cupola was installed in 1828 as the sixth story of the tower but removed in 1848 as its architectural style was unfit for the ancient monument.\n\r\nThe cupola, dethroned and placed on the ground in the shadow of Qutub Minar, came to be known as Smith's Folly, as it simply serves no purpose. But perhaps it was a folly from the very beginning.",

This extraordinary olive tree, believed to be between 500-700 years old, defies its geographical limitations.\n\r\nThe tree belongs to the Hojiblanca variety, one of the 262 olive varieties cultivated in Spain and among the approximately 700 olive varieties found worldwide. Hojiblanca olives are utilized both for pickling and the production of olive oil. This particular tree originates from the Elche region in southern Spain.\n\r\nJeppa S Trädgård itself is a nine-acre botanical haven, featuring greenhouses representing various climatic zones, including tropical, Mediterranean, and a recently added subtropical greenhouse spanning more than 500 square yards.\n\r\nThe garden also houses a specialized plant shop offering a diverse selection of fruit trees from temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions. Visitors can enjoy refreshments, including coffee and ice cream, within the greenhouses. Additionally, the garden boasts a rhododendron collection of approximately 850 plants and a range of unusual trees, including the mammoth tree, bread fir, variegated beech, ginkgo, and aralia, scattered across the meadow and forest edges.",

          "description": "Much like its sister Fort of San José el Alto, the Fort of San Miguel was built in the 18th century. Both forts served to defend the city and the Bay of Campeche from pirate attacks. As a Colonial stronghold of Spanish authority, the city was often targeted by piracy, some of it actively encouraged by rival European powers like the British and Dutch.\n\r\nWhile the Yucatán Peninsula is generally known for its flatness, the presence of two hills in Campeche made for the perfect locations for both forts, which saw most of their action throughout the 19th century. After the establishment of independent Mexico and the decline of piracy, they would both eventually become museums. For the Fort of San Miguel, its role as the local archaeology museum has been much longer-lived and unchanged. Since its establishment in 1986, the museum has focused on mainly showcasing Maya artifacts from sites in the state, such as Calakmul. The bulk of its collection, however, spread across 10 halls, is made up of Jaina-style figures.\n\r\nLocated within the modern-day Petenes-Ría Celestún Biosphere Reserve, Jaina Island is believed to have been artificially built during the Maya Classic period and inhabited between 600-1100. Jaina meaning: temple or house on the water, has become the namesake of a style of clay figurines found there and on its nearby mainland. The figurines are noted for their unique detailing, which has led to them being highlighted in this museum.",

          "description": "The Darlingtonia Trail is named for the bog that it snakes around, filled with Darlingtonia californica, carnivorous pitcher plants. Called the cobra lily because their shape resembles an upright cobra, these plants lie in wait to strike at insects, their main source of nitrogen.  \n\r\nAt the first platform on the trail, you can see the bog in full bloom. At peak season, its full of hundreds of these gorgeous pitcher plants, some with bright flowers growing out. A few miles from the bog, the Smith River churns along. The area is full of a mineral called serpentine, which is gray-green in color and gives the Smith its brilliant blue-green color. The weathering of the serpentine produces magnesium, silica, and iron in the soil. It reduces the levels of calcium, potassium, and aluminum. To get the nitrogen and phosphorus that the plants need, they turn to a different source:  insects. \n\r\nThe pitcher plants have evolved to secrete nectar that attracts flies, ants, spiders, beetles, butterflies, and moths. They enter the plant and slide down into its long trumpet-shaped gullet, full of downward-facing hairs and slippery wall, becoming trapped at the bottom. There, the insect drowns and is slowly consumed by the plant. This is an extremely beautiful but extremely metal plant. \n\r\nSpeaking of metal, the area was extensively mined during and after the California Gold Rush. On the trail, you can also see a test mine shaft, probably dug to test for suitable minerals and metals to dig. They must not have found anything here, but the area has produced gold, chromite, and copper.",

Built to honor the ancestors and to assert their royal authority, many of the tombs consist of a huge burial mound and several temples.\n\r\nScattered over 18 locations across the Korean Peninsula, it’s not easy to see everything in one go, but one location has a huge cluster of royal tombs. Located in the city of Guri, right outside the perimeters of Seoul, is Donggureung: The Nine Eastern Royal Tombs.\n\r\nThe largest royal burial site in South Korea, Donggureung (also transliterated as Dongguneung) is home to the resting places of 17 kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty, originally founded by the order of King Taejong in 1408.\n\r\nThe “nine tombs” consist of Geonwonneung (King Taejo, 1408); Hyeonneung (King Munjong and Queen Hyeondeok, 1452); Mongneung (King Seonjo and Queens Uiin and Inmok, 1600); Sungneung (King Hyeonjong and Queen Myeongseong, 1674); Hwineung (Queen Jangnyeol, 1688); Hyeneung (Queen Danui, 1718); Wonneung (King Yeongjo and Queen Jeongsun, 1776); Gyeongneung (King Heonjong and Queens Hyohyeon and Hyojeong, 1849); and Suneung (King Ikjong and Queen Sinjeong, 1890).\n\r\nIn addition to these royal tombs, with their red pavilions, burial mounds, and funerary statues, the Donggureung complex also contains Myeongbinmyo (the grave of King Taejong’s concubine), the caretaker’s house, and a small museum. Surrounded by a serene forest and typically not as crowded as other historic attractions in and near Seoul, it’s quite a lovely place; one major shortcoming, perhaps, is that you can’t get close to the main parts of the tombs, as all the mounds are fenced at the foot.",

Dolphins, rays, and a variety of colorful reef fish can be found throughout the inlets, and the warm, clear water makes for excellent scuba diving and snorkeling.\n\r\nEasily explored in a day trip from the town of Kasab, most excursions will be aboard a traditional fishing vessel known as a dhow.

However, it is perhaps most well known for its 70 miles of beaches. \n\r\nUnless an avid and practiced sea diver, few visitors probably have little experience or knowledge of what is living in these watery depths. This is what makes the Map of the Grand Canyons La Jolla Shores so unique. Unveiled in October 2020, this 2,200 square-foot LithoMosaic not only depicts over 100 variety of species, (including aquatic varieties, as well as birds, mammals, and reptiles) but also the geological formations that can be found in and around this beachfront property.\n\r\nThe map was created to honor what would have been Walter Munk's 103rd birthday. Munk was an Austrian-born oceanographer who worked at the nearby Scripps Institute of Oceanography, as well as being a resident of La Jolla Shores. He was an avid proponent of understanding the effects climate change has on our environment, including the impacts on ocean temperatures. \n\r\nAlong with the Walter Munk Foundation for the Oceans, artist Robin Brailsford and her team of volunteers spent hundreds of hours mapping out and creating the massive display. Visitors are encouraged to walk on the art piece and discover the intricate details, as well as gain an understanding of what is taking place under the nearby waves. This includes 3-D models of reefs and the varying shades of blue tiles to indicate the various depths of the ocean floor.",

The affordable prices (ranging from just £6.50 for breakfast to £13 for lunch and dinner), make it as much of a favorite among local office workers as the students lodging there. \n\r\nFavorites among patrons include chicken korma and biryani, while Thursdays are dedicated to South Indian dishes like sambar, a spicy lentil soup. Freshly prepared home-style curries (the Kerala fish curry, egg curry and butter chicken are popular options), tandooris, onion bhajis, and dhal offer a filling feast for the senses. Rice and condiments, as well as drinks such as coffee and Chaas, a refreshing herb-infused yogurt drink, are complimentary.\n\r\nThe canteen, located on the building’s ground-floor Mahatma Gandhi Hall, is a central hidden gem for many Londoners, situated near Fitzroy Square and just a three-minute walk from Warren Street Station. Established in 1920, the hostel is a hub for the young Indian diaspora community in London, and offers a rich culinary and cultural space for British Indian history. Thanks to the communal dining hall setup, where tables are often shared between groups of strangers, conversations with new folks are common, lending to a comfortable, almost family-like atmosphere. \n\r\nWhile YMCAs are historically Christian institutions, the Indian YMCA prides itself on being an interfaith organization that embraces and celebrates all communities. Residents and visitors alike appreciate the inclusive environment where shared experiences warmly bring people together—regardless of religion, language or cultural heritage.",

          "description": "Tea is said to have originated in China about 2,700 years ago. It was brought to Japan by a mission of monks returning from Tang, and its earliest cultivation was in 1191, when the Buddhist priest Myōan Eisai sewed tea seeds in the Iwakamibō gardens of Ryōzen-ji Temple, Saga, not far from the ancient settlement of Yoshinogari.\n\r\nInitially meant to be a medicinal plant, Japanese tea soon evolved into its own kind, with a culture of tea ceremonies developing over the years. Eisai's tea became what is known as matcha today. It was widely appreciated by Buddhists practicing zen, as they believed it improved one's body and spirit.\n\r\nOn the grounds of Shōfuku-ji Temple in Fukuoka, the oldest zen temple in Japan originally established by Eisai himself, stands a direct descendant of his tea trees, known as the \"Japan's First Tea Tree.\" A small, nondescript tree with lean branches at first glance, it may not be anything extraordinary, but its influence on traditional Japanese culture is irreplaceable.",

          "description": "Walking through narrow, winding alleys of the Noryangjin district of Seoul, you may be reminded of gritty scenes from the Bong Joon-Ho film Parasite, a milestone in Korean cinema that took the 2020 Oscars by storm.\n\r\nWhile much of the filming took place at several locations in Seoul, the neighborhood is not especially featured in the film—except for a small, unassuming pizzeria called Sky Pizza. It’s nothing out of the ordinary, just a run-of-the-mill place with the usual menu. But on its façade and interior are autographs of Bong Joon-Ho, as well as the logo and delivery boxes of the fictional “Pizza Generation” restaurant from the film.\n\r\nParasite follows the tragicomedic lives of the poverty-stricken Kim family as they struggle to make ends meet, each member gradually infiltrating into the wealthier Park family, only for chaos to ensue. In one of the numerous low-income side jobs that the Kim family takes up, they fold delivery boxes for a local eatery: Pizza Generation. Later, the pizza place makes another appearance where the Kims are seen scheming on how to kick the housemaid out of the Park household.\n\r\nIn real life, Sky Pizza is a quiet family-run pizza joint. The owner will proudly offer visiting cinephiles the chance to take pictures with the Pizza Generation boxes, and bring you sketchbooks full of signatures and messages from Parasite-loving visitors from around the world, so that you can leave your own mark as well. Flipping through these pages, you'll see what a huge influence the film has had on a small local business like Sky Pizza.",

Designed in 1928, the theatre has survived hurricanes, fires, and even a near-demolition in the 1970s. But thanks to the hard work and dedication of the Lakeland community, the Polk Theatre was saved and continues to stand today as a testament to the city's love for the arts.\n\r\nWalking into the Polk Theatre is like stepping back in time. The art deco style of the building immediately transports visitors to a different era. The bright neon lights and intricate ceiling details make anyone feel like a movie star. And speaking of movies, the Polk Theatre has been showing them for almost a century— from silent films to talkies to new releases, the theatre has seen it all.\n\r\nBut movies aren't the only form of entertainment at the Polk Theatre. The venue also hosts live performances, ranging from plays to musical acts and symphony concerts. The acoustics in the theatre are second to none.\n\r\nThe Polk Theatre is not just a building made of bricks, but it is a place of great emotional significance to many. It is a cultural icon that has withstood the test of time and has been a source of joy for generations. All in all, the Polk Theatre is a cornerstone of Lakeland's culture and a testament to the city's love of the arts.

The popular myth claims that it was named after a local pregnant woman, Si, who sacrificed her own life to call upon an ancient guardian spirit to protect the city from an oncoming flood.\n\r\nAnother version of the story, perhaps resulting from mistranslation, has it that multiple pregnant women were sacrificed to prevent evil spirits from causing a disaster. Either way, the mythical Si Muang continues to be remembered and honored as a hero.\n\r\nThe temple itself houses a copy of the Emerald Buddha statue and a sacred stone pillar called the Lák Méuang, an ancient monument believed to enshrine the guardian spirit of the city, as well as several mini-shrines throughout the premises, some gorgeously kitsch.

If the native speakers of different languages, the thinking went, were able to communicate in a common tongue, they would understand each other better and consequently there would be less ethnic conflict.\n\r\nMany people invented languages with this dream in mind.

The latter, in particular, is their specialty, and it’s not surprising to find a queue spilling out onto the sidewalk at certain hours of the day when it’s due to come out of the oven. \n\r\nYou can customize your order by letting the staff know how fatty you’d like the char siu to be – if you’re unsure, boon fei sau, which means “half-lean half-fat,” is a good place to start. Char siu—or any Cantonese barbecue, in fact—can be enjoyed on its own as a snack or appetizer, like charcuterie, or pair it with plain rice to make it a proper meal.",

It’s one of the few places you’ll find cocktails made with Chinese liquors, from the traditional rice-based Yuk Bing Siu, to Magnolia, a recent local invention featuring Chinese medicinal herbs.\n\r\nIf you’re not in the mood for cocktails, there’s an excellent rotation of craft beers, both imported and local, on tap, bottled, or canned, as well as mocktails, and a neat menu of Asian-inspired dishes, from Okinawan taco rice to Sichuan fried chicken.

But before the land was purchased by the diocese in 1924, it was owned by Ronald Roy Conklin, a descendant of the original colonizers of Huntington and the owner of the North American Trust Company, which grew from a successful real estate partnership.\n\r\nConklin and his wife, the famous opera singer Mary McFadden, settled on what was then known as Rosemary Farm in 1913, living in a 30-room mansion overlooking Lloyd Harbor. Perhaps more fascinating though, is a treasure that lies just beyond the ruins of the home—an outdoor amphitheater built as a gift for McFadden.\n\r\nDesigned by Frederick Law Olmstead, of Central Park and Prospect Park fame, it hosted the National Red Cross Pageant in 1917, drawing thousands of guests and featuring a march led by John Philip Sousa. The amphitheater had an unusual design, with a moat in the center separating the audience and the performers on stage—quite the way to handle pesky hecklers!\n\r\nWhen the property was purchased by the diocese, the amphitheater fell into disuse, but has since been restored by the folks at the seminary. Few venture beyond the main building to explore the wonders in the backyard.",

          "description": "During construction works of the new Royal Collections Gallery, a set of ancient ruins was found. They include a section of the oldest Muslim wall, including several remains of houses attached and a pillar, part of the original gate of that primitive Madrid.\n\r\nThe wall was built in the late 9th century and made of large limestone ashlars, similar in technique to the nearby Tower of Bones and the Arab Wall. However, the remains found here are even older. Among these vestiges, it has been interpreted that a door of three meters (almost 10 feet) would correspond to that first gate of Madrid, the Puerta de la Sagra, (Xagra, in Arabic) very similar to the Puerta de Alcántara in Toledo. \n\r\nAll of these elements are linked to the origins of the foundation of Madrid by the Umayyad emir Muhammad I, in which the existence of a fortress in this place was justified because of its location. It bordered the Christian kingdoms of the north and sat on a high plateau protected by cliffs. \n\r\nAfter being hidden for centuries, the ruins have been incorporated into the permanent collection of the new museum and can be seen through a large glass. A video is projected in an adjoining room where the archaeological site is always in sight. The different parts of the old wall are illuminated. The exhibit shows the evolution of that ancient walled enclosure, first Muslim and then Christian, as well as the construction of the old Alcazar from the Habsburg dynasty to the current Royal Palace built on the Versailles style by the Bourbons in the 18th century.",

Along an inner road, a short distance away from St. Paul's Church near Pune Railway Station, in the center of the city, there is an empty patch of land along the side. In the corner of the plot are a number of interesting ancient stone structures. As one observes keenly, they are revealed to be old tombs. \n\r\nAccording to sources, these are European tombs from the 19th century. Historians, archaeologists, and other experts have studied them and have arrived at a number of possibilities regarding their origin and details. Some say these belonged to German soldiers from around 1850, while others are of the opinion that they date back to around 1817 and are of French soldiers who were said to be a part of the Peshwa Army. \n\r\nOne of the tombs is dome-shaped, supported with stone pillars. According to experts, it belonged to the wife of a French soldier. Along with soldiers, some of the tombs are also said to be those of local Europeans of that era. However, due to the withering of the plaques, it is difficult to ascertain the exact details with any degree of certainty. \n\r\nOne of the tombs has a tree growing vertically out of the stone slab. Another one has mysterious circular symbols carved over its sides. Then there is one which is completely covered with creepers while another has a gnarled tree trunk resting at an angle over its top. Since this place is along an inner road, not many people know of its existence, despite it being located in the center of the city. \n\r\nIt is a fascinating spot to explore on a weekend and thus discover this lesser-known side of the city’s history, particularly for people who have a penchant for mysteries.",

Home to the most prestigious university in the country, it served as the first capital of the Kingdom of Portugal and has had a strong monastic presence ever since. Across the river from the main part of town stands the ruined Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Velha. Originally founded by Lady Mor in the late 13th century, it became a favorite of Queen Elizabeth of Portugal, who built her palace next door.\n\r\nThe monastery operated until the early 17th century, when flooding from the Mondego River forced the nuns to move uphill and leave the monastery. And there it sat for 300 years, until it was excavated in the late 20th century.\n\r\nSanta Clara-a-Velha is most famous for being the execution site for Ines de Castro. In 1340, King Afonso IV arranged the marriage between his son Pedro and Constanza Manuel of Castille. Much to Afonso's displeasure, Pedro fell madly in love with Constanza's cousin Ines, and installed her in Coimbra as his mistress. Constanza gave birth to a son and heir to the throne, but after she died in 1349, Pedro refused to marry any other woman except Ines.\n\r\nFearing her influence on Pedro and any future sons they might have, in 1355 Afonso had Ines murdered in the Santa Clara-a-Velha monastery. Pedro had her killers brutally executed, and when Afonso died and Pedro became king, the legend goes that he had Ines' body exhumed and coronated as Queen.\n\r\nToday, Pedro and Ines are buried together in nearby Alcobaca, but their story has become one of the most well-known tragedies in Portuguese history. As for the monastery itself, it still experiences flooding every now and then, but visitors are now able to access the lower floors of the old monastery, including the choir and old treasury. Santa Clara-a-Velha remains one of the most complete and historically important Gothic ruins in the entire country.",

The ballroom was the site of numerous performers that included Glenn Miller, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, and Duke Ellington among many others.\n\r\nSingers of the era that performed there included Nat King Cole, Dean Martin, Mel Torme, the Andrew Sisters, Ella Fitzgerald, Doris Day, Perry Como, Billie Holiday, and Lena Horne to name just a few.   \n\r\nIn 1972, the Riviera Ballroom was turned into a privately-operated nightclub called “Top Deck” which operated until the early 1980s. Artists who performed at Top Deck included Donna Summer, Chubby Checker, Herman’s Hermits, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap, Gloria Gaynor, Chaka Khan, the Village People, and Cheap Trick, among others.\n\r\nA more complete list of the performers is listed on the wall on the 1st floor of the Riviera building (which is open to the public and has several small shops open from spring to fall).\n\r\nThe ballroom recently underwent an extensive renovation and now is a popular venue for weddings and other private, special events. While usually not open to walk-through, the inside is clearly visible from the exterior windows on the second-floor landing.",

Every day at the Swap Shop is something new, with kitschy interiors and mysterious vendors that are always changing.\n\r\nSwap Shop is the perfect combination of mass-produced discount grime, liminal spaces, garage sales, and a perpetually creaky carnival. From ever-churning children’s rides to DIY robot statues, old movie promotional items, grillz makers, indoor go-karts, arcade machines, and flower shops, Swap Shop has it all. You can visit just to take in the nonsensical decorations or to try your luck shopping.\n\r\nIf it exists, it exists at the Swap Shop in its most discounted, off-brand form. You can buy adult DVDs from a white windowless van and pick up themed tourist mugs just a few footsteps away.\n\r\nOn weekends, visitors are treated to paid parking across the street with a bright yellow pedestrian bridge to safely usher them into the world of dust, rust, and mystery. The bridge has its own strange statues that help set the tone. Weekdays are calmer, allowing visitors to park closer to the building.\n\r\nDiscounted flea market finds await at every corner. And for the empty stalls, relics of old movie promotional posters, dusty homemade decorations, and strange dioramas keep things entertaining. There are two floors of indoor booths plus semi-permanent outdoor container booths and an ever-changing lineup of cars selling their wares in the drive-in theater’s wavy parking lot.\n\r\nSpeaking of cars, the building also seems to inexplicably host a collection of flashy collectible cars—though it has dwindled in size in recent years.\n\r\nAdded bonus: Steve-O used to be a clown here before the TV show Jackass made it big.",

          "description": "Constructed in the early 12th century as a rural sanctuary far from the perils of war, Llanthony Priory continues to offer visitors a retreat from the pitfalls of modern life, even if the building itself hasn’t stood the test of time.\n\r\nThe grand abbey was founded by Norman knight William de Lacy, who—in a highly unconventional move for the time—traded the battlefield for religion, and created a hermitage in the shadows of Brecon’s Black Mountains.\n\r\nDuring the height of its popularity, up to 40 religious canons lived on-site at the abbey and visitors travelled to see it from around the world. Sadly this period of prosperity did not last. Following Henry VIII's set of 16th-century laws that worked to dissolve British monasteries, the site was largely abandoned and left to the elements.\n\r\nAnd yet, even as a ruin, the Monmouthshire site exudes a tranquil beauty befitting a monument that was once one of Wales’ great medieval buildings. Symmetrical stone arches still stand in a grand row, along with a few turret-topped stone towers, providing a sense of the scale of the original priory. So picturesque are the weathered remains that famed British artist J.M.W. Turner traveled here to paint them in 1794 (a watercolor that now hangs in the Tate Britain in London).\n\r\nAnd then, of course, there’s the pub. Hidden beneath the 900-year-old site, in what is thought to have once been the abbey’s cellar, is a wonderfully cozy undercroft bar, where in-the-know patrons duck down into a cave-like space to sample the selection of local ales on tap.\n\r\nThe old-worldly drinking den is run by the Llanthony Priory Hotel, which is attached to the site. The hotel has been set up to retain a sense of the abbey’s original role as a retreat from the modern world, and, as such, offers no in-room TVs, no wifi, and not even any mobile phone signal.\n\r\nAlong with drawing hikers, history buffs, and quirky pub enthusiasts, the area is also famed for its stargazing credentials, offering exceptionally clear views of the cosmos after dark.",

This scene happens frequently at the Dick Lane Velodrome, Atlanta’s official home of track cycling. While this velodrome is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary, many Atlantans are unfamiliar with this hidden gem.\n\r\nThe Dick Lane Velodrome is located just eight miles south of downtown Atlanta, in East Point’s Sumner Park. Residents of East Point were inspired to create a velodrome after watching the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. The group saw the racers on the Radstadion Velodrome in Olympiapark and decided they needed their own track. (\n\r\nThe course was completed in November 1974 at a cost of about $200,000. Some of the funds came from the Federal Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, the East Point Recreation Department, the State of Georgia, local civic groups, and East Point residents. Dick Lane, the namesake of the Dick Lane Velodrome, was a major fundraiser for the track. Lane was the Director of the East Point Recreation Department and a member of the Georgia State Legislature.\n\r\nThe Dick Lane Velodrome is a 1/5-mile track with 36-degree banked turns. In addition to the track and judges’ stand, it has a parking area, concession building, public seating, a picnic area, and restrooms. The track also offers equipment rentals. It is the only velodrome in the world with a green space containing a large oak tree and a creek running through the infield.\n\r\nThe East Point Velodrome Association, the non-profit group that manages and maintains the track, hosts a number of events throughout the year. Highlights include: Bicycle Safety Clinics, Beginner’s Program, Youth Cycling League, Advanced Training, Weekly Racing, and Pro Racing Series.\n\r\nThere are about two dozen active velodromes in the United States. The closest tracks to the Dick Lane Velodrome are in Ashville, North Carolina, Rock Hill, South Carolina, and Cooper City, Florida.",

They were entertainers and educators, meant to give New Yorkers their first glimpse of the prehistoric creatures that once roamed New Jersey forests and Connecticut lakeshores. But in 1871, these carefully crafted, life-size models were destroyed, smashed into worthless smithereens, and then buried in a small mound in Central Park.

          "description": "In October 1998, Asmita Kabra, a young economics professor, arrived for the first time in the place that would become Kuno National Park. A dryland forest in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, Kabra remembers how the monsoon that year had turned the trees so green that it hurt her eyes. In the flush of harvest, homes of the local Sahariya people overflowed with goods gathered from the forest, notably chir: a fragrant, green-yellow resin, also known as Indian frankincense, that comes from the salai tree.\n\r\nKabra expected to visit Kuno just a couple times, but the place got under her skin, she says. She grew to love its dramatic cycles of drought and abundance. After each rain, the dry brown landscape transformed into a verdant paradise. When Kabra started teaching at Ambedkar Unive…",

The crown jewel is the collection of King Oscar II, considered by many to be the world's first open-air museum. First set up at the monarch's summer residence in 1881, the original five buildings included a 16th-century farmhouse and a 12th-century storehouse.\n\r\nMost impressive of all is the Stave Church from Gol, a magnificent wooden cathedral first built around 1200 and partially rebuilt and restored in 1880. Intricate carvings cover the richly detailed interior.\n\r\nAlthough the church was once filled with brightly painted statues of Catholic saints, today all that remains are the places where the figures once stood and occasional cryptic runes. The nave of the church still reads “Kiss me, because I struggle,” possibly in reference to one of the lost sculptures.",

One of them according to municipal records states that the square got its name from a sun-decorated medieval wall shutter that was destroyed in the 17th century. The other theory is that a gate was built with the sun's rising direction in mind—to the east.\n\r\nThe square has undergone many refurbishments, but this symbol remains as a nod to the past.",

          "description": "In Karen, a leafy suburb of Nairobi, chef Dennis Ang’ani whips up a unique fusion experience for just 12 visitors per seating on a greenery-laden cabin terrace. The multi-course dining concept is primarily inspired by local produce and traditional East African recipes done up with culinary techniques picked up by Ang’ani abroad.\n\r\nRoot and vine vegetables are freshly plucked from Embark’s own gardens. Ingredients are showcased using European techniques, from foams to fermentation, with elaborate presentations, and occasional garnishes of flowers plucked from Nairobi’s Physic Garden.\n\r\nExpect a walk on the earthy side: a chilled banana and rum soup with a garden salad in Bailey’s and macadamia nut vinaigrette, seared tofu in Ethiopian shiro (a spicy chickpea sauce), or mini plantain burgers. Vegetable-based desserts often tread into especially wild, savory territory; from Amarula-braised eggplant with aerated broccoli ice cream, to ugali (corn maize) with creamed spinach.\n\r\nAll in all, the menu reflects Ang’ani’s multicultural experiences. After growing up in a German-Kenyan household, he moved around Europe working in kitchens from the Baltics to Barcelona, and fluently speaks German, English, Swahili, and Spanish.\n\r\nThough as a child he dreamed of becoming a pro soccer player in Europe, he maintains that bringing an innovative approach to the African fine-dining scene has been a more fulfilling challenge for him than any league could be; and even requires similar skills like dexterity, teamwork and performance under pressure. \n\r\nA picture of Coach Pep Guardiola, one of Ang’ani’s heroes, hanging from a wall-mounted handwoven basket, helps him to remember the importance of being a good leader and most importantly, to never be limited by conventionality and cultural borders.",

This mixture got its name because looked like a deadly form of porridge.\n\r\nPrior to the building of HM Grenta, this location was quiet, with only a few farms and villages in the area. Then World War I began. In just 12 months, the government acquired the land and built a massive factory. The HM Gretna site was huge, it covered a distance of nine miles, stretching down to England.\n\r\nThere were 30,000 workers, 12,000 of whom were women. Lots of the munitions girls moved to the area, especially to work at the factory, moving from areas like Durham, Darlington, and Sunderland. The chemicals were highly toxic, the girls' skin would turn yellow and they often lost all of their teeth. The contribution to the war effort made by the munitions girls here at HM Gretna helped women achieve the vote in the United Kingdom.\n\r\nBy 1917, the factory was producing 1,100 tons of cordite a week. This was significantly more than all the other munitions factories in Britain put together. This explosive was then shipped out to the troops on the front line.\n\r\nThe museum has a special version of a train, a fireless locomotive, designed to safely transport the explosive on display in the grounds. The museum tells the story of the girls who worked here and the Irish navvies who built the massive factory.\n\r\nIt also covers a horrific troop train crash at Quintinshill. While the second floor is dedicated to WWII. With a small section covering nuclear power and the local nuclear power station.",

It’s not a warning of a tsunami or other disaster, but for a far more pleasant occurrence: a whale sighting.\n\r\nOccasionally, a baleen whale, such as a humpback, strays from the migratory superhighway off the coast and into Twofold Bay in Eden. The alarm atop the tiny town’s killer whale museum is sounded to notify the town’s 3,000 or so residents and any tourists to this scenic stretch of coastline. Over 150 years ago, the town hosted a different marine show. Orcas, or killer whales, the largest of the dolphin family, used to visit this bay every winter, and were vital to a unique way of life in Eden.

          "description": "Upon first glance, this may look like just another historic building found across Boston. However, upon entering the Liberty Hotel, one realizes this was no ordinary building but rather once a jail that was in operation for more than a century.\n\r\nOriginally known as the Charles Street Jail or  Suffolk County Jail, it's located on the west end of the city overlooking the Charles River. It was constructed between 1848-1851 and proposed by Mayor Martin Brimmer during his inaugural address of 1843 as a replacement for the older Leverett Street Jail.\n\r\nThe original jail was built using Quincy granite with four wings extending from a central octagonal rotunda and housed around 220 cells. The prisoners were segregated by sex and nature of offense with 30 arched windows providing ventilation and natural light.\n\r\nThroughout its years of operation, it housed a wide range of inmates from mob hitmen to a former governor. In 1973, the United States District Court ruled that due to overcrowding and neglected conditions, the constitutional rights of the inmates were being violated and the jail closed in 1990. It reopened in 2007 as the Liberty Hotel with much of the historic architecture still preserved.",

One of those few occasions was when he accepted the chance to work on this palace in Astorga, León.\n\r\nBishop Joan Baptista Grau I Vallespinós decided to entrust the construction of the new episcopal palace to his friend Gaudí, who just like the bishop, came from Reus, Tarragona. Gaudí's imaginative touch is evident in the innovative use of materials, incorporating iron, brick, and ceramics alongside traditional stone.\n\r\nGaudí made a significant mark on the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, Spain, with his distinctive architectural style. The palace, constructed between 1889 and 1915, stands as a brilliant fusion of various influences, showcasing Gaudí's innovative ideas and artistic vision.\n\r\nThe most striking feature of Gaudí's intervention in the palace is the facade. Adorned with a combination of organic and geometric motifs, it reflects his fascination with nature and its organic forms. The building's interiors also bear Gaudí's creative flair, with unique decorative elements and functional yet aesthetically pleasing spaces.\n\r\nGaudí's work on the Episcopal Palace in Astorga exemplifies his ability to transform existing architectural designs into masterpieces that harmoniously blend traditional and avant-garde styles. The building stands today as a testament to Gaudí's genius, drawing visitors from around the world to marvel at its beauty and architectural significance.",

This small act of kindness has been appreciated by hundreds of bees—and warmed the hearts of thousands.\n\r\nThe honeybee drinking fountain was first created in 2016, but it did not reappear for the next four years due to the lack of apian visitors during that time. Attached to the ablution pavilion, the fountain’s platform is made from bamboo and stuffed with moss, which provides a footing for the bees and creates the feeling of a serene fairytale scene.\n\r\nThe small sign standing on the drinking fountain reads “a drinking spot reserved for groups of honeybees,” but paper wasps are also often seen drinking water from it. They do not only drink water to cool themselves down, but also carry it back to their hives to keep the temperature comfortable so that the babies are not harmed by the summer heat.",

He embarked on a remarkable journey in the 14th century that took him through Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and beyond, covering a distance believed to be over 75,000 miles.\n\r\nBattuta was born in Tangier in 1304 and set out on his travels at the age of 21. His adventures spanned nearly three decades, during which he explored various regions, experienced different cultures, and met numerous rulers and dignitaries.\n\r\nHis written account, known as the Rihla, provides invaluable insights into the medieval world, shedding light on the diverse cultures, customs, and political landscapes of the places he visited. Battuta's travelogue serves as a significant historical source, capturing the socio-economic conditions, religious practices, and intercultural exchanges of the time, making it an indispensable resource for scholars and a captivating literary work that continues to inspire wanderlust and cultural curiosity.\n\r\nThere are plenty of historical markers or memorials related to Battuta in the city, given his significant contribution to Moroccan and world history. As a prominent figure, he is also celebrated throughout Morocco and the broader Muslim world for his travel accounts and contributions to geographical knowledge.",

Ranging from different time periods, denominations, and congregations, churches across America have been a defining feature throughout the nation's history. Although many churches have a unique history, there is one church in Framingham that has a particularly notable distinction as being the first public performance and singing of the Battle Hymn of the Republic.\n\r\nThe church was founded in 1701 and by the time of the American Civil War, it was called the Hollis Evangelical Congregational Church. On the evening of February 22, 1862, the residents of Framingham gathered in the church to celebrate the 130th anniversary of George Washington's birthday and read aloud his 1796 farewell address as encouraged by President Lincoln via national proclamation three days earlier. The speech was read by Norman School principal George Bigelow and the program was concluded with the singing of Battle Hymn of the Republic by Julia Ward Howe which was published in The Atlantic Monthly that same month. \n\r\nThe song became extremely renowned in the United States with its abolitionist and religious themes resonating strongly with supporters of the Union cause during the American Civil War. It was one of the most popular songs among Union troops and became a staple of United States military music. Today, it's considered a classic patriotic song with many renditions, tributes, and parodies.",

Both within and around the city, there are several lush green hills where visitors can find historic forts, temples, monuments, and caves.\n\r\nARAI Hill, also known as Vetal Hill, is the highest point in the city at an elevation of over 2,000 feet. The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) is located here. A temple of Vetal and a few other temples are also located on the hill. A short distance from ARAI and the temples is a large abandoned stone quarry that has formed a lake.\n\r\nThe quarry is a paradise for nature lovers. Every morning and evening, people visit the hill for walking, jogging, photography, bird watching, yoga, meditation, exploring nature, and watching the city from one of its highest points. The hill is accessible from multiple areas, as there are walking trails from all sides. All the trails converge towards the center at the top, where the stone quarry lake is located.\n\r\nSome portions of the hill are covered with dense trees, while others are grasslands. The quarry lake, with its marshy areas and shallow waters, has created a wetland with an ecosystem of its own. One can spot several rare and exotic bird species here.\n\r\nThe hill is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The views offered from here are breathtaking.

          "description": "King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia presided over the inauguration of the Queen Victoria Bridge on June 13, 1909. The bridge was named in honor of the king's wife. It connects Bombilla Park, the two hermitages of San Antonio de la Florida, with the Colonia de San Antonio de La Florida and the Colonia del Manzanares.\n\r\nBased on a design by architect Julio Martnez-Zapata Rodriguez, it was built by engineer José Eugenio Ribera Dutaste. The bridge includes two, parallel elliptical reinforced concrete arches that are decorated in modernist style. It also has two lanes for cars. Additionally, Queen Victoria Bridge is one of Spain's earliest concrete bridges. Four vases and eight cast-iron lampposts decorated by Francisco Iglesias with bears serve as its adornment.\n\r\nDuring the Second Spanish Republic, the bridge changed its name to Puente de Galicia. After the Spanish Civil War, it recovered its original name. On one of its sides, visitors can see a commemorative plaque placed on June 13, 1999, to celebrate its 19th anniversary.\n\r\nIts ornamental components, which are mostly concentrated on the board, reflect the modernist trends of the day. Four vases and eight iron lampposts (two and four at each end) are placed on it, at the base of which different rampant bears appear, in a clear reference to the heraldic shield of Madrid.",

William Moore and his wife Agnes were an important part of society in Norman. The house was later sold to Agnes’ niece and her husband, Harry, and Daisy Lindsay.\n\r\nThe remnants of Daisy Lindsay’s locally famous rose garden can still be seen on the property next door. In the 1960s, the family sold the house and it was divided into apartments. They didn’t last long, however, before the building was condemned. The city of Norman saved the house and opened it as a museum in the 1970s. \n\r\nThe museum is now furnished as an example of the typical Oklahoma Victorian house. The house contains artifacts from around Cleveland County, including a woman’s side-saddle ridden by Martha Giles in the Land Run of 1889.        \n\r\nThe museum hosts frequent events for both adults and children, including tea parties, soap-making, embroidery classes, children’s camps, and even paranormal investigations.",

When this plaza was being built, a large stone ring with a figure carved on it was unearthed. This was a tlachtemalácatl, the name in Náhuatl (the language of the Aztec/Mexica people) for the \"goals\" of the Mesoamerican Ballgame. Known as tlachtli, variants of this game were played by the Indigenous peoples of most of Mexico and Central America, almost always with ritualistic and symbolic purposes.\n\r\nThis particular malacatl of the tlachtli game was so well-carved that it was kept after being found, and eventually placed in a prominent position in the Jesús Reyes Heroles House of Culture, in what is now the Mexico City borough of Coyoacán. This cultural center was once an actual house, and its late 18th-century architecture shows it. It also functioned as a paper factory for some time, and in 1985, was established as a House of Culture.\n\r\nIts namesake, Jesús Reyes Heroles, was a significant 20th-century intellectual who delved into law, politics, and history. Usually advocating in favor of democratic values and human rights, his legacy led to many institutions other than this center being named after him.",

That is what happened to Real de Catorce in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí when its silver ran dry in the early 20th century. But it was never completely abandoned. \n\r\nThe land around the town, particularly the desert below, is known as Wirikuta, the sacred land of the Huichol people. Real de Catorce has long been a pilgrimage site for them due to its proximity to Wirikuta. It's also a place of pilgrimage for Roman Catholics. The Parish of Immaculate Conception Cathedral draws visitors hoping to ask a favor from Saint Frances Assisi.\n\r\nToday, the town sees pilgrims of a different sort, namely tourists in search of the magic that keeps visitors coming to this out-of-the-way location. When silver mining ended over a century ago, the town's population dropped down to the hundreds. Today the town has around a thousand permanent residents. The sizable tourist flow keeps its small hotels busy. \n\r\nMuch of the town is abandoned. Be sure to visit the historic bullfighting ring and its amphitheater. A hike up to the hills will give you a panoramic view of the town and its surroundings. Throughout the town, the Huichol sell their intricate, colorful artwork.",

          "description": "In May 1974, a 27-year-old director named Steven Spielberg set out to make a movie about a shark, based on a hit novel that had come out just months earlier, also about a shark. In August 2023, a new Broadway play is opening at the Golden Theater on West 45th Street in New York, The Shark Is Broken, about the trials, tribulations, and humor of the making of the movie—Jaws, obviously—that changed the film industry.\n\r\nThe play dramatizes the bickering between three stars of the film—Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider, and Robert Shaw, whose son Ian co-wrote and stars in the play—and the difficulties of having a giant, animatronic shark as a scene partner. Back in 1974, it wasn’t just the fake shark that presented challenges—the production was menaced by real live sharks before the real filming e…",

Seelos traveled to the United States, first residing in New York to minister to German-speaking immigrants. During his lifetime, Seelos witnessed the chaos of the American Civil War.

Nestled close to the Spanish border, the town sits among the foothills of the French Pyrenees and is renowned for its thermal springs. For centuries, especially in the Victorian period, attracted people in poor health looking to convalesce in a scenic setting. One can easily imagine bourgeois visitors coming to Luchon to bask in therapeutic waters, perhaps as they cough discretely into a bloodstained lace handkerchief.\n\r\nToday, Luchon's tourists enjoy the benefits of the waters sans illnesses. Modern upgrades to the Thermes buildings demonstrate that Luchon's restorative springs remain as popular as ever with visitors.\n\r\nThe local architecture is a curious mix of Belle Epoque grandeur and Tyrolean ski resort, unsurprising, given that the town also caters to skiers and snowboarders who venture into the snow-capped mountains every winter. The town remains a beautiful spot to enjoy a coffee at a boulevard cafe while admiring the majestic mountain range that dominates the town's skyline.\n\r\nThese breathtaking peaks also captivated the writer, poet, and playwright Edmond Rostand who spent many summers enjoying the unique pleasures of Luchon while residing at Villa Julia, a holiday home built by the Rostand family. Here, Edmond composed love letters and wrote his most famous literary work, Cyrano De Bergerac.   \n\r\nA commemorative bust was erected in 1922, four years after Rostand's death at the age of 50. The statue features his curly mustache and an unmistakable creative air as the statue looks wistfully into the middle distance seeking inspiration. Appropriately the bust sits where his effigy can view the mountains, the river Pique, and Villa Julia.  \n\r\nIt's a discrete but fitting tribute to a man known as France's National Poet who gave the world one of its most famous literary characters and who found vast reserves of inspiration in the splendor of the Pyrenees and the charming spa town of Luchon.",

The establishment doubles as a social initiative startup where all fresh-baked confections are made by local elderly folks.\n\r\nFounded in 2014, Kuchentratsch serves some of the city’s best traditional German cakes. Depending on the season, and who’s aproned-up that day, a delectable selection may include anything from rhubarb torte to crumb cake (Streuselkuchen) to marble cake (Marmorkuchen). Cakes are displayed in a glass vitrine next to the name of the Oma or Opa (grandma or grandpa) who made them.\n\r\nCakes are delivered Germany-wide but for sit-in guests, the bakery provides cozy tables in an inviting interior. Think: large glass windows are adorned with plush armchairs against a strawberry-pink ceiling. Throughout the day, elderly folks bake in an open kitchen and socialize around tables, gabbing while waiting on their oven timers. Pensioners work part-time at Kuchentratsch, and many spend their retirement time getting together here, even when they’re not on duty for the dough.\n\r\nThe wafting aromas of warm treats and happy banter contribute to the ambience that owners Katharina Mayer and Katrin Blaschke always wanted: an interactive “experience bakery” spanning tastes and generations. Along with frequent baking workshops, Kuchentratsch aims to support the elderly with a fun hobby that provides purpose, prevents loneliness and supplements pensions with extra pocket money.\n\r\nSo, whether you go for the poppy seed crumble or a chocolate cake made especially for the vegan crowd, rest assured that, as the German saying also goes in English, “the way to one’s heart is always through the stomach.”",

          "description": "Taiwan, an island, cherishes seafood as a culinary staple. For generations, seafood soups and congee used to dominate the breakfast tables and early morning street food stall menus, until they were slowly phased out for more popular wheat-based dishes like scallion pancakes and egg crepes. Emmanuel is one of the few exceptions and has been whipping up comforting bowls of hot tilapia soup for hungry customers in the morning since 1977. \n\r\nFor decades, the place was an old road side stall servicing blue-collar workers. But in 2021, the third-generation owner convinced his parents to take over and give the brand a 21st-century face-lift. They’ve since relocated to a cozy brick-and-mortar space with indoor seating and air conditioning. \n\r\nDespite the refresh, the menu and the prices have stayed exactly the same: whole slabs of fish sourced fresh from the market daily are served in soup, usually paired with a hearty serving of stir-fried rice vermicelli with a heaping of braised ground pork, crunchy bean sprouts, and housemade chili sauce. Every fish is carefully skinned and gutted and served whole—with the head, eyes, and fins still intact. \n\r\nWhile the menu is small, there is something for everyone on it. If fish isn’t your thing, they do a classic egg drop soup or one topped with hearty slices of pork.The best part? The prices for each dish has stayed well under 100 NTD ($3 USD).",

Stocked with movie paraphernalia and books, it is the brainchild of Taiwanese director Wei Te-sheng, whose Cape No. 7 was Taiwan's second highest-grossing movie of all time and achieved the longest theatrical release in the island’s cinematic history. \n\r\nThe food is typical cafe fare: coffees, teas, sandwiches, waffles. For something more substantial, they do a decent barbecued pork, sliced into thin pieces, paired with a sunny side-up egg and served over rice. There are grilled rice balls and bright salads. Even local craft beer if one is so inclined. \n\r\nHowever, the food is secondary because the main draw at Real Guts is the decor. There are old film cameras, director clapboards from Wei’s movie sets, and two real Golden Horse awards (considered the Oscars of Chinese-language cinema) on display. There’s also an entire bookshelf brimming with storyboards and set design drafts, plus a merchandise section selling miscellanea like T-shirts of endemic Taiwanese animals. \n\r\nWhile it’s all a bit chaotic, Real Guts draws a consistent crowd of work-from-home folks and students, who like the floor-to-ceiling windows and lush foliage that hangs from the nooks and crannies of the space. Stocked with a reasonable amount of outlets and Wi-Fi, it is a relaxing place to pull up a laptop and get some work done.",

Think three years versus 30. We humans can live twice or three times as long as our closest relatives, chimpanzees.\n\r\nIt’s natural to ask which mammal lives the longest. Spoiler alert: It’s the bowhead whale. (There are a few other, non-mammalian creatures that have them beat: a deep-dwelling shark, a clam, a jellyfish that just doesn’t die at all.)

The name \"dairy\" may have been a corruption of \"dowry\" and it has been inferred that the property was once a widow's home.\n\r\nWhile some of the original windows were once bricked up, over the years many of them have been reopened. On the upper floor, there is a small chapel with one of the small windows while the other miniature window looks out from the other side of the house.\n\r\nOne local story claims that the floor contains remnants from a Roman road, which once ran along the banks of the river Kent.",

          "description": "For first-timers, a trip to Taiwan isn’t complete without a hearty bowl of beef noodle soup. A dish unique to the island, it was invented in the mid-20th century by refugees who had left the Chinese mainland for Taiwan during the Chinese civil war. Today, it’s become somewhat of the national dish of Taiwan. But with over 10,000 dedicated beef noodle soup shops on the island, narrowing down the options is a harrowing task. \n\r\nChef Hung Beef Noodle Soup is a great place to start. The eponymous owner Hung Ching-Lung is a five-time award-winning champion of the annual beef noodle soup competition in Taiwan—the most decorated winner in the event’s history. \n\r\nThe restaurant’s menu offers a diverse overview of the beef noodle soup options on the island, from a classic star-anise-heavy broth flavored with spicy bean paste to a minimally seasoned clear broth where delicate slices of beef are highlighted. A couple of Hung’s award-winning bowls are on the menu as well: there’s one topped with tripe, tendon, and shank and another with medium rare, paper-thin slices of beef overlaid on top. \n\r\nFor Chef Hung, beef noodle soup is much more than just a profession. It’s a passion. He has a cattle farm on the outlying island of Kinmen, where he raises his own cows for the restaurants. And he’s often tasked with training up-and-coming chefs on how to make a fantastic beef broth for their restaurants. He says the key is procuring a really high-quality cut of beef and making a flavorful broth. Everything else is just secondary.",

          "description": "The church of St. George the Martyr is the oldest Anglican church in Southeast Asia. Before the church was built, religious services in Penang were conducted at Fort Cornwallis and later at the courthouse in George Town, a short distance away. Plans for a church were submitted as early as 1810 but it wasn’t until the East India Company Act of 1813 gave the British East India Company authority that the church was built. It was constructed in 1818 and consecrated in 1819 costing some 60,000 Spanish dollars (also known as \"pieces of eight\").\n\r\nThe first significant event that took place in the church after its completion was the wedding of Governor William Edward Philips to Janet Bannerman, the daughter of his predecessor, Colonel John Alexander Bannerman on June 30, 1818.\n\r\nOn the grounds stands a memorial to Francis Light, a British explorer and the founder of the British colony of Penang and its capital city George Town in 1786. Interestingly, he is also the father of William Light, who founded the city of Adelaide in Australia.\n\r\nThe church was first restored after being looted and badly damaged during the Japanese occupation of Malaysia in the Second World War. It was restored again in 2011 after being designated a National Heritage in 2007.",

Inside: a cheeky diner awash in red lighting, analog phones, floral print diner chairs, plush banquettes, and a working disco ball in the corner. Keeping with the theme, the shelves are stocked with magazines crammed with centerfolds of busty, scantily clad women.  \n\r\nThe aesthetic of Pure Love is a nod to the “grandpa shops” of Taipei—old-school karaoke rooms where older men are known to seek the company and services of flirtatious waitresses. Big in the ‘60s and up to the ‘80s, they have since waned considerably in popularity after a crackdown in prostitution in the ‘90s.  \n\r\nPure Love Snack Bar is a modern revival of the grandpa shop, but without any of the shady or illegal dealings. The food is unpretentious and rooted in Taiwanese classics like braised pork over rice, oyster soup, fried chicken, and deep-fried noodles smothered in an earthy satay sauce. The drinks are more elevated and utilize locally available flavors like guava, tieguanyin tea, and mulberry.",

The term “tea house” is a misnomer; Jinjiang is a full-service restaurant dedicated to Hakka cuisine—the fare of a Han Chinese subgroup known for its emphasis on salty and smoked meats and a love of pickles. \n\r\nSituated in an 80-something-year-old house dating back to the Japanese colonial occupation of Taiwan, the restaurant is a quaint cottage in a forest of skyscrapers. The inside is just as charming, with outdated white ceiling tiles, wooden tables, and shelves stuffed with cute knick-knacks and miscellaneous clutter. \n\r\nThe food is as wholesome as the decor. They do cold poached chicken—the skin crisp and gelatinous—served with a kumquat dipping sauce. There’s a lovely salted pork, sliced into bite-sized pieces, which pairs especially well with a hot bowl of short-grain rice dressed with soy  sauce-flavored lard.\n\r\nThe tender shoots of bird’s nest ferns are sauteed with the pickled seeds of a bird lime tree. There’s slippery noodles made with green tea, and thick belts of rice noodles with minced pork. Dessert is complimentary—usually a bowl of grass jelly, a mint-like herb beloved among the Hakka in Taiwan, or small mochi balls dressed with sweet ground peanuts. \n\r\nFor the full experience, finish off with lei cha, a ground tea made with pounded grains. It’s akin to matcha, but less vegetal and more toasted and nutty.",

          "description": "Some 1,000 years ago, the Normans pushed north attempting to subjugate part of Westmorland. As part of this effort, Castle Howe was built. Kendal’s undisputed first castle, Castle Howe, was built in 1092 and overlooks the town.\n\r\nThe fortifications consist of a well-defined motte, rising to around 33 feet and measuring around 59 feet in diameter at the summit. The base of the motte measures around 150 feet, and is surrounded by ditches and embankments. The bailey lays to the east of the motte, and is roughly triangular in shape, and was turned into a bowling green and is now a public park.\n\r\nThe Barony of Kendal fell at the hands of Ivo de Taillebois around 1092 and as a reward for his unfailing military support and success, Ivo was granted the Barony of Kentdale, a title that brought with it huge swathes of land in what is now Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbria.\n\r\nKendal Castle, to the east of the earthworks, was probably built while Castle Howe was still being used. Likely, Castle Howe was the baronial center of Kirkland, and Kendal Castle was the baronial center of Kentdale. Castle Howe eventually became redundant, as did the Kendal Castle, and the administrative center of Kendal moved to the Moot Hall in the center of town.\n\r\nIn 1788, to celebrate the centenary of the revolution of 1688, an obelisk was erected on the summit of Castle Howe. The monument was designed by architect Francis Webster who was a native of Kendal.",

The district of Hansaviertel was a rich urban neighborhood, and quite desirable thanks to its proximity to the city center while being right next to Tiergarten Park. But after the Second World War, it was almost completely leveled.\n\r\nEast Berlin had been rebuilding over the 50s, courtesy of its new socialist government and the West didn’t want to be left behind. To show that they were a new free and capitalist society, they also decided to rebuild, and the destroyed district of Hansaviertel proved to be an ideal location.\n\r\nMore than 50 architects were invited to work on the project, German and international alike. There were some famous names in the group, including Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer, the designer of the new Brazilian capital. Each presented their own future vision of housing.\n\r\nThe district contains a school, a kindergarten, a shopping center with a library and a theatre, and even an academy of arts. Additionally, every house has some special spin. They usually have descriptions on the ground floor somewhere, though a guide can be bought at the shopping center at a club made for this district",

In Miyakojima, the local traffic safety association tried a slightly new way back in the 1990s, when five policemen-like figurines were set up at various crossings around the island. These were known as Mamoru-kun patrolmen. \n\r\nAs the story goes, Mamoru-kun was born on August 5, 1991. He stands 180 centimeters tall, and his official titles are \"Miyakojima Safety Association Staff\" and \"Miyakojima Police Transportation Division Officer.\"\n\r\nOver the years there have been more figurines set up all over the island. Currently you can find 20 Mamoru-kun in various places in Miyakojima. Nineteen of these patrolmen are male, but at the Miyakojima Police Station, you can also find his female colleague Maruko-chan.\n\r\nThanks to their loyal service in all weather conditions, Mamoru-kun was also given a special Miyakojima residence permit by Mayor Toshihiko Shimoji in a ceremony back in 2012.\n\r\nOriginally these figurines were considered kimo (creepy), but recently Mamoru-kun have got their own fanbase. With their popularity rising, you can now also find Mamoru-kun cookies, soft drinks, and more.",

          "description": "Rather than driving through a tunnel beneath the Alps, this pass offers unparalleled views as you traverse over the mountains. The scenic route connects Val-Cenis in Western France with Susa in Italy, and was one of the most well-traveled paths through the Alps during the Middle Ages. The road will take a few hours to traverse, but the views and sights along the way are well worth it. \n\r\nSome scholars believe that this is the exact pass that Hannibal took with his army and war elephants in 218 BC. More than a millennia later, in 1414, Niccolò III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara took this route back to Italy after meeting Charles VI in Paris. Niccolò described the pass as having \"a good ascent and bad descent.\" Pilgrims have also taken this route on the way to Rome and the Vatican for centuries.\n\r\nEventually, Napoleon built a road on the old pilgrimage trail sometime in the early 19th century. In 1871, a railroad tunnel known as Frejus Tunnel was constructed some 30 miles away. The tunnel connected Mondane, France with Bardonecchia, Italy. It was one of the first tunnels of its kind and exhibited a remarkable feat of engineering for the time. Today, the tunnel is still one of the largest railroad tunnels in the world measuring some eight miles long. The road is also has been used as part of the Tour de France.\n\r\nAt the top of the pass, alongside an icy blue lake known as Lac du Mont Cenis, statues of Hannibal's elephants line the trail. The building of a dam created the artificial lake in 1921. The dam, today, feeds two hydroelectric power plants. The lake occasionally empties for maintenance. \n\r\nAt the top of the pass, as you look out over the lake, you'll find a very quirky chapel. Built in 1967, the chapel is shaped like a pyramid and is made of concrete. Today it also houses a museum about the history of this region and is one of the highest museums in Europe. Other nearby sights include a botanical garden and multiple fortifications.",

Laurel Kratochvila’s bagel journey dates back to 1897 when her great-great grandfather, Hyman Cooper, declared that he was moving to New York City for one simple reason: “The bagels are better.” Although he ended up in Boston, running a fix-it shop, his declaration set the stage for four generations of bagel devotion within the family.\n\r\nWhat began as a small addition to the English-language bookstore Shakespeare and Sons has become a destination in its own right. Laurel brought her family recipes to Berlin, recreating the authentic homemade bagels she missed from her New York roots. Her partner, Roman, who owns other bookstores in the Czech Republic and worked at the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris, complements the culinary experience with an extensive collection of English and some French books.\n\r\nBagels are hand-rolled daily in small batches. Overnight proofing, rapid boiling, and hot baking process lend to an old-fashioned flavor across varieties from poppyseed to cinnamon raisin and rosemary sea salt. A variety of homemade schmears and toppings, including sandwich options with lox and whitefish salad, keeps the bagel game interesting for a dedicated legion of regular customers.",

          "description": "As cities grow, they tend to swallow and overtake smaller towns that were once situated well outside. Often this leads to a loss of the local identity, unless the former towns fight back. Weil am Rhein did this in a very creative way by building giant chairs.\n\r\nThe town is situated just over the German border, not far from Dreiländereck, where the borders of Germany, France, and Switzerland meet. It used to be completely separate from Basel, but as both cities grew, their borders started touching more and more, to the point where many people started thinking that Weil am Rhein was the German part of Basel.\n\r\nPeople in Weil am Rhein disliked this and decided that they needed a new and separate identity from Basel. They decided that giant chairs were the key. Large chairs started appearing all over the town, not only on the ground but also on top of buildings. Most of them are made in a way that makes them climbable.\n\r\nIn the 1970s, a local artist and architect named Lassù burned chairs as an art form. He built a large concrete chair on top of a pyramid to allow for recurrent burnings.\n\r\nFurniture is a big bar of the history of Weil am Rhein. The town is home to the headquarters of the Vitra Corporation, one of the largest manufacturers of designer furniture in Europe. The company operates the Vitra Design Museum, which explores the history of furniture and interior design. Its collection includes several historically significant chairs, including Eero Saarinen's Tulip Chair, Charles and Ray Eames' iconic Lounge Chair, and many more.",

Petroglyph Beach stands out as an archaeological treasure and offers visitors a glimpse into the rich history of the region.\n\r\nSituated on the edge of the Colorado River, Petroglyph Beach is named for the numerous petroglyphs found etched into the walls of Glen Canyon. Petroglyphs are ancient rock carvings made by ancient Native Americans who inhabited the area centuries ago. These carvings depict various symbols, animals, and scenes that hold significant cultural and spiritual meaning.\n\r\nThe beach itself is a serene and tranquil spot where visitors can relax and enjoy the picturesque surroundings before continuing down the river.  Exploring Petroglyph Beach offers a unique opportunity to connect with the past and appreciate the artistic expressions of the indigenous people who once thrived in the region. The petroglyphs provide a glimpse into their daily lives, beliefs, and experiences. Visitors can spend hours examining the intricate carvings and pondering the stories they tell.\n\r\nIt's important to note that Petroglyph Beach is a protected site, and visitors are encouraged to treat it with respect and care. It is essential to avoid touching or damaging the petroglyphs to preserve them for future generations. Many sites within the National Park Service have specific guidelines and regulations in place to ensure their preservation, so it's advisable to follow any posted instructions.",

She has no priors about acts of service and what it means, but felt incredibly excited to keep at it. Why? \n\nWhat is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? \n\nOne is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. \n\nSimilarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.",

          "description": "A lot of people are saying that the indictments of Donald Trump have had the perverse effect of increasing his support among Republicans--for example, in the New York Times, Rich Lowry says \"it’s not that he’s winning despite the indictments; it’s almost as though he’s winning because of the indictments.\"  The main piece of evidence is that his lead in the polls about the Republican nomination have increased since about the time he started getting indicted (the first was on March 30).   But is that because he's become more popular, or because his leading opponent--Ron DeSantis--has become less popular?  I looked for polls asking people if they had a favorable or unfavorable view of Ron DeSantis.  The figure shows percent favorable minus percent unfavorable for all of the surveys that are available:\n\n\nIt's hard to say what was happening through mid-2022, since three surveys taken within a few days of each other in July 2022 gave very different results.  However, if we start in September 2022, there's a clear pattern--first a rise until late 2022/early 2023, and then a decline.  The fact that the recent decline has been so steady suggests that it's not the result of any single factor.  Whatever the cause, it suggests that Trump's increasing lead may be because DeSantis is getting less popular, not because Trump is getting more popular.  \n\nThese results are all from general national samples, not samples of Republicans.  I would limit it to Republicans if I could, but the breakdowns aren't available for most of the surveys.  However, it's safe to say that very few Democrats have ever had favorable views of him, so that the changes are almost entirely among Republicans and independents.   \nOf course, there are also surveys about favorable vs. unfavorable views of Trump--the reason I looked at DeSantis first is that there aren't as many about him, so it's a more manageable job.  I'll look at changes in approval of Trump in a future post.\n[Data from the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research]",

          "description": "A recent NY Times/Siena College poll finds Donald Trump with a big lead among Republicans, with 54% vs. 17% for Ron DeSantis and a combined 13% for the next five.   Does this mean that he has an unbreakable grip on the party, or just that people are familiar with Trump and not with the other candidates?  Most people don't pay much attention to politics, especially when the next election is far off.  So if someone thinks that things were pretty good when Trump was president and doesn't know much about the other possibilities, they may default to Trump.  How many people like that are there?  There's a historical example that sheds some light on this question.  In 1980, Gerald Ford didn't actively run for the nomination, but he indicated that it was a possibility and it wasn't until March 15 …",

          "description": "In my last post, I asked \" why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters on the issue [of abortion]\"? I should have said something like \"why Democratic elites haven't made more effort to appeal to moderate voters by adopting more moderate positions\"?  As I suggested in a post a few years ago, another way to appeal to moderate voters is by focusing on the negative--fears of what the extremists on the other side might do.  That's what the Democrats have done, and it's worked pretty well because many prominent Republicans have taken extreme positions.  Also, there is an asymmetry on the abortion issue--it's easier to find shocking examples of women who were denied abortions that most people will agree should have been allowed (e. g., the case that came up shortly after the Dobbs decision, a 10-year-old rape victim who had to travel out of Ohio to get an abortion) than shocking examples of women who had abortions that most people agree shouldn't have been allowed.  So if it comes down to a contest of extreme positions, the side favoring legal abortion is likely to win.",

          "description": "It's often said that \"social issues\" are more divisive than economic ones, and that increased political polarization in the United States reflects a shift from economic to social issues as the main focus of politics.  A good summary of this view is provided by William Galston, as quoted in a recent column by Thomas Edsall:  first, “The economic axis that defined our politics from the beginning of New Deal liberalism to the end of Reagan conservatism has been displaced,\" and then  \"When the core political issues are matters of right and wrong rather than more and less, compromise becomes much more difficult, and disagreement becomes more intense.

For the usual cross-sectional or longitudinal layouts this is quite standard. But for paired data, practitioners are not so used to seeing a model-based approach.\nFor paired data from a bivariate normal distribution, or for within-pair differences having a normal distribution, the paired -test is a standard procedure. BBR discussed how easy it is to get the same answer as the paired -test using either an ordinary linear model blocking on subject or using a mixed effects model with random intercepts for subjects. That BBR section also shows some examples using ordinal regression. Note that ordinal regression works as well for continuous response va…",

They were thinking of using svyrecvar, the variance estimation function that underlies most things in the package. That’s not actually the easiest approach: svyrecvar works with estimating questions, but for the kurtosis we don’t have estimating functions and instead have an explicit definition in terms of totals: \\[\\kappa = \\frac{E[(X-\\mu)^4]}{E[(X-\\mu)^2]^2}.\\] It’s likely to be easier to work with svycontrast and represent \\(\\hat\\kappa\\) as a function of estimated moments.",

          "description": "{{flipbookr}} is an R package written by Gina Reynolds. It’s very useful for teaching. It was developed for use with .Rmd files Xaringan and presently does not work with Quarto. I hacked-up a version of Flipbookr that does work with Quarto. Using it with Xaringan should be exactly the same as before. Right now it’s incomplete. I’ve just focused on getting the main user-facing function, chunk_reveal() to work. But this is also most of what the package does. Here’s a proof-of-concept Quarto presentation showing what’s working right now. You can go directly to the slides if you prefer.",

One the one hand, we pick the low hanging fruit of the easiest highest-payoff innovations to try first. On the other hand, we can more easily pursue innovation ideas when our world is richer, has better tech, and knows more.",

To cure health care, give your care-givers a clear incentive to keep you well. Make sure that when you lose, they lose, and just as much. Buy lots of life and disability insurance from your care-givers, and have a third party, unable to act against your life or health, pay you to be the beneficiary.",

Some minor things: in Definition 2.7.6 on p.93, should the general definition of the support be the set of points for which the stalk is not the *terminal* object, as opposed to the initial object? Something similar pops up in Exercise 2.7.H on the following page, where in the problem statement of part (a) we should be showing that the stalk (i_*F)_q for q outside Z is the singleton, as opposed to showing that it is the empty set, I think? Lastly, for notational consistency the adjoint pair referenced in Exercise 2.7.F on p.93 might instead be (\\alpha^{-1}, \\alpha_*), as opposed to (\\alpha^*, \\alpha_*)?",

You are also reading a section that is much simpler than before (I think/hope), so I hope you like it.  But there is also a higher chance of errors or infelicities, so please let me know if you are not happy.  \r\n\r\nThe proof of Krull's Principal Ideal Theorem is the same, and I continue to be unhappy that I have not internalized it.  But the rest has become much nicer (after I've talked with people, read some Hochster and Qing Liu and some others, and imbibed more folklore).",

I see what you mean, and it definitely could be.  The one with times maps to the one with the otimes, which maps to the right side of that map in the notes.  So we're both right.   I want to write it like this so the two vector vector bundles (the two sides of the \"\\times\") are most visible.\n\n(And thanks for your other suggestions and corrections you sent by email; I think I owe you a response, and if so, hope to get to it soon.)",

These permit you to sample a posterior pdf when you only know a function  that is related to your posterior pdf by some unknown normalization constant. Similarly, diffusion lets you sample from a pdf when you only know the gradient of . Again, you don't need the normalization.

          "description": "<div type=\"xhtml\"><div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">What is multithreading? It is the use of multiple processors to perform tasks in parallel by a single computer program. I have known this simple fact for over thirty years, but funnily enough I never explored it in practice. The reason is fundamentally that I am a physicist, not a computer scientist, and as a physicist I tend to stick with a known skillset to solve my problems, and to invest time in more physics knowledge than software wizardry. You might well say I am not a good programmer altogether, although that would secretly cause me pain. I would answer that while it is certainly true that my programs are ugly and hard to read, they do what they are supposed to do, as proven by a certain record of scientific publications. <br/><p><a href=\"https://www.science20.com/tommaso_dorigo/multithreading_for_dummies-256741\" target=\"_blank\">read more</a></p></div></div>",

For every spherical harmonic (ell and em), there are three vector spherical harmonics obtained by multiplying by the radial vector, taking the transverse gradient, and taking the transverse gradient and crossing it into the radial direction. I think these can be generalized (using, say, the Ricci calculus) to make the 2-tensors and so on. If I am right, this is a new way to represent tensor fields on the sphere.

Nesen is working on the tabulated housekeeping data, giving the position and orientation of the spacecraft and instruments in various coordinate systems (that we are trying to work out). Pacheco is working on the raw imaging data from the imaging module. We discussed how to display the imaging so that an astronomer can confirm the the noise level and rough noise properties in the pixels. We discussed adjustments to our plots of the housekeeping data to aid in our interpretation of it. In particular, we looked at some of the camera-related meta data and it looks like the camera might have a few different zoom settings. I guess we have to read some documentation!CassiniCassini",

Emulators are systems that learn the input–output relationship of a computationally expensive simulation and produce (or speed the computation of) new simulation outputs, reducing total computational requirements for a given number of simulations. These are so important now that the ESA  and  data-analysis plans crucially involve emulation.EuclidSimons Observatory\nThe issue is: How do we trust that the emulators are giving good outputs? There is no obvious way to test them, except by comparing to held-out training data. But in large-scale structure contexts, no amount of held-out data can test the enormous input data space. I don't know how we will ever trust such systems (and damn do we need to!), but I have some ideas about how to improve the situation. One involves enforcing physics symmetries on the emulators. Another involves running adversarial attacks on them.",

          "description": "All week I have been discussing with Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA) the possibility that we could find the elusive, truly zero metallicity stars in the Milky Way halo. This from an email I wrote today, reacting to the observational point that no-one has ever seen such a star:\nHow could there be absolutely ZERO zero-metallicity stars in the Milky Way? Here's everything I got:\n\nMaybe there are literally no low-mass stars ever made at zero metallicity. Absolutely none, at high precision. This is possible, given how little we know about star formation and the IMF.\nMaybe stellar evolution is so weird at zero metallicity that low-mass stars go dark by 13 Gyr. I very much doubt that this is a possibility. But maybe low-mass stars at primordial abundances never burn and just slowly collapse into white-dwarf-like condensed objects on a very long cooling timescale. They would be super cold by now, like 100 K maybe??\nMaybe low-mass stars form slower than high-mass stars in star-forming regions at zero metallicity. This permits a few of the high-mass stars to quickly evolve and explode, polluting the outsides of the just-forming low-mass stars. These low-mass stars would then have low but non-zero surface metallicities, and be very alpha-enhanced. This is possible, although would it really leave NO zero-metallicity low-mass stars behind?\nMaybe low-mass stars somehow self-pollute at formation (or later in their lives). Maybe the nuclear fusion kicks in slightly before gravitational steady-state or radiative zones are set up, and the first bit of nuclear burning gets mixed in to the stellar envelopes? These stars would appear to have non-zero (but weird, carbon-enhanced maybe?) abundances. Or maybe this happens later in life because of some weird internal mixing. I have literally no idea whether any of this is possible.",

I have many thoughts, but I will save them for later.Quaiais controversial\nAnyways, Abby Williams (NYU) has been working on making this measurement, and her dipole amplitude and direction depend on what we hold fixed and what we vary (in particular selection-function components), and they also depend on what sky region we use. None of this is surprising; the selection function has a strong dipole in it, and it is not known precisely. But then I don't understand how the studies published previously have such good error bars. Maybe they didn't consider the various different fitting regimes?",

Thus we can integrate a set of patches into a surrogate combined spectrum for one rotating star covered in convecting patches.
