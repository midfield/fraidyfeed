The prestigious football team competes in the Premier League, the highest echelon of English football. This has not always been the case however, and in 2023 the club restored a piece of its history that shines a light on Spurs’ humble beginnings.\n\r\nLegend has it that a group of schoolboys, Robert \"Bobby\" Buckle, Hamilton Casey, and John Anderson, huddled under a gaslit lamppost on Tottenham High Road one evening in 1882. Having played cricket at the Hotspurs Cricket Club, the boys, aged 13 and 14, pondered how to while away their time during the impending cricket off-season over winter. After some consideration, they decided that football would be the best solution. Their plans were soon put into action when Ca…",

          "description": "White Pocket is a unique and visually stunning geological formation located in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in northern Arizona. It is situated within the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness, a protected area known for its rugged beauty and remarkable rock formations. The closest developed town is Page, Arizona, about an hour east of the trailhead.\n\r\nWhite Pocket is characterized by its swirling and intricate patterns of white and red Navajo sandstone, which have been sculpted over millions of years by the forces of wind and water erosion. The result is a mesmerizing landscape that resembles a frozen wave or a surreal painting. The rock formations at White Pocket often feature delicate, contorted layers, creating an otherworldly and dreamlike atmosphere.\n\r\nDue to its remote location, White Pocket sees fewer visitors compared to other famous landmarks in Arizona like the Grand Canyon or Antelope Canyon. This relative seclusion adds to the appeal for those seeking a quieter and more intimate outdoor experience. \n\r\nPhotographers and nature enthusiasts are particularly drawn to White Pocket for its unique and photogenic landscapes. The intricate patterns, textures, and vibrant colors of the sandstone formations provide endless opportunities for creative compositions. It is also a popular destination for hikers and backpackers who enjoy exploring the wilderness and the surrounding area. \n\r\nAccess to White Pocket is challenging, as it is located in a remote and rugged area. The journey typically requires a four-wheel-drive vehicle and navigation skills, as the roads are unpaved and can be rough. Visitors are advised to come prepared with plenty of water, food, and fuel, as there are no facilities or services available.\n\r\nIt is highly recommended that visitors plan their trip in advance and check the official website of the Bureau of Land Management for up-to-date information.",

          "description": "In the Mayan language, Ka' Kutzal, the name of this cenote, means \"rebirth\" or \"back to life.\" An appropriate name considering its history. The only Costco store in the city of Mérida (as of early 2023) sits between what is known as the city's Industrial Zone and a residential neighborhood called Cordemex. Both of these are related to the past of the site, as a factory once stood here that manufactured fibers out of the henequén (sisal) plant, a mainstay of Yucatan's industry. The factory was owned by the Cordemex company, the world's largest sisal products manufacturer.\n\r\nWhen the factory was demolished and its floor removed, beneath a 15-centimeter layer of cement, a surprising find awaited and this natural sinkhole was rediscovered. Formed from the collapse of an underground cave, likely thousands of years ago, above a freshwater reservoir which was then exposed to the open, this cenote extends underwater in several directions into caverns and tunnels for tens of meters.\n\r\nThe \"Costco cenote,\" as the sinkhole is also known, had a garden built surrounding it in its small \"island\" in the middle of the asphalted parking lot. Considering that the Cordemex factory closed in 1991 and Costco's store wasn't opened until 2015, Ka' Kutzal's rediscovery has certainly made it worthy of the \"returned to life\" name.",

          "description": "Skyscrapers are so common nowadays that it is hard to imagine a time when they were new and trendy. But a century ago, this was very much the case. As a product of industrialization, these types of buildings became popular all over the world. As with all new things, there was skepticism and a pioneer was needed to help people get used to the idea. The Swedish architect Sven Wallander was such a man, introducing Europe to its first skyscraper. \n\r\nWhile certainly a forward-thinking man, Wallander was by no means quick. Skyscrapers were an American invention, with the first one being built in Chicago in 1885, and many more following behind it. But the first kungtorn was not built until 1924. The second followed soon after, and was completed in 1925.\n\r\nThe first tower is based on the older style of Manhattan skyscrapers in the early 1920s, many elements of which can be spotted in the design of the tower. In fact, Wallander made a study trip to the island to get inspiration for the first ever skyscraper in Europe.  \n\r\nThe second tower was designed by Ivar Callmander, who went for a more Art Nouveau style. Both towers had 17 floors and stood 60 meters high, although Callmander added one meter to his tower to have the tallest skyscraper in Europe. The two towers became immediate icons for the city and drew many tourists. It was not long after this that skyscrapers started being built in the rest of the continent.",

          "description": "Long before he wrote famous poems including \"O Captain! My Captain!\" and \"Song of Myself,\"  Walt Whitman was born on May 31, 1819, in a farmhouse in Huntington, Long Island.\n\r\nThe house was constructed by his father, who added several architectural quirks that distinguish it from others of its time—including a staircase built with every step of a different height and a penny embedded in the banister. Whitman, who was the second of nine children, lived here with his parents, older brother, and younger sister (grandma stayed over too on occasion) for the first four years of his life, before moving to Brooklyn in 1823.\n\r\nIt was in his birthplace, where his family kept a farm, that he developed his love of nature and admiration for the virtues of day-to-day labor. After Whitman's family moved out, the house passed through various tenants—some of whom respected its storied origins more than others.\n\r\nIn 1949, it was nearly sold for development before intervention from the newly founded Walt Whitman Birthplace Association, which ran a campaign across Long Island to buy the property. Nowadays, the birthplace is a museum managed by the Association and New York State.\n\r\nVisitors can get a tour of the place that birthed the father of free verse.",

          "description": "For many of us, summer conjures a patchwork quilt of memories set against blue skies and a bright, sweltering sun. Perhaps you remember trekking as a kid through a real-world version of Jurassic Park, such as Kentucky’s Dinosaur World, or venturing to a remote observatory, like the famed Tatacoa Astronomia in Villavieja, Colombia. Or maybe you remember family RV trips through America’s national parks, or stumbling across a beach covered in sea glass in Hawai‘i. Whatever summer memories come to mind, one thing’s for sure—we all remember warm July days spent exploring the unknown.\n\r\nIn these four episodes of the Atlas Obscura Podcast, host Dylan Thuras asked listeners to share their most magical summer memories. From becoming vegetarian after eating at a northern Michigan restaurant filled with taxidermied animals to walking from London to Rome following in the steps of a medieval archbishop, listen to some of the delightful stories listeners shared with us.\n\r\nMagical Summer Memories Vol. 1\n\r\n\n\r\nHear about encounters with wild bears in Michigan, filling water jugs at Mississippi’s fountain of youth, and one couple’s journey to a remote Bulgarian village to try Cherni Vit Green Cheese.\n\r\nMagical Summer Memories Vol. 2\n\r\n\n\r\nHear about one man’s trek from St Paul’s Cathedral in London to St Peter’s Cathedral in Rome, recreating the route of the 10th-century Archbishop of Canterbury, Sigeric. The 110-day journey followed the Via Francigena, an ancient pilgrimage way that Sigeric traveled more than a thousand years ago.\n\r\nMagical Summer Memories Vol. 3 - The Cardiff Giant\n\r\n\n\r\nHear a listener’s tale of a theological dispute that became a real moneymaker known to some as “Old Hoaxy.” It all started in October 1869 when workers discovered a gigantic, 10-foot-tall stone man dubbed the Cardiff Giant in New York State.\n\r\nMagical Summer Memories Vol. 4 - The Magic of Water\n\r\n\n\r\nIn this final installment of summer stories, we tackle a topic that transcends the seasons—the captivating magic of water during travel.",

          "description": "This stucco and stone exterior feels visually out of place with its colonial surroundings in Panama City's historic Casco Viejo neighborhood. The reason for this is that the church is actually from the much older city of Panama Viejo, and was transported from its ruins. \nLocated 12 kilometers away from Panama's historic city center, Panama Viejo is the oldest city established by European settlers in North America, dating back to 1519. Panama Viejo was destroyed in 1671 during an attack led by the Welsh privateer Henry Morgan. The population elected to move to the peninsula—the site of the present-day Casco Viejo—to be better fortified from attack.\n\r\nLa Iglesia de la Merced was built in the early 1600s by Franciscan monks. They transported the church brick-by-brick to the new location (until they ran out of funds) and completed the project with wood. The first mass was offered on the day of Panama City's inauguration in 1673.\n\r\nUnlike other colonial churches, the interior is upheld by a wooden ceiling and the mixture of surfaces is an architectural delight. Additionally, the site is known for its mosaic work, which lines the address along the sidewalk. This dates back to 1732.\n\r\nThe church also boasts the statue of 13th-century saint Maria de la Cervello. After she had died, she would sail on the wings of the wind to rescue ships who were at risk of shipwreck.",

Although Whitman only lived in the house where was he born for the first four years of his life, he frequently returned to the area, where his family had roots for more than a century.\n\r\nOn his visits, he enjoyed wandering the grounds of what is now the park, climbing up to what is the highest peak on Long Island—at a whopping 400 feet in elevation. (Hey, nobody said Long Island was known for its hills.)\n\r\nNowadays, the top is marked by a sturdy rock emblazoned with Whitman's poem, \"Paumanok,\" the Algonquian name for Long Island. At its base, you can also usually find an assortment of smaller painted rocks left by fellow travelers on the trail.",

The hot burst of bitter liquid drew an invisible line connecting everyone in that gray, somber space.\n\r\nMate is a caffeinated, tea-like infusion made from the dried leaves of the yerba mate plant. Often drunk hot, mate has an intense, earthy taste—think grass, smoke, and soil. The practice of drinking from a shared straw in ronda (in a circle) has been bringing people in Argentina together for centuries.\n\r\nFirst introduced to the Jesuits by the indigenous Guaraní people during the colonial period, mate has been part of Argentina…",

It served as the main Buddhist temple here until the communist era when religion was suppressed and most Buddhist temples in Mongolia were destroyed.\n\r\nThe monastery was originally established in the early 19th century outside of Khüree (now known as  Ulaanbaatar). Its name translates as ”the great place of complete joy.” The monastery complex is made up of a number of shrines, temples, and assembly halls.\n\r\nGandan was closed in 1939 during the anti-religious persecutions in Mongolia, and many of its buildings were razed. In 1944, the monastery was reopened, and for nearly 50 years it was the only active monastery in the country.\n\r\nSince the 1990s, Gandan has been rehabilitated in stature and reopened to worshippers. After much recent renovation, it is worth visiting to experience the current role of Buddhism in Mongolia. The addition of the Batsagaan Grand Assembly Hall adjacent to the main temple adds to the grandeur of the complex.\n\r\nInside the main temple stands Avalokitesvara, the tallest indoor standing Buddha statue in the world at 26 meters (85 feet). Walk clockwise to see the hundreds of smaller statues that surround the temple interior.",

However, in 1960, the lads were still mediocre, unknown teen performers struggling to get gigs in their hometown of Liverpool. So when offered a residency at a small club in Hamburg's red light district, they decided to try their luck.\n\r\nLife for the mop tops in the German port city was wild and crazy, but far from glamorous. They slept in cramped, smelly storerooms and had to play for hours and hours on end for peanuts. The long and grueling sets gave the young Liverpudlians the experience and the professional skills they needed though. When returning home to England in 1962, the beginner musicians had transformed into accomplished soon-to-be pop stars—or as John Lennon once famously said: \"I might have been born in Liverpool, but I grew up in Hamburg\"\n\r\nBeatles-Platz opened in 2008 and celebrates the fact that Hamburg was the Fab Four's springboard to global stardom. The small square is shaped like a vinyl record with a diameter of 29 meters (95 feet). Famous Beatles song titles are engraved in the stonework and the place is adorned with life-sized, metal silhouettes (which almost look like giant cookie cutters) of the members.\n\r\nThe plaza is located at the crossroads of the Reeperbahn boulevard and the Grosse Freiheit side street in Hamburg's seedy St. Pauli area—just a few steps from the venues where John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr once got their start.",

          "description": "Situated in the heart of Australia's Pilbara region at the mouth of the Harding River is the small historic town of Cossack. This once-abandoned area is steeped in history and in recent years the town's buildings have been restored to allow visitors to step back in time. The history first started with the Ngarluma people, the local Aboriginal people who occupied the land for hunting and fishing for thousands of years.\n\r\nIn 1863, a British-born Australian pioneer named Walter Padbury landed his ship, Tien Tsin, near Cossack. Over the next few eyars, many others followed to settle was the first port in northern West Australia. The area was initially used for pastoral farming which led to the development of infrastructure.\n\r\nCossack was one of the key sites for the booming pearling industry across the region in the 1800s. Historic records indicate that in the early 1870s, there were up to 80 pear luggers operating in the region. This led to an influx of Japanese, Chinese, and Malay people who migrated to work in the arduous conditions of the industry.\n\r\nThe following years saw many workers and ships involved in pearling move to Broome and alongside the decline of the gold rush, this led to the population of Cossack rapidly declining. In the 1940s, the last residents left, leaving the stone buildings to fall into a state of disrepair.\n\r\nIn 2007, a decision was made to restore the buildings to their former glory, and the town is now a designated museum town. Visitors can walk around and venture inside the restored structures, including the bakehouse, the courthouse, and the historic post office.",

          "description": "Pi is an irrational number with an infinite amount of decimals. While 3.14 is good enough for high school students and most engineers often use 4.0 just to be sure, there are actually a lot of uses for the rest of the decimals, primarily in cryptography. These days we know pi down to tens of trillions of decimals, but not too long ago calculating a few dozen could literally take a lifetime. \n\r\nMany people in history spent years of their lives calculating a few decimals of pi, using a method where a circle can be approximated by a many-sided polygon that can have millions of sides, becoming closer to closer to a circle. The last person to use this method is the 16th-century mathematician Ludulph van Ceulen who spent 25 years working on the problem, coming up with a polygon that had 0.5 billion sides and calculating its circumference to calculate pi to within 20 decimals and later expanding to 35.\n\r\nThis number was considered his life's work and gave him great renown, especially because this level of detail was more than enough for any practical use. The number is also dubbed the Ludolphine number in his honor. 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288\n\r\nNot long after this, in 1666, Isaac Newton found a new method of calculating pi that can be done in arbitrary precision, making the old method that Van Ceulen used obsolete. Fortunately, he did not live to see this.\n\r\nAfter his death in 1610, this number was placed on his grave in the Pieterskerk in Leiden. The gravestone was lost over the years but restored in 2000. The monument can still be seen today, bearing the following roughly translated text: \"Here lies buried Mr. Ludolph van Ceulen, professor in mathematics. Born on the 28th of January 1540, died on the 31st of December 1610. During his life, with lots of effort, he found that with a diameter of 1, the circumference is between 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288 and 3.14159265358979323846264338327950289\"",

The Governor, while shifting from Mumbai to Pune for the monsoon, used to bring along the entire entourage which consisted of staff, furniture, utensils, food, and other paraphernalia. \n\r\nA short distance away from the main building (which was the Governor’s Bungalow), was the kitchen. Today, the building where the kitchen used to be, is called Potdar Sankul. \n\r\nFrom the kitchen to the main building, there exists an underground tunnel. This 300-foot-long tunnel was used by the staff and servants to transport food from the kitchen to the dining room in the main building.\n\r\nAlong the length of the tunnel run pipes for hot water and cold water. At the end of the tunnel is a wooden staircase that goes up into the main building. At the base of the stairs is a pantry, where expensive cutlery was kept. Next to the pantry, under the stairs, is a room where the butler used to sleep. Along the tunnel’s ceiling, at regular intervals, are openings for ventilation. \n\r\nThe main building was built between 1864 to 1871 and the tunnel was built during the same period. The tunnel was nonoperational for many years. Recently, it has been refurbished, whitewashed, and lit with retro-style lightbulbs. \n\r\nThe tunnel is accessible to the public by means of a guided heritage walk conducted by the university authorities.",

The town remained habited until the early 2000s when people started to get sick. In 2012, the residents were forced to leave when E. coli was found in the drinking water.\n\r\nIt remained abandoned for a few years until a history teacher bought the property with plans of renovating the town into a living history museum. Unfortunately, those plans never came to fruition and the town was repurchased in mid-2022.\n\r\nToday, while the village remains semi-abandoned, the new owners allow tours and host open houses for a small fee.

          "description": "Kubur Kassim graveyard dates back to the early 19th century and has served as a burial ground for generations of Muslims in Singapore. The cemetery has witnessed the interment of individuals from various backgrounds, including early settlers, pioneers, and notable figures from the Muslim community.\n\r\nThe graveyard is a serene and solemn place, marked by rows of simple gravestones adorned with traditional Islamic inscriptions. The vegetation is also very flourishing and wild there, with big trees all around.\n\r\nHowever, it is worth noting that the Kubur Kassim Cemetery also carries intriguing legends and superstitions that have captured the imagination of many. Situated in the neighborhood of Siglap, which translates to \"dark one\" in Malay, the cemetery has acquired a reputation for mysterious occurrences. It is said that the area earned its name after a peculiar eclipse event that took place in 1821. These tales have contributed to the cemetery's allure and the prevalence of ghost stories and urban legends associated with it.\n\r\nLegends persist of supernatural beings haunting the grounds, such as the Pocong and Pontianak. The cemetery's mystical ambiance supposedly even inspired the 1957 Malay film Pontianak, with some scenes shot in nearby areas.\n\r\nWhat makes the Kubur Kassim Cemetery even more intriguing are the tales surrounding the Orang Bunian, mythological humanoid beings believed to dwell hidden from human sight. According to local lore, dedicated tombs honoring the Orang Bunian are said to exist within the cemetery, awaiting those with a keen eye and patient exploration.\n\r\nThese legends and stories add an extra layer of fascination to the historical and cultural significance of the Kubur Kassim graveyard. It continues to be a site where the past converges with myth, capturing the imagination and curiosity of those who venture into its hallowed grounds.",

          "description": "Gregory Natural Bridge is a natural sandstone bridge in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that was covered by Lake Powell filling up since Glen Canyon Dam's completion in 1966. The 137-foot arch was last seen in 1969 but has recently resurfaced with declining lake levels.\n\r\nLake Powell hit its lowest water level in 2023 since being filled in 1980. The declining water levels have revealed other hidden treasures like Cathedral in the Desert.\n\r\nThe arch was formed by thousands of years of erosion. Erosion causes certain sections of the sandstone to become more vulnerable to weathering, while others remain relatively intact. As water seeps into cracks and freezes in cold climates, the rock expands and leads to the widening of gaps and fractures. Eventually, an arch-shaped opening is formed.",

Although the aesthetic loss is regrettable, the plant has provided clean and sustainable energy for almost a century.\n\r\nThe north channel is now effectively a spillway.

They flow out into a playa (dry lake bed) in Coal Valley.\n\r\nWater Gap was the site of an improbable (and ephemeral) agricultural development project around the turn of the last century. The Cherry Creek Irrigation Company built a dam at Water Gap and platted a townsite, Oneota, with the idea that the stored water could irrigate crops. Unfortunately, the dam quickly washed out and the whole project had to be abandoned. Remains of the dam are said to be visible, but it's pretty much gone now. In fact, erosion has now incised a channel about 10 feet deep through the middle of the gap.\n\r\nThe area now lies completely within the Basin and Range National Monument, so anything that is left is protected.

Sheep raising increased in importance by the beginning of the 20th century, and provided opportunities for Basque sheepherders who came to the West in substantial numbers. Hailing from the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain, these people, who speak a language unrelated to any other, were renowned for their expertise in sheep husbandry.\n\r\nA sheep camp was established here by the Basques in the early 20th century, and in the early 1950s, the present structures were built. They include a bunkhouse, a storehouse, and a bread oven, the latter built as a separate free-standing masonry structure. Such ovens were common in the Basque community.\n\r\nThe site now lies within the Granite Chief Wilderness Area, which was designated in 1984, and the buildings were initially slated for demolition as inappropriate in the wilderness. Fortunately, the camp was then designated as a historic site, and the structures are now preserved on that basis. Indeed, they were restored in the early 2000s.

          "description": "Rainbow Bridge National Monument is a spectacular natural bridge located in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The bridge was formed by continuous erosion from wind, water, and time, gradually shaping the rock into its current striking form. The formation is one of the largest natural bridges in the world. It spans an impressive 290 feet across and reaches a height of 275 feet.\n\r\nRainbow Bridge was designated as a National Monument in 1910 by President William Howard Taft, making it one of the earliest protected areas in the United States and is managed by the National Park Service.\n\r\nVisitors can reach Rainbow Bridge by boat on Lake Powell. The journey provides scenic views of the surrounding red rock canyons and the vast expanse of the lake. Alternatively, hikers can access Rainbow Bridge by two trails starting near Navajo Mountain. Both trails are rated strenuous.",

However, just across the street from this location stands a house once home to President Truman for a short time. The memorial was built in 2005 under the leadership of the Hiroshima-Platz e.V. association led by Hideto Sotobayashi, an eye whiteness to the bombing.  \n\r\nThe piece was built under the purvey of the sculptor Makoto Fujiwara, who supervised the building of the monument by exchange students from the affected cities and local students. \n\r\nThe text reads: \"In memory of the victims of the atomic bombing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and August 9, 1945, During the Potsdam Conference of the Allied Great Powers from July 17 to August 2, 1945, the then President of the United States of America, Harry S.

The area also has the advantage of an existing, well-developed transmission line infrastructure, due to the many large hydropower plants on the Columbia River system. For these reasons, the construction of wind-generating plants has boomed in the area over the last couple of decades.\n\r\nThe Wild Horse Wind Farm is an excellent example of one of these facilities, as it also includes a visitor center on renewable energy, many publicly available displays, and even guided tours. It is run by Puget Sound Energy, the utility for most of Washington.\n\r\nThe Wild Horse Wind Farm is located on Whiskey Dick Mountain northeast of Ellensburg. The first phase was completed in 2006, with an expansion following in 2009. It currently consists of 149 turbines, with a nameplate capacity of 273 megawatts. There is also a 500-kilowatt solar array, one of the largest in the state\n\r\nWhiskey Dick Mountain also hosts a large resident elk herd, and sightings of elk while visiting the turbines are practically guaranteed.",

In 2019, Ross Welbon, a beer brewer and beekeeper, and Dru Sousan, a bartender with a long history in the local restaurant scene, opened up Nashville’s first meadery.\n\r\nAll of the meads here come from Honeytree Meadery’s own apiary, which is spread across two locations holding more than 30 bee colonies. Each glass contains notes of the honey used to produce it—from a milder wildflower to fragrant orange blossom—while some contain custom infusions of aromatics such as fresh ginger or pineapple and sage. Welbon, ever the IPA-enthusiast, adds his own flair with a dry-hopped variation.\n\r\nAs a bonus, the meadery has one of the best backyard patios in town, complete with a roaring fire and beeswax artworks by Randy Purcell. It’s the perfect spot to kick back with an order of tacos from Alebrije, the truck perpetually parked outside. Named for a Mexican cryptid, the business is the creation of chef Edgar Victoria, who hails from Mexico City. Victoria sources masa from small-scale producers for his tlayudas, huaraches, and tortillas. Check their Instagram to keep an eye out for specials, like tamales made with blue conico corn masa.",

The crowd is a mix of crusty old-timers, twentysomethings downing PBRs, and warmly welcomed travelers. \n\r\nOn any given night, half the room is probably in a band—a fact that comes in handy when it’s karaoke time. Expect to hear some killer country music covers, all without paying a cover charge. If you plan on taking your turn at the mic, know that Santa takes the stage rules seriously: “No Beer, No Cussin', and No Cigarettes on Santa's stage!” Sing a song that’s too vulgar and expect to be booted off.",

          "description": "Perched at what feels like the gateway to East Nashville, this diminutive house of pain provides hot chicken–seekers with a spice challenge they won't soon forget. The interior is simple, with nostalgic flare and additional seating out back. The menu is equally spartan, sticking to a succinct list of bone-in poultry parts, along with both catfish and whiting filets, all flawlessly seasoned and fried to an audible crunch. \n\r\nWhile Nashville has no shortage of restaurants serving excellent renditions of its famous chicken, Bolton's has a particularly storied legacy. Bolton Matthews, who co-founded the restaurant with his wife Dolly in 1997, was the nephew of hot chicken legend Bolton Polk, who worked his way up through the kitchens at Prince's Hot Chicken Shack. Before he passed away, Polk left his secret recipe to Matthews.\n\r\nIn an oral history interview with Southern Foodways Alliance, Dolly said of customers demanding their chicken, “They were banging on the door... Says it gives them a rush. They can breathe better. They can function better at work because they’re more alert.” \n\r\nIt’s easy to see how one bite will wake you up. A word to the wise: imagine spice levels here running large. As in, mild is really medium—so on and so forth. Don't try to be a hero when you order or you'll end up crying in front of every diner in the restaurant.",

One especially large cardboard cutout, a gift from local artist Brett Douglas Hunter, has been repeatedly stolen and returned with great drama to the bar.\n\r\nDino’s, which has been serving cheap beers and bourbons until the hazy late-late hours of the night since the 1970s, feels like a timewarp, even if it’s had a few subtle, behind-the scenes touch-ups over years. \n\r\nIn 2015, Nashville restaurant duo Miranda Whitcomb Pontes and Alex Wendkos stepped in to run the joint. Luckily, the pair knew what made Dino’s so special in the first place and chose not to mess with it too much. The vibes remain impeccable and the cheeseburger is as good as when Anthony Bourdain dug it. Order yours “Animal Style,” with plenty of mustard, pickles, sauce, and onions, plus a fried egg or bacon, if you’re feeling it. Don’t skip the fries.\n\r\n\nLike any great dive, Dino’s hits best long after its competition calls it a night. Come hang with other East Nashville industry types getting off their shifts until 3 a.m. seven nights a week. Or if you prefer to drink under the harsh light of day, stop by Dolly’s Lemonade Stand, a giant lemon crowned by a sculptural rendition of the country diva, that serves as a satellite bar Thursday through Saturday. \n\r\nIn 2022, not long after her namesake lemonade stand opened, Parton herself swung by.

With new financial backing, it re-opened and ran from 1869 to 1871, with some desultory activity thereafter, but as was so often the case the grade and volume of ore was inadequate to repay the investment.\n\r\nThe most prominent remnant is the chimney for the smelter, but there are fragments of other ruins in the vicinity.

But if you look closely, you will see people, not roller coaster cars, traversing the tracks in this park. In fact, Pohang's Space Walk was designed to be enjoyed on foot.\n\r\nKorea's largest walkable art installation began development in 2019 by Pohang's city government in partnership with two German artists, Heiki Mutter and Ulrich Genth. Visitors brave enough to traverse the 717 steps will be treated to spectacular views of Youngil Bay and Youngildae Beach.\n\r\nBut Pohang's seaside location is not the only feature that makes it the perfect home for the Space Walk. POSCO, Korea's largest steel manufacturer, is headquartered in Pohang, where the 317 tons of steel used in this art piece were produced. The Space Walk is expected to become a permanent feature of Pohang's skyline as a special nod to the impressive steel manufacturing that takes place in the city.",

It was built in 1978 and is dedicated to the message of Fatima, reportedly delivered directly from the Mother of God to three Portuguese children in 1917.\n\r\nThe Blue Army was founded in 1946 by Harold Colgan, a parish priest of St Mary in Plainfield, New Jersey. Colgan had fallen critically ill and was hospitalized. In the hospital, he prayed to Our Lady of Fatima that if she cured him, he would spend the rest of his life spreading devotion to her. Colgan recovered and began preaching about the Virgin Mary shortly after.\n\r\nTowering 130 feet above the shrine is a bronze statue of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, with the roof representing her mantle flowing over and protecting her children. Sister Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, the last survivor of the original three children that the vision of Our Lady of Fatima was brought in as a consultant on the shrine.\n\r\nThere are many bronze statues dotting the grounds.

          "description": "“Đi ăn nhậu tối nay không?” is a phrase you’ll hear often throughout Vietnam. In literal terms, it translates to “let’s go eat and drink tonight,” but the use of the word nhậu evokes something deeper. To nhậu is to come together over plentiful food, typically eaten with your hands, and drink, typically generous amounts of beer. It’s the quintessential act of daily celebration, for no reason at all, that often lasts for hours and sometimes includes spontaneous sidewalk karaoke. \n\r\nThis is the ritual on display at Nhớ Tuyết, which literally means “missing or remembering snow,” though it’s really named after the owner, whose name is Tuyết. Come as the locals do: with a big group of friends. And enjoy a vast selection of seafood ranging from clams in lemongrass broth, to scallops topped with scallion oil and crushed peanuts, to colossal river prawns all cooked via your preferred preparation, whether that’s salt-toasted or tossed in a wok with tamarind sauce. \n\r\nBeyond the seafood, Ms. Tuyết is known for her proprietary recipe for pâté, which comes in a thinner-than-usual texture with a sheet of burnt rice for scooping up as sort of a dip. There are also plenty of options for vegetarian diners, including an off-menu tofu in salted egg sauce. Your meal here will typically come with a full case of beer. At the end of the meal, they’ll count how many cans are left and charge accordingly.",

From this pot, brimming with seafood and herbs, the shop’s owner, Mrs. Mai Thi Lien, ladles each bowl to order. \n\r\nA four-decade-old mainstay located near the bustling Ben Thanh Market, the restaurant’s namesake noodle soup, bún riêu, combines rice vermicelli noodles, or bún, with riêu, or a crab paste which is typically combined with pork, shrimp, and prawns to create a solid, meatloaf-like consistency. Also in the bowl are heaping chunks of tofu as well as huyet, or coagulated pork blood, while a side plate of herbs includes perilla leaves and basil. \n\r\nThough the dish is believed to have originated in northern Vietnam, it’s become one of the most popular noodle soups throughout the entire country. Here, Mrs. Lien serves her bún riêu with an accompanying dipping cup of tamarind fish sauce with sliced chili and pure shrimp paste. The use of tamarind is distinctly southern: twirl up the noodles with a piece of crab paste and dip it all into the sauce for a pop of tangy brightness.",

          "description": "While Vietnamese food debates usually revolve around whose pho is best, there’s also a fair amount of polarizing discourse surrounding cơm tấm, or broken rice, as everyone feels strongly about their favorite rendition. \n\r\nPerhaps best described as an everyday meal of the people, this culturally significant dish is centered around its most humble ingredient, the rice. During the brutal French colonial period, a time of hunger in Vietnamese history, people began cooking with the rice that had been broken during the milling process. As such, it’s become a symbol of Vietnamese resilience and resourcefulness. \n\r\nThis is the origin of cơm tấm, which is the namesake dish at Cơm Tấm Nguyễn Văn Cừ, a beloved institution that’s been selling it since 1968. The rendition here is traditional: a couple scoops of the broken rice along with sides of sườn nướng (marinated pork chop), bì (shredded pork skin), chả trứng (egg and meat loaf) along with pickled vegetables. Fish sauce, with or without birdseye chili, is poured over the top and adds depth of flavor. \n\r\nThe big differentiator here is the larger-than-typical size of pork chop, which is prepared on the grill out in front of the nondescript storefront. It comes with a higher price tag (a little less than $7), of course, and while that’s earned it some detractors, it nevertheless remains packed for lunch daily with a mostly local audience.",

Known as a hanok, the home was first constructed in 1899. The wealthy landowner, Jeong Nak-Gyo, and his family commissioned the house and were the first to live in it. \n\r\nThroughout the Japanese colonial period in South Korea from 1910-1945, many similar homes with Korean architecture were destroyed. This house adopted a Japanese-style garden during this time period but was able to maintain its distinctive Korean buildings.\n\r\nThe home was later purchased by its most famous resident, Lee Jang-Woo, in 1959. Lee was a prominent philanthropist and education advocate for the Jeolla region. Along with his legacy of founding kindergartens, middle schools, high schools, and universities across Jeolla, he has also left behind this remarkable architectural site for visitors today to enjoy. Under Lee's care, additions were made to the house including men's quarters, servants' quarters, and a storehouse, all in keeping with the traditional Korean style.\n\r\nThe Japanese-style garden was converted back to a Korean-style garden in 2009 for the Gwangju Design Biennale. The original women's quarters and gates built by Nak-Gyo are also still intact.",

Opened in 2017, it’s the brainchild of chef Peter Cuong Franklin, a chef-auteur who traded in a career in investment banking for life in a kitchen, earning acclaim at Hong Kong’s Chôm Chôm before moving back to Vietnam, a country he once fled as a young refugee. \n\r\nFranklin calls his cooking “new Vietnamese” cuisine, riffing off the “new American” and “new Scandinavian” food movements that have taken off in the west. At Ănăn—Ho Chi Minh City’s first Michelin star restaurant—his freewheeling approach is evident in dishes like the Da Lat Pizza, a twist on an open-faced rice paper street food from Franklin’s hometown of Da Lat, and the Banh Xeo Taco with beef, reimagining Vietnamese crispy crepes in a hand-held format with meat cooked in Vietnamese bo kho (beef stew) seasoning. \n\r\nThere’s more to love than just the food. The restaurant spreads out across five levels of seating including a charming rooftop deck offering sweeping views of the District 1 neighborhood. Located on the third floor, the on-site cocktail bar Nhau Nhau (“drink, drink”) turns out specialty drinks like a Phojito—a mojito infused with classic pho spices like star anise and cinnamon.",

A product of French colonialism, coffee is widely consumed by Vietnamese people, who congregate at the dozens of cafes on every city corner to re-energize, reconnect, and take respite from the heat. It’s a part of Vietnamese culture to take one’s time over coffee, which is brewed via a single-serving, slow-drip metal filter called a phin. \n\r\nA small roaster with two locations in Saigon (one in District 1 and one in District 2), Hue Cafe offers all the classic styles of Vietnamese coffee: black, with condensed milk, blended with coconut and ice. But the standout is salt coffee, a specialty from the cafe’s namesake, Hue, the former imperial capital located in central Vietnam. The drink involves whipping cream into a salty fluff to accentuate the natural sweetness of the coffee. \n\r\nSimple pleasure and relaxation is the essence of Hue Cafe, whose best location is on the shady, tree-lined strip of Xuân Thủy in the expat area of District 2. Order your coffee and enjoy it outside where all the regulars gather around on plastic stools and watch the bikes go by.",

Located in São Paulo, it is 105 meters tall.\n\r\nConstruction began in 1924, and was completed in 1929. At the time of its opening, it was the tallest building in Latin America, and the largest concrete-framed building in the world. Although today it seems modest when compared to other huge buildings in the capital, the building designed by Italian businessman Giuseppe Martinelli carries with it tons of history and various curiosities.\n\r\nThe news of the construction of the tallest building in the city brought terror to the people of São Paulo at the time. Still accustomed to smaller buildings, with up to four floors, residents of the region feared that the construction…",

You could honestly spend days peering at these tiny worlds, seeing new things every time you look. There are hidden bits and little jokes in every display. It's extremely kid friendly, they even have several interactive setups specifically for children to operate. They also have a party room where they host birthday parties.\n\r\nSpeaking of setups to operate, getting to play with the trains is not just for kids. They have dozens of spots where you can interact with the displays and even operate the trains themselves. There is an in-house repair shop and watching volunteers repair the trains is as interesting as the displays themselves.\n\r\nThe volunteers are so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the various displays and will take you all around pointing things out and telling you about the history of the place and the trains.

Some early practitioners were proven as frauds, but the movement grew in the American Northeast. Records of meetings officially begin in 1876 but the camp’s history dates back to the 1840s. By 1876 spiritualists would arrive every summer for meetings and lectures from the leading thinkers of the day, with an entry fee of ten cents a day. The camp was born as some attendees put down firmer roots. The peak of the camp was in the early 1900s, with more than 130 cottages, with thousands attending summer camp activities. \n\r\nThe Etna Spiritualist Association was born in September 1919. The camp also was involved early in the women’s rights/feminist movement, with female camp members visible in many issues.\n\r\nProminent visitors have included Harrison D. Barrett, the first president of the U.S. National Spiritualist Association, and U.S. Senator Margaret Chase Smith. The camp was given a Maine Governor’s Day proclamation in 1911. \n\r\nIn the camp, there is a large memorial stone for Mary S. Vanderbilt, who died in 1911. Her grave and headstone are in Barrett Square. Mary Drake Jenne worked with them from 1902 until Harrison passed to spirit in 1911 and Mary Vanderbilt in 1919. Mary Drake Jenne continued to be a worker for Spiritualism until her death in 1946.\n\r\nVisitors are welcome to park, explore, and even take the short downhill walk to Etna Pond to the north. There are many cottages throughout the camp, approximately 50, in various states of repair, centered around the camp green. \n\r\nIf interested in more on Camp Etna, see Mira Ptacin’s 2019 The In-Betweens: The Spiritualists, Medums, and Legends of Camp Etna.",

          "description": "On any given day, visitors to the Tower of London can vary from several hundred to well into the thousands. Many come seeking to get a glimpse of the Crown Jewels or perhaps they desire to witness the location of where executions took place firsthand. What the latter may not be aware of, is the vast majority of public executions took place outside the walls of the tower, just a few yards away, on a grassy knoll near Tower Hill Underground Station.\n\r\nLess than two dozen individuals met their maker at the end of the executioner's axe on Tower Green. These included the two wives of King Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and Catherine Howard, as well as Lady Jane Grey, who was Queen of England for only nine days. As compared to the estimated 125 mortals who lost their lives across the road on Tower Hill. The disparity in numbers is because executions at the Tower of London were reserved for individuals of high rank or who possessed popular support.\n\r\nAt the western edge of a green space known as Trinity Square Gardens, a scaffold was erected from the 15th century to dispatch of individuals who held an air of status and were found guilty of high treason or other offenses against the crown. It operated for nearly four hundred years, with the last public execution taking place in 1747, that of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, a supporter of the Stuart family's right to the throne.\n\r\nToday, visitors can find a small cordoned-off area, just to the left of the Grade I-listed Merchant Navy Memorial, First World War Section. Here, you'll find a list of names, beginning in 1381 and ending in the mid-1700s. These include participants in the following rebellions: Peasants' Revolt, War of the Roses, English Reformation, as well as the Jacobite Uprising. Thousands of eager onlookers would gather to witness these public displays of execution.",

          "description": "Magnesium-bearing deposits (magnesite, or magnesium carbonate, and brucite, or magnesium hydroxide) were discovered here in the late 1920s. The minerals are used in making refractory (high-temperature) ceramics and in chemical manufacturing, notably Epsom salts. It was a quiet niche market.\n\r\nThen came World War II. High-performance aircraft were critical to the war effort, and magnesium was a key component of light, high-strength aircraft alloys. It was feared that the Axis powers were way ahead in magnesium technology. Hence a crash program for magnesium production was initiated, and it used these magnesium minerals as ore.\n\r\nThe raw ore minerals were shipped to a newly opened plant in Henderson, Nevada, just outside Las Vegas, for processing into magnesium metal. Hydropower was available from the newly-finished Hoover Dam, as the electrolytic process for magnesium separation requires a great deal of electricity. It's analogous to aluminum in that respect.\n\r\nThe shipping route was very circuitous as there was no direct rail link. The ore was first trucked to a railhead at Luning, Nevada, some 32 miles west (the rails have since been torn up). It then went north to the transcontinental route outside Reno, eastward to Salt Lake City, and finally southwest to Las Vegas on the rail link to Los Angeles.\n\r\nBy 1944 enough magnesium metal—more than 80,000 tons—had been made for the wartime demand. The mine has continued producing magnesite and some brucite ever since, however, for those other applications, and is now the only producer in the United States. It is also said to be the oldest continuously operating mine in Nevada.",

The thinker and writer gained notoriety throughout the early 19th century for proclaiming what were, at the time, radical notions: he questioned the cult of industrial labor, espoused socialist ideals, and coined the term \"feminism.\" One of his less radical views—again, given the time—framed Jews as regressive and uncivilized.

          "description": "The city of Kupferberg ('Copper Mountain'), renamed 'Miedzianka' when the territory passed from Germany to Poland after World War II, was one of many prosperous mining towns in the mountains of Lower Silesia. As the name indicates, it was originally copper that was mined in this area—until the Soviets discovered after their occupation in 1945 that the local mines were also a rich source of uranium.\n\r\nThe Soviets quickly fenced off the area with barbed wire and forced local Poles to work in the uranium mines with no knowledge of the actual dangers. Officially, it was called a \"paper factory,\" and miners suffering from radiation poisoning were formally ignored. Anyone who attempted to reveal the true nature of the mines near Miedzianka was promptly 'disappeared' by the Communist government and never seen again.\n\r\nAfter about 600 tonnes of uranium were shipped from Miedzianka to the Soviet Union, the local mine was considered to be exhausted, and the extensive tunneling underneath the town had left the ground unstable. The town itself was then torn down in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and most of the residents were forcibly resettled to the nearby city of Jelenia Góra.\n\r\nToday, Miedzianka only exists in the form of a few scattered buildings, a church, and a resurrected form of its once-famous brewery along one surviving mountain road. The surrounding fields and forests are filled with the overgrown ruins of houses, factories, and cemeteries that used to form part of the city. Information boards on what was formerly the main square tell the story, accompanied by numerous photos, of what was once the bustling city center of Kupferberg/Miedzianka, now almost completely forgotten to the passage of time.",

It was conceived as a personal whim of the king who saved Retiro Park. The house was destined to offer his majesty a place to rest and is located on the central island of a pond where, back in the day, you could even fish.\n\r\nAfter the War of Independence, the park was badly damaged and was rebuilt by King Fernando VII. During this Renaissance, exotic and beautiful constructions such as the Persian Hall and Fisherman's House were created. Isidro González Velázquez designed this house and surrounded it with a pond for anglers to enjoy. The house has a striking pinkish body, adorned with Pompeian-style paintings and frescoes and with niches, where Roman busts once stood.\n\r\nThis type of construction had its predecessors in the so-called 18th-century pavilions that were prominent in English and French gardens. In Spain, these curious structures appeared in important gardens at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century.\n\r\nFor years, the Fisherman's House remained abandoned and was eventually used as a Tourist Information Office. It is now the Municipal Center for the Adoption of Pets.",

          "description": "The modern Polish city of Kostrzyn nad Odrą lies directly on the Oder river, which has formed the border between Poland and Germany since World War II. Prior to 1945, the city was mostly inhabited by ethnic Germans and called \"Küstrin\" (also listed in some places as \"Cüstrin\"), but the German residents were forced to leave as a result of the border changes after the war. Ethnic Poles settled in their place, although not in the strictest geographical sense: the historical city centre of Kostrzyn/Küstrin was so throughly destroyed in the war that it had become uninhabitable, so the incoming Poles built what amounted to a new city center about 1 km (0.6 miles) to the northeast.\n\r\nThe historical city center, once a densely-populated, fortified settlement on the Oder River, was left to fall into ruin, and was eventually torn down entirely. Today, the historical center is a free public park that has been largely reclaimed by nature. The foundations and cellars of the pre-war buildings are still visible, the main sights (like the church, city hall, and market square) are all labeled, and the original streets are still signposted, as if directing tourists around a ghostly city that still exists among the ruins.\n\r\nThere is a small, free museum near the former city center's entrance (next to the old border crossing) as well as a larger paid, seasonal museum in the \"Filip Bastion\", one of the surviving fortifications on the eastern edge of the former city center. There are few restrictions in the park and it's possible to explore the city ruins to your heart's content.",

          "description": "The Japanese idiom nureginu has been in continuous use since the Heian period (794-1185) and means \"false accusation\" or \"frame-up,\" while its literal definition is \"wet clothes.\" Though the word is frequently used today, its etymology remains rather obscure even to native Japanese speakers. Still, it is no doubt an idiom suggesting the existence of some sort of story behind its origin.\n\r\nLegend has it that, during the reign of Emperor Shōmu (724-749), a nobleman named Chikayo Sano was appointed as the governor of Chikuzen Province (today Fukuoka) and came from Kyoto to Hakata, bringing his daughter Haruhime and his second wife. Envious of her stepdaughter's beauty, Sano's wife decided to frame her up and ruin her life. She bribed the local fisherman and bought his still-wet kimono, then hung it up in Haruhime's room.\n\r\nWhen Sano came back home that night, his wife told him that Haruhime has stolen the fisherman's kimono—or, according to a variation of the story, is having an affair with him—and upon seeing the wet kimono in her room, Sano became furious and killed her in her sleep. A year later, the ghost of Haruhime appeared in Sano's dreams, claiming her innocence. Realizing his irreversible mistake, Sano turned his back on the world and spent the rest of his life as a monk.\n\r\nToday, on the site of the Nureginu-zuka or the \"Tomb of the Wet Kimono\" stands a basalt stele, with three Sanskrit letters and the date 1344 inscribed on it. Originally standing beside the west gate of Shōfuku-ji Temple, it was first relocated to the Mikasa riverside during the Edo period, and then moved again to its current place in 2001. There is also a relief depicting the legend on the nearby Ishido Bridge.",

However, a lack of budget on the students' part led to it never being built. While Wright did finish the plans, it was never built in Wright's or even Beye's lifetime, and for a long time it remained the only unbuilt building in Wright's famous Wasmuth Portfolio, a German book containing multiple works of his that first skyrocketed his popularity across the world.\n\r\nLuckily, in 2007, construction began on this beautiful structure, with the assistance of one of Wright's apprentices. Today it not only serves its original purpose as a place for a boating group (The West Side Rowing Club nowadays), but it also holds weddings and tours, of which there is more information on its website.

This edition features the drummer of the British band Blur, Dave Rowntree, as told to Associate Editor Sarah Durn. \n\r\n\r\nI got my first telescope for Christmas when I was nine or 10. Growing up, I would spend hours and hours out in the back garden, staring up at the stars and planets in the shadow of our very conventional two-up, two-down, semi-detached house in Colchester, some 50 miles northeast of London. I would stick it out for as long as I could, until I got so cold that I had to come in. Ever since I've always had a telescope.\n\r\nAs I got older, I still carried on looking through telescopes, but the band started taking off in the 1990s, so that took up most of my time. Once I wa…",

Historically, it was an all-purpose piece of cloth; some wore it as a scarf, some wrapped bento boxes with it, while it was also used in place of a belt, bandage, apron, and diaper.\n\r\n One of Japan’s oldest continuously running businesses, Eirakuya was originally established in 1615 by fabric merchant Hosotsuji Ihe’e, a favorite of Oda Nobunaga—one of the most illustrious figures in Japanese history. The shop’s name derives from Eiraku Tsūhō, a Ming dynasty coin that widely circulated back then, so common that Nobunaga adopted it as one of his crests. Men of the Hosotsuji clan also wore the coin crest to show their loyalty to the samurai warlord…",

          "description": "Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana, who would later come to be known by the name of Sor (Sister) Juana Inés de la Cruz (Sor Juana for short), was a 17th-century writer who made an impact not only on the literature but also the religious establishment and feminism of New Spain, now Mexico. At the time, religious women were practically the only ones allowed to receive an education, so she joined a nunnery in her mid-teens in 1667.\n\r\nTwo years later she would enter Mexico City's Convento de San Jerónimo, where she remained cloistered until her death in 1695. From this convent, she wrote a large number of poems and philosophical treatises, many of which advocated for women's rights, which was a rarity at the time, especially for someone embedded in the patriarchy of Catholicism.\n\r\nSor Juana's impact continues to be felt to this day, and her habit-clad face has appeared on Mexican banknotes since the 1970s. A take on this same portrait is found in the Porrúa bookstore in the city's historic center.\n\r\nLibrería Porrúa was established in 1900 by the three Porrúa brothers who immigrated from Spain. Their flagship bookstore, where this mosaic is located, was opened in 1910; although the building dates to the 18th century. Their 1914 Mexican poetry compilation is considered the first modern book entirely edited and printed in the country.\n\r\nCombining the heritages of Sor Juana (who was considered Criolla, or entirely of European descent) and the Porrúa Brothers, this mosaic can be seen as a tribute not only to literature in Mexico, but also to Spanish-Mexican culture. Unveiled on November 12, 2020, the mural sits on shelves 4.8 meters tall and 3.6 meters wide, and is made out of books and artists' charcoal.\n\r\nThe date choice was not coincidental, as this was the 372nd anniversary of Sor Juana's birth. November 12 was also chosen as Mexico's National Book Day in 1980, again in honor of Sor Juana's importance, making this tribute doubly significant.",

          "description": "Sometimes referred to as the Oratorio dei Morti di Peste del 1630, this chapel was erected in memory of those that died of plague in the year 1630. \n\r\nThe history of this church goes back to the year 1044, when a deed was drawn mentioning a church dedicated to San Lorenzo, which indicated that this church was one of the oldest in existence at the time. Unfortunately, the original structure was destroyed to make place for a new fortification during the 16th century. While the old one was being destroyed, a new one was being constructed. Completed by the end of the 16th century, the new church of San Lorenzo alla Boccola is the very same structure that has survived to this day.\n\r\nHistory, however, took a sharp turn during the next century. An outbreak of plague that had spread throughout Europe finally reached Italy and, between 1629 and 1631, this pestilence claimed at least 280,000 lives—with some estimates putting the figure to 1 million.\n\r\nIn memory of those that died of plague, the Oratorio dei Morti was built next to the church of San Lorenzo alla Boccola. Above the door, it is believed that a semi-circular lintel used to frame a fresco by Vincenzo Bonomini. However, by the beginning of the 20th century, all that was left of this artwork were faint blotches, and it was decided that a new fresco should replace it. A young artist by the name of Emilio Nembrini undertook this mission, and the new fresco was unveiled in 1936.\n\r\nThe new monochromatic fresco is dominated by two main figures, Death and the dead, which are standing on each side of a slate that bears the following text: “resting here from the church move the bones of our brothers pray to their souls solace light and peace.” Although punctuation is not present, the meaning is quite straightforward.  To complete this somber composition are leaves, wreaths, skulls, and reclining pillars.",

He had wanted to be buried either next to his wife in Paris, or in Poland, but at the time both were occupied by the Nazis. President Franklin Roosevelt had Paderewski's body interred inside the USS Maine Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery \"until Poland is free.\"\n\r\nThe war ended, but Poland still wasn't free; it was occupied by the USSR. Paris was free, but apparently, that destination wasn't appealing to the custodians of Paderewski's corpse. It stayed in Arlington until after the Berlin Wall fell in 1991, when it was finally returned to Poland. Paderewski's ashes were interred in a crypt at St. John's Archcathedral in Warsaw.\n\r\nBut his heart stayed behind. He loved the United States so much that it was decided that his heart should remain here. It was extracted from his corpse and placed inside a bronze version of his head, which was then relocated to the Our Lady of Czestochowa Cemetery in predominantly Polish-American Doylestown, Pennsylvania. It's been there ever since.",

The first mention of Cerveno was in a medieval treaty stating that this village sided with the Ghibellines. Although the fortunes of this village waxed and waned through the centuries, the one thing that remained constant was its vineyards. A network of narrow roads snakes through the estates surrounding Cerveno. Some estates consist of vineyards and other crops, while others are completely covered with vineyard lines. Unsurprisingly, the art of wine-making is an integral part of the village’s identity.\n\r\nApproaching Cerveno from the north, there is a gigantic horizontal lever press (Torchio a Leva Orizzontale) nestled between the vineyard and some ancient buildings.

          "description": "Transporter bridges are rather unusual bridges. They don't have an elevated road or walkway crossing over a river, chasm, or any other obstacle. Instead, transporter bridges use a moving platform suspended under a boom to transfer people, vehicles, or other things from one end of the bridge to the other. They are usually built in locations where a normal bridge may not be functional for various reasons. For example, a drawbridge may not be practical in some locations with ship traffic, or if not enough space is available on either side of a riverbank for approach ramps leading to a standard road bridge, a transporter bridge might be a more practical alternative.\n\r\nTransporter bridges are also relatively rare. The United Kingdom currently has only three transporter bridges designed to carry vehicles, and the Warrington Transporter Bridge is one of them. The bridge was constructed in 1916 to connect two different parts of the chemical and soap plant operated by Joseph Crosfield & Sons. (This bridge was actually the second one built in Warrington over the River Mersey; the first bridge was built in 1905 but was later demolished in the 1960s.)\n\r\nThe steel bridge, which spans a section of the river that is 61 meters wide, has a height of 23 meters and a total length of 103 meters. The bridge was originally used to transport railway vehicles from one side of the river to the other but was later modified in the 1940s to transport road vehicles.\n\r\nThe bridge ceased to be used in 1964. It became a listed structure in 1975, which protected the bridge from demolition, but the bridge has been slowly decaying since. However, the people of Warrington are very proud of their bridge, and a group named the Friends of Warrington Transporter Bridge (FoWTB) formed in 2015 to raise awareness about the bridge as well as to work with Warrington Borough Council to try to restore the structure.\n\r\nThe Warrington Transporter Bridge may still be non-functional, but it has become one of the defining symbols of Warrington.",

          "description": "Towards the back of the biodiversity hall at the Australian Museum is a rare taxidermy specimen of an adult female thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus). With her golden fur and iconic rear stripes she stands tall beside a small, damaged pelvis of a dodo bird in an extinction display. This individual specimen was registered by the Australian Museum in 1902, 34 years before the last known individual thylacine died in captivity at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart. Upon close inspection, the taxidermist's stitching is visible along the marsupial's stomach and tail. These marks were made over 120 years ago.\n\r\nThylacines were once found across mainland Australia and New Guinea, but evidence suggests that its range was restricted to Tasmania around 2,000 years ago. Considered a pest by European settlers, thylacines were falsely believed to kill livestock. From 1888-1909,  a government bounty led to their depletion in the wild. As the species became rare, specimens became valued by zoos, museums, and private collectors. According to the International Thylacine Specimen Database, over 750 individuals are in collections spread across 23 countries.\n\r\nFrom around 1999-2005, the Australian Museum was involved with a thylacine cloning project and scientists extracted thylacine DNA from preserved specimens in its collection. Although the Museum no longer participates in this project, it is an active area of research in Australia.",

          "description": "The Decatur Waterworks was originally built in 1907 and supplied water to the city of Decatur until the 1940s, but had been utilized as a public park since the 1930s, when many amenities like benches, grills, and a stone bridge that crosses over Burnt Fork Creek were added. This same bridge is now part of the trail that connects Medlock Park and Mason Mill Park.\n\r\nBy 1939, the waterworks contained two storage tanks, an office building, two aeration and solid removal tanks, and two dams, one on Burnt Fork Creek and the other on South Peachtree Creek. By 1941 the city had outgrown the water capacity of the waterworks, so the property was leased out to Dekalb County. Dekalb continued to operate the facility and sold water to Decatur. Using the revenue from this venture, they funded a county-wide water treatment plant in Dunwoody, which is currently called the Scott Candler Plant.\n\r\nThe waterworks supplied the Naval Air Station (now Peachtree Dekalb Airport) during World War II. During this time absolutely no recreational use was allowed. When the war ended the waterworks was given back to the city of Decatur and acted as a backup for their new system. While the waterworks were in use, the park was not being maintained or publicly used.\n\r\nBy the early 1950s, the waterworks fell into a state of disrepair due to lack of use. Residents of nearby neighborhoods in the mid-1960s complained of flooding, and in response both dams were broken and the reservoirs were destroyed.\n\r\nThe Decatur Waterworks was declared a historic site in 2006 and shortly after this, the construction of a trail began in 2008. This trail has received funding from the PATH Foundation and has since been completed.",

For starters, this puddingstone is 370 million years old and strangely evocative of a human profile. The surrounding area is dotted with engraved stones bearing the poems of Emile Verhaeren.\n\r\nAccording to legend, Satan was enraged at Saint Remacle building the Abbey of Stavelot. To prevent the inauguration, he set out from the Pyrenees with a huge rock on his back, with the aim of throwing it at the church. But on the way, he met a poor man who told him that the road was still long. Discouraged and furious at not being able to arrive in time to spoil the festivities, the devil dropped his stone, which sank into the ground.",

If instead of going up the steep slopes and stairs that lead to the highest point of the promontory where the cathedral is located, you wander through the adjacent streets, you can find something hidden and often overlooked by tourists. A small exhibition that recalls Hollywood's Walk of Fame, but in this case, it is a wall of a house where some concrete plates with handprints (or footprints) of some celebrities, not only about cinema, are hung.\n\r\nMany of the celebrities on the wall hail from German-speaking areas. There are plaques of Germans like the singer Sandra Schwarzhaupt or the actor Fritz Wepper, the Swiss football player Fritz Kün who printed his feet, the filmmaker Fritz E. Maeder, the Austrian actor Ulrich Reinthaller, and Dutch actor Frijda Nelly. There are also representatives of Spain like the sculptor Miguel Ortiz Berrocal, businessman Enrique Sarasola, and the popular actor Penelope Cruz.\n\r\nThe origin of this concentration of celebrities maybe it is due to a local initiative and after continued by a program on German television in the 1990s from the channel SAT1 hosted by Margarethe Schreinemakers, which reached an audience of millions every week between 1992 and 1996 with her talk show Schreinemakers Live. It seems that one of the activities of the show was to appear with these celebrities in Ibiza, many of them linked to the Balearic Islands, to leave their immortalized prints.",

Despite this the lakes remain under the radar for most hikers and tourists visiting Alberta's Rockies. But aside from its beautiful view the lakes are also known for a tragic series of events in the summer of 1986 that gave them their name.\n\r\nHikers at the third lake may notice a large brick cairn on its shore, dedicated by the Alberta government, that lists the names of 13 people along with a quote. On June 6, 1986, a Cessna carrying wildlife biologist Orvall Pall, who was monitoring Bighorn sheep populations, and pilot Ken Wolff crashed into a forested section of Mount Kidd, killing both. Following the Cessna's noted absence, friends of the pilot hastily took off in their own Cessna to search for the missing plane. Only hours after the initial crash, the Cessna searching for Ovrall and Ken crashed into the side of the nearby Mount Lougheed, killing all three onboard.\n\r\nIn the following days, several search groups were organized to look for the two missing planes numbering in the hundreds, joining in these efforts included the Canadian air force and multiple other government agencies. Despite the difficult weather, the wreckage of the second plane was found on June 9th. Finding the first plane remained more difficult, due to the forested area it crashed concealing the wreckage. On June 14, a Canadian air force DHC-6 Twin Otter, searching for the first plane crashed onto a cliff on Cox Hill killing the eight people onboard and starting a forest fire, which hampered early efforts by personnel on the ground who witnessed the crash to reach the crash site.\n\r\nAn investigation into the third crash found that a visual illusion caused by the sun gave the illusion that the surface of the mountain was smoother than it actually was, it is possible that this same illusion could be to blame for the two other crashes as well. The wreckage of the first plane was found on June 18.",

It is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city as it is a very wide, peculiar building clad in glass panels, which has lent it the nicknames of \"crystal palace/castle\" and such.\n\r\nHistorically, the Sava Centar has hosted a wide range of events, including business conferences, trade shows, domestic and international concerts, ballet and dance performances, theatre plays, art exhibitions, and more. It is home to many of the most monumental political conferences that occurred in the former Yugoslavia. Today, it is still open to the public, who can go in to see its wondrous retro interior in a massive building that will leave you in awe of its uniqueness on every floor.\n\r\nThe construction of the Sava Centar began in 1976 and was completed in 1979. It was designed by a team of Yugoslav architects led by Stojan Maksimović, taking on a Yugoslav modernist or Brutalist style that was popular at the time. The complex was originally built to host the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as well as various other large-scale conferences, cultural events, and performances.\n\r\nNowadays, Sava Centar is a must-visit due to its 70s interior, which has been largely untouched as if to capture the vibrant and prosperous Yugoslav past of the city. There is a beautiful and very iconic world clock that you must see in the lobby, as well as admirable conference halls where history was born. There are areas of exquisite metalwork as well as a blue-stained glow from the main windows next to plants, quaint bar areas, stalls, and little local indoor clothes shops.",

In fact, there is also the Order of Malta, a Roman Catholic lay religious order that functions as a sovereign entity of international law, albeit without a physical territory.\n\r\nEstablished as an offshoot of the medieval Knights Hospitaller, the Order of Malta was, as its name suggests, originally based on the island of Malta, which was given to them in 1530 by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. The island was invaded by Napoleon in 1798, then taken over by the British Empire in 1814, leaving the Order of Malta without any territory.\n\r\nThe order was disbanded but restored in 1834 under the new name Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta. Its new headquarters was placed in Palazzo Malta in Rome, a 16th-century building owned by the order since 1630, and it was granted extraterritoriality in 1869 alongside its other headquarters, Villa Malta.\n\r\nToday, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM) is recognized by over 100 countries as an independent sovereign entity, maintaining diplomatic relations with them. It has its own passport, coins, and stamps, and Palazzo Malta's extraterritoriality continues to this day, functioning as the de-facto capital of the Order of Malta.",

          "description": "The Holy Roman Empire was dominant in Europe throughout the Middle Ages with many sites in Europe serving as a hub with palaces constructed for imperial activity. One such palace (Lofen) was in Utrecht, Netherlands. In 1253 the city suffered a fire that lasted nine days, during which it is believed Lofen was destroyed. The location became the property of the chapter of the Dom Church.\n\r\nMany iterations of development are believed to have occurred; the major ones presented as architectural rendering when touring the site.\n\r\nOn August 1, 1674, a storm hit Utrecht. Some say a hurricane but others a tornado which seems more likely as the destruction was very selective. The nave of the cathedral that occupied that site at the time came crashing down, largely destroying the church but leaving other buildings of the complex intact. Towers of 5 other churches and all but 2 windmills in Utrecht did not survive the storm. \n\r\nThe nave was never rebuilt, but the basic structure of the area is currently represented using different colored bricks to indicate the footprint of the nave and its supports. This area is now an open pedestrian walkway. \n\r\nHowever, near the center of this is a secured stairwell providing access to some of the original underground support structure of the nave as well as piles of holy stonework presented as rubble. The tour includes a CGI recreation of what it would have been like being inside the nave during its collapse, it's fairly terrifying.\n\r\nThough it is believed several people were killed during the collapse, only one skeleton remains and is also presented in this underground tour. Nobody seems sure as to who this was, which is odd as there is a headstone is right there! Most theories involve a patron of the church.",

          "description": "Located in the Seobinggo district of Seoul, the National Museum of Korea boasts a huge, impressive collection of ancient artifacts. Not only does it have thousands of items from Korea’s past dynasties—from Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo to Balhae to Yi of Joseon—it also exhibits a number of antiquities from Mesopotamia, Central Asia, India, China, and Japan, as well as the Greco-Roman world.\n\r\nOne of the non-Korean artifacts is a well-patinated bronze Corinthian helmet, dated to the 6th century B.C. It is an impressive antiquity on its own indeed, but it may be somewhat peculiar that it has its own exhibit space, considering how it is not the only Greek artifact at the National Museum, and that it quite possibly has more interesting items in its collection.\n\r\nThen, why does it have a whole room for itself? The answer lies in its history—not all the way back to Corinth in the 6th century B.C. but to Berlin in 1936. That year, world-renowned marathoner Son Kee Chung, alternatively Sohn Ki-jung (1912-2002), won a gold medal at the Summer Olympics, breaking the record of that time.\n\r\nThe winner of the 1936 Olympics was to be awarded the helmet, found in Olympia and purchased by the local newspaper, but the IOC decided that it was too valuable an item to be given away. More unfortunately, Son had to register and run not for Korea but for Japan—as Korea was occupied by the empire at that time—a status he was vehemently against.\n\n\r\nIt was not until 1986, at a reception in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Olympic Games, that he finally received the helmet. Until then, it had been displayed at the Charlottenburg Museum despite its rightful owner’s continuous efforts to have it back.\n\r\nOut of respect for the artifact’s historical value, Son donated the Hellenic helmet to the National Museum in 1994. The Korean government designated it as its 904th National Treasure, the only Western article to be given the honor.",

The writer and artist had just moved to a remote one-room cabin on Wyoming’s Casper Mountain with her two young daughters, Jean and Mary. Set high near a red sandstone butte that overlooks the valley, the 640-acre homestead, surrounded by aspen and pine forest, was a new beginning for the family of three in the wake of a difficult time.\n\r\nUnable to bring most of the family’s books, Forsling used her own imagination to entertain her girls, who were 11 and 9 at the time. She was inspired during an early morning walk by the deep red color of the sandstone, and came up with the idea of a world called Crimson Dawn. From that moment, the tales flowed: There …",

After a few days, they are ready to entertain local neighbors, offering them the most enchanting, cheerful, and, of course, wild, holiday experience ever created in a garden lawn.\n\r\nThese figures were originally designed by none other than Maurice Sendak, the author who is known for his whimsical children's books, such as Where the Wild Things Are. They were used as lobby displays for the Pacific Northwest Ballet's production of The Nutcracker, which was performed from 1983 to 2014, and of which the sets and costumes were designed by Sendak himself. Since 2015, PNB has done George Balanchine's version, with art by another children's author, Ian Falconer.\n\r\nBesides the iconic Sendak sculptures, this display is sure to please you during the holidays. From the enormous 15-foot Nutcracker to the lovely ornaments on the tree, this is a unique holiday experience unlike any other in the Seattle suburbs. If you look closely at the house's roof, you can even see a cutout of the Wild Thing from Sendak's iconic book. And, of course, the house even features the original stage props that were used onstage prior to their retirement.\n\r\nEven though this Nutcracker production no longer performs, its spirit lives on in this magical holiday wild rumpus, preserving a large part of Seattle's own holiday history.",

          "description": "When Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Hitler had elaborate military bunker complexes built throughout Masuria (then part of Germany, now part of Poland) in order to keep a closer eye on the war effort. While Hitler and his inner circle based themselves at the infamous Wolf's Lair, the Nazis' Supreme Military Command was located at a separate site called \"Mauerwald\" (now Mamerki) just 20 kilometers to the northeast.\n\r\nThe full Mauerwald military complex consisted of nearly 250 separate buildings and bunkers constructed in the forest just west of Mauer Lake (now Mamry Lake), the majority of which remain abandoned and freely accessible in the woods. The heart of the compound, however, is now confined within the Mamerki Bunker Museum, which seeks to preserve the core bunker structures. The museum is complete with underground tunnels and exhibitions on the Nazi war effort, including full-size recreations of daily life in the bunkers and other scenes.\n\r\nAdding to the location's lore, Mauerwald is also one of several locations theorized to be a possible hiding place of the Amber Room. Erich Koch, purportedly the last person to have known the room's fate, was brought to the site in the 1970s as part of the search, and ground-penetrating radar has also been used since 2016 to search for hidden chambers. Although the search has proved fruitless so far, the sheer size of the complex suggests that it may still have additional secrets to reveal.",

After the discovery of a new orebody in the Murphy Mine, the only significant producer, a revival followed beginning in 1872 and lasting into the 1880s. However, activity had largely ceased by 1890 and the post office closed in 1893.\n\r\nRuins of the mill and a brick-and-stone building that was probably the store still can be seen, as well as several roofless stone cabins. The portal of the Murphy Mine itself remains open, although entering it is hazardous. Unfortunately, several years ago the Forest Service razed some of the remaining stone buildings as public hazards.\n\r\nAfter the turn of the last century, there was only small-scale and intermittent activity on precious metal extraction. In the mid-20th century, however, tungsten deposits were discovered and worked near the canyon mouth. This lasted until the mid-1960s when the tungsten market collapsed due to the removal of the strategic-metal subsidies.\n\r\nLittle is left of the tungsten operations. A mill for tungsten to the south of the canyon mouth survived till the early 2010s but has since been torn down. A cemetery from the early days is preserved on the north side of the canyon mouth.",

The collection is called El refugio de la vida (the shelter of life).\n\r\nArmiño has his work on display in other parts of Alcorcón but it is here in the park that his best pieces can be admired together with the nearby Castillos de Valderas. Armiño spent months working on these pieces which were eventually acquired by the Alcorcón city council and carefully placed in the Parque de los Castillos in 2005.\n\r\nCarlos Armiño began his artistic career as a painter before shifting his focus to sculpture, a task to which he has devoted himself for years. He masters different shapes depending on the materials he works with. Considering that these 16 pieces would have to endure the harshness of both summers and winters in this part of Madrid, he decided to use concrete for the pieces on display at this park in Alcorcón but he has also worked with iron and wood, the latter being his great passion.",

In you next venture to Belgrade's western neighborhood, you will not miss this gem when you are met with what looks like a gigantic beige wall with a sea of little TVs plastered to it.\n\r\nHilariously, on the creation of the building, Yugoslav president Tito expressed the following to Arnautovic: \"I'm glad that you have decided not to build residential buildings higher than ten floors. This is good, because it is not easy for those who have to walk when the elevator breaks down. I am now also looking at those solitaires that have been built. There are very beautiful ones - most of them. There are also a few that, let me tell you, I don't like at all. For example, the ones with windows that look like a television.\" \n\r\nToday, the building is an object of debate amongst Belgraders. Some like it, some don't - the latter due to the fact that it looks especially cramped and uncomfortable to live in. Either way, Arnautovic's Blok 28 is home to a lot of unique buildings, with this one considered one of Novi Beograd's major symbols.",

(Model T Ford gear shifts were made of calcite from Cosmic Cavern.)\n\r\nThe cave contains many unique features, including the longest known soda straw in the Ozark Mountains, at nin feet long. One of the two bottomless lakes is the largest cave lake in the Ozarks. A cave diver attempted to find the bottom by throwing his air tank down a crevasse and shimmying further. While he survived the attempt, he did not manage to find the bottom, and no more cave dives were permitted.\n\r\nBut what makes the cave so unique is the secret area discovered in 1993 via dynamite. A hole in the cave suggested another room behind the end. This hypothesis was correct; the new chamber held untouched features and an additional bottomless lake. This makes a great comparison between what man's effect on the cave ecosystem looks like. The first part of the cave is covered in soot, invasive algae, and broken formations.  The new chamber is pristine, with some features completely transparent.",

The monument commemorates the establishment of The Servants of India Society on 12 June 1905 by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a prominent leader, and social reformer.\n\r\nAlong with him were eminent citizens like Natesh Appaji Dravid, Gopal Krishna Deodhar, Surendra Nath Banerjee, Anant Patwardhan, and others. The purpose of starting this organization was to bring about social reforms in the country, thereby uplifting the people. The primary goal was the promotion of social and human development.\n\r\n The society was founded on the belief that for the development of the country, there should be a group of dedicated, selfless, and intelligent people who will dedicate their lives to the service of the nation. The society organized events and campaigns that focused on eradicating social evils like discrimination, oppression, poverty, domestic abuse, etc. There was an emphasis on nation-building activities such as education, sanitation, health care, upliftment of the underprivileged sections, etc. The society worked to unite people of different ethnicities and religions for welfare purposes.\n\r\nIn recent times, on the occasion of the centenary ceremony in 2005, the monument was renovated and a tree plantation drive was carried out. The monument stands as a proud reminder of the efforts taken by the citizens toward the betterment of society.",

In High Desert, Arquette plays Peggy Newman, a former drug dealer–turned–Pioneertown Old West reenactor. Faced with foreclosure on her late mother’s home, Peggy starts moonlighting as a gumshoe, scaling the titular region of Southern California in search of curious clues to peculiar cases—all while fighting her own battle with addiction and mourning the loss of her mother.

Kruszyniany and its smaller sister village, Bohoniki, are the last Polish villages still inhabited by the Lipka Tatars, a Muslim Turkic people who originally came to Europe in the 1200s. The Tatars joined the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in every major military campaign of the time, notably the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, and as a reward for their loyalty, the Tatars were granted the right to settle in eastern Poland.\n\r\nOver the centuries, the Tatars adopted the Polish language and integrated into Polish society while maintaining their distinct religious and cultural identity. Despite their religious differences with the Polish state, they were considered full citizens who had earned their place in Polish society on the battlefield. After World War II, however, the resulting border shifts in Eastern Europe resulted in these Tatar communities being splintered between Poland, Lithuania, and Belarus, with only the villages of Kruszyniany and Bohoniki remaining within Polish borders.\n\r\nToday, Kruszyniany is the center of Poland's original Tatar community, and its modest yet impressive Green Mosque attracts visitors from all over the country who are interested in learning more about Poland's Muslim minority. The mosque is maintained by descendants of the original Lipka Tatars who are enthusiastic about sharing their unique history and culture with their fellow Poles and with the rest of the world. Across the street is also a restaurant (Tatarska Jurta) serving traditional Tatar cuisine with English- and Polish-language descriptions of Tatar dishes.\n\r\nKruszyniany's smaller sister village of Bohoniki, about 30km to the north, also boasts a traditional wooden mosque maintained by Tatar-descended locals who are happy to explain their history and religious customs to curious visitors.",

Created by the same sculptor or animalier, Emmanuel Frémiet, Dénicheur d’Oursons is another, and perhaps even more brutal example of this trend.\n\r\nAt first glance, it seems like a heroic statue of a mostly-naked huntsman wrestling with a ferocious bear in an almost Herculean manner, but if you look closer at it, you’ll notice a grotesque trophy hanging from the hunter’s belt: a dead cub. Once it’s been noticed, the implication is clear. The human invader murdered the mother bear’s little baby, and she is attacking the man in fury.\n\r\nThe huntsman has stabbed the bear in the neck, but it does not seem to stop the maddened animal. The strength put into its bearhug is deadly—and the \"cub snatcher\" hangs loose in its arms, facing the same fate he forced the poor child into. It's all very realistic despite its dramatic nature, from the man's musculature to the bear's furious fur.",

Like the Sorting Hat in the Harry Potter series, students were required to sit in the chair while they were tested on their knowledge of a particular subject.\n\r\nThe Blackstone Chair was made in 1775-6 and contains a piece of polished black dolerite, from which it gets its name.

It was Shaw's hope that passersby would use the shed as a place to stop and refuel as they traveled along the bike trail that traverses the island. Although she initially envisioned the bakery as a diversion, her pies were so good that it quickly became a destination in and of itself. \n\r\nShaw sources most of her ingredients locally and sells her wares on an honor system. There is no cash register, rather a paper log, Venmo QR codes, and a bird house where you can leave cash to pay for whatever you take. Along with sweet and savory pies, she sells granola, local maple syrup, cookies, scones and cakes, all made from scratch in her home kitchen.",

The Theater was, and still is, one of the main architectural and cultural landmarks in the city.\n\r\nConstruction on the building began in 1903 and its design was largely inspired by the Opera Garnier in Paris. Architect Ramos de Azevedo designed the massive theater with the help of Italian architects Cláudio Rossi and Domiziano Rossi.

So while the walled city of the living grew,  today known as Dalt Vila, some 550 yards away on the nearby hill of Puig des Molins, the city's necropolis also grew.

          "description": "The Clifton Suspension Bridge is one of Bristol's most recognizable landmarks, but not many of the people who walk across it don't know about the 12 vaulted chambers hidden below the Leigh Woods Tower.\n\r\nIn 1831, the young engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel was awarded the contract to build the Clifton Suspension Bridge, intended to be the highest and longest bridge in the world. Immediately, the project was plagued by problems and was eventually abandoned altogether in 1853. Brunel died in 1859, leaving the bridge only half completed. His plans and drawings of the Leigh Woods abutment were lost, and the 12 enormous vaulted chambers inside were forgotten. \n\r\nThe bridge was later completed in 1864, but it wasn't until the early 21st century that the chambers were rediscovered. A builder carrying out some repairs on the bridge found the mysterious vaults in 2002.\n\r\nToday, the vaults are now open to visitors between April and October each year. Two of the biggest chambers can be explored as part of a guided visit, where it is possible to see stalactites almost 23 feet long and squeeze through a small passageway into an enormous cathedral-style hall with amazing echoing acoustics.",

The pliability of churned, frozen cream makes it a great raw material to build upon—whether it’s covered in torched meringue to form a spiky, flaming mountain in Baked Alaska or shaped into a bombe floating in a sea of blackberry sauce to evoke a luminous, floating moon in Clair de Lune.\nBeyond ice cream’s shape-shifting abilities, it can also hold seemingly endless colors and flavors.

And it’s not only the fantastic view of the waterfall that makes this area worth visiting, it’s the walk itself. \n\r\nMany walking tracks in New Zealand are constructed and maintained by the Department of Conservation (DOC), and must meet a standard width for consistency. But here, you'll be walking single file as the winding path meanders intimately through the bush, bringing you up close and personal with the best of NZ native fauna and flora. \n\r\nLush ferns, mosses, lichens and native birdlife are abundant, even the tracks footing is made from pungas (native tree ferns) or nearby rocks from the stream. This magical walk offers a chance to experience being part of the bush, without disrupting the surrounding area. \n\r\nThe unique track was hand-made by two local men, Wayne and Peter, and is a labor of love spanning over 20 years. There is even a bench dedicated to their wives for the amount of time they've spent here. They still maintain the track to ensure safety and enjoyment. \n\r\nThe Catlins region has a rich Māori history, with abundant fresh seafood and forest food sources being a draw card for the first Polynesians. The remnants of their habitation are still found in the place names. In te reo Māori, Koropuku means lump or swelling.\n\r\nThe good news is you can walk the track any time of the year. It offers a refreshing walk in the cooler months, or a reprieve from the heat in the warmer weather, with a secret beach and swimming area at the base of the waterfall.",

Today, a visit serves as the perfect afternoon for fans of the macabre.\n\r\nRuthin Gaol was built in the late 18th century to replace a smaller \"correction center\" that was forced to modernize because conditions were so poor. It was expanded over the years and continued to function as a prison until 1916. After, the site became a makeshift munitions factory during World War II before eventually being partially converted into a public library and office space. Today, a large chunk of the building serves as the only purpose-built Pentonville-style prison (a prison that focused on isolating inmates in individual cells) open to the public as a heritage attraction.\n\r\nVisitors are free to explore the cramped cells, where inmates spent the vast majority of their days alone, and witness the various forms of punishments dolled out for bad behavior. These ranged from a stint in the dark cell to a machine with a crank-shaft handle that prisoners were forced to turn thousands of times, despite it not actually serving any purpose.\n\r\nVisitors will also learn stories about some of those who once inhabited these walls.",

          "description": "The Garza (Crane) surname is one of the most representatives of the Northern Mexican city of Monterrey and its metropolitan area, the country's second most-populated. This can be seen in the municipalities of San Nicolás de los Garza and San Pedro Garza García.\n\r\nMany families originating in Monterrey, therefore, share the Garza name, and it was one of these that established Xicotepec's first permanent cinema, the Cine Garza. Monterrey is the capital of the state of Nuevo León, so the seal of this state was prominently added to the facade of the theater. The cinema started its operations in the 1950s, while three decades later, in 1986, a restaurant called La Choza (The Hut) also opened in the town.\n\r\nIn the mid-2000s, after the Cine Garza lay abandoned for a few years, La Choza occupied the building, where it is still located as of early 2023. The cinema's lobby is now the restaurant's waiting area, all seating was removed to make way for the tables and chairs, leaving the stage where the screen was located as the main architectural heritage is still present in the restaurant.\n\r\nThe stage is still used for the occasional show as well as events such as book presentations. For the most part, however, it is merely a decorated feature that diners can enjoy while tasting some of the local Xicotepense delicacies served here.",

Within its walls is something that is often walked passed, missed, or forgotten about. Upon arrival at the Royal Institute, enter through the front entryway, turn to your left, and walk towards the main staircase. Atop the staircase is the oldest and perhaps the most valuable Morris & Co. stained glass work in Adelaide, also the only Morris & Co. stained glass window not within a religious building in Adelaide, which is often referred to as the “City of Churches.”\n\r\nWilliam Morris famously known for his London-based textile company, Morris & Co., was commissioned for several stained glass windows for the city of Adelaide. Almost all of them were located within churches and commissioned for religious reasoning. His work within the Royal Institute remains as one of his most valuable works to date, somehow surviving two fires during the 20th century, in 1938 and 1982 respectively, the stained glass window still stands in the main stairwell where it was originally commissioned.\n\r\nThe window was commissioned by Sir George. A. Brookman, an early mining mogul of South Australia and Western Australia, to commemorate the Australian Federation, an important moment in Australian history, in which the Australian colonies were joined together as a nation in 1901.\n\r\nThe window features six stained glass panels, with the lower three depicting the British Empire. Life-sized figures represent Australia and India on the left-hand side, Africa and Canada on the right, and Britannia in the center. Based on designs by British painter, Edward Byrne-Jones, a painter, designer and a founding partner of Morris & Co., the three upper panels represent morning, noon and evening. Upon closer inspection you’ll notice the central figure of Britannia is holding a wreath that frames the word ‘FEDERATION’, a nod to when the window was made.",

          "description": "The Poem Tree stood, for close to 450 years, on Castle Hill, at Oxfordshire’s Wittenham Clumps. In the 1840s, the tree was furnished with a carving by Joseph Tubb who etched the words of his 20-line poem into the beech.\n\r\nAs up the hill with labr'ing steps we tread / Where the twin Clumps their sheltering branches spread / The summit gain'd at ease reclining lay / And all around the wide spread scene survey / Point out each object and instructive tell / The various changes that the land befell / Where the low bank the country wide surrounds / That ancient earthwork form'd old Mercia's bounds / In misty distance see the barrow heave / There lies forgotten lonely Cwichelm's grave.\n\r\nAround this hill the ruthless Danes intrenched / And these fair plains with gory slaughter drench'd / While at our feet where stands that stately tower / In days gone by up rose the Roman power / And yonder, there where Thames smooth waters glide / In later days appeared monastic pride. / Within that field where lies the grazing herd / Huge walls were found, some coffins disinter'd / Such is the course of time, the wreck which fate / And awful doom award the earthly great.\n\r\nInspired by his admiration for the surrounding landscape and its history, the careful process of carving this poem, from memory no less, is said to have taken Tubbs two weeks over the summer.\n\r\nThough already 300 years old at the time of Tubb’s carving, the tree’s continued growth and development caused the poem to slowly become distorted as the years passed. With the foresight to know this unique poem had little time of legibility left, Henry Osmaston, a geographer in the area, took a rubbing in 1965 for posterity.\n\r\nThis rubbing was later recreated, alongside a transcription of the poem, on a stone close to the tree. Though placed in 1994 to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the carving, the stone now stands as a memorial to the lost tree and poem, since the beech collapsed in 2012.",

          "description": "San Pedro de Rocas is a fascinating and historic monastery in Galicia, Spain with a rich history that spans more than a millennium. The structure is a stunning example of ancient monastic architecture and dates back to the 6th century. Situated in a remote forested valley near the town of Esgos, the monastery's founding is shrouded in mystery. According to an inscription on a stone recording the monastery's founding, a group of religious men founded the monastery in 573. The monastery has also been linked to a Spanish knight named Gemodus, who, in the 9th century, is said to have revived the religious center. \n\r\nSince the 6th century, the monastery has undergone many changes and additions, becoming a vital center of religious and cultural life in the region for many centuries. The monastery is famous for its rock-cut architecture and intricate carvings, which are considered some of the finest examples of Romanesque art in Galicia.\n\r\nOne of the most intriguing features of San Pedro de Rocas is the tiny, rock-cut burial niches carved into the walls.  Another highlight is a faded fresco of a world map featuring the apostles. Located in the church, the map depicts the known world in the late 13th century. The fresco has been dated between 1175 and 1200. A unique example of medieval art, the map is said to share similar cosmological views with the maps seen in contemporary medieval manuscripts. The fresco is a remarkable work of art and a testament to the importance of San Pedro de Rocas in medieval Europe.\n\r\nVisitors can explore the site, which includes a church, cloister, and living quarters, as well as a nearby museum that showcases the history and culture of the region. San Pedro de Rocas is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in architecture, history, or religious art.",

Among its 1,262 articles, the Kanun permits blood feuds (gjakmarrja), in which a person is entitled to \"an eye for an eye\" in the form of murder as retribution for killing or dishonoring a family member in the name of justice. It was not uncommon for these feuds to last years, spanning several generations and resulting in the deaths of multiple men—and sometimes even women and children as collateral damage—on both sides.\n\r\nBeyond the Middle Ages, Kanun law persisted in parts of Albania, despite being outlawed by communist dictator Enver Hoxha. To this day, scattered blood feuds reportedly still exist, with some individuals isolating themselves at home in their villages, living in constant fear of eventual retaliation by a family scorned long ago by one of their ancestors. \n\r\nDuring feuds, male family members would confine themselves in towers called kullas to give themselves a defensive advantage over the opposing clan. The men would remain here until the ensuing feud was over, that is, until all males who posed a direct threat were killed, or until reconciliation was achieved, possibly with the help of a council of elders.\n\r\nThe kulla is located just off the main road in Theth, beyond the lineup of guesthouses. There are no designated opening hours, but locals in one of the neighboring houses will open the tower on request. At the time of writing, the admission fee is 200 leke.",

Most claim that it was always postmodernist poet and playwright Pilar de Valderrama, whom he addressed as “Guiomar.”\n\r\nToday, Segovia’s visitors can explore the curiosities that still inhabit the hostel/apartment Machado rented during those late years. The home is also quintessential of the Castilian lifestyle in provincial towns at the time. It's a multi-sensory experience that combines the traditional smell of old local wood exposed to the seasonal rigors, vintage books (including all Antonio Machado’s works in their original Spanish versions as well as translations into other languages), and reminiscent fabrics, all of it inundated with sunlight coming from every corner of the extremely narrow space.",

She has no priors about acts of service and what it means, but felt incredibly excited to keep at it. Why? \n\nWhat is it about the agent-agent sharing experiences that makes it intrinsically rewarding? What will make AGI have such emergent intrinsic rewards leading to empathy? \n\nOne is obviously imitation learning but that is not enough. The act of dissolving the agent and environment boundary is at the core of feeling good about such an action — this dissolution feels more empowering and therefore blissful. \n\nSimilarly if an AGI were to maximize this agent-environment dissolution boundary then we would get to emergent empathy. This is optimal for an AGI because it would end up maximizing its coverage in the environment while consuming as little energy as possible. Any duality between the agent and the environment means there is some internal thought or action — this requires compute flops. Killing a human is suboptimal for similar reasons — it is unnecessarily compute inefficient and destroys valuable information that is very hard to reconstruct. I feel like there is a principle here to solve the AGI alignment problem.",

          "description": "This article is structured in two parts. First, I summarize the <i>Building a Second Brain</i> (BASB) method by Tiago Forte. Then, I will compare it to the Zettelkasten Method (ZKM). I will first discuss the differences, because they can help to understand BASB and the ZKM more deeply. Then I will explain how to reconcile BASB and the ZKM. Spoiler: they can be combined perfectly. I have made some changes in my own way of working. I will include these as examples at the end.",

I reflected upon the fact that it was a return to a significant place from my past, where I’d been transformed in so many ways. Princeton was the first place I visited (not counting airports) in the USA, the location of my first postdoctoral appointment (at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS)), and its was there that I did a deep enriching dive into the hubbub of Theoretical Physics, at one of the very top places in the world to do so.<a href=\"https://asymptotia.com/2021/08/26/a-return-4/\">a post</a></p><p>After that, I moved West, to Santa Barbara, where my next postdoc position was at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), now called the KITP. I was very lucky to be able to go from one top place to another, and (as I’ve recently talked about in a BBC interview ) additionally, my field was in a delicious turmoil of activity and discovery. I was able to be a part of the maelstrom (the “Second Superstring Revolution”, and all the gifts it gave us, including better understanding of the role in quantum gravity of extended objects beyond strings (such as D-branes), the physics of quantum black holes, the tools to unlock the holographic nature of quantum gravity more generally (through AdS/CFT), and so on. (I've blogged about many of these topics here, so use the search tool for more.)<a href=\"http://asymptotia.com/wp-images/2023/06/SB_coast-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"Coastal view from UCSB campus\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-20071\" height=\"223\" src=\"http://asymptotia.com/wp-images/2023/06/SB_coast-300x223.jpg\" width=\"300\"/></a><a href=\"https://asymptotia.com/2023/02/03/the-life-scientific-interview/\">here</a></p><p>I’ve been known to say that Princeton was the place where I found my physics voice (Edward Witten was a key guide at that time). Well, to continue the theme, Santa Barbara (with its wonderful research group made up of people from both the KITP and the wider Physics Department) was the place where I started to learn how to use that voice to sing (with the guidance of Joe Polchinski (who sadly passed away a few years ago)).</p><p>Well, as you may be guessing after that long introduction, I’m doing “A Return” again, but this time not with some boxes and suitcases of things for a year’s stay: I can now announce that I’ll be leaving the University of Southern California (USC) and (as of 1st July 2023) joining [...] <a class=\"continue-reading-link\" href=\"https://asymptotia.com/2023/06/25/a-return-again/\"> Click to continue reading this post <span class=\"meta-nav\">→ </span></a></p><p>The post  appeared first on .<a href=\"https://asymptotia.com/2023/06/25/a-return-again/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Return (Again)</a><a href=\"https://asymptotia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asymptotia</a></p></div></div>",
